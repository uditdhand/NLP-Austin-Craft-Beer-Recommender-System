0,Carlton Cold,2.01,looks like beer smells and tastes like urine with a metallic taint to set your teeth on edge. in the worst rated list on ba and its place is well deserved. horrible! no longer abv 4.9% but reconfigured a few years ago into a 3.5% mid strength. i never tried the heavy version which a few members rate moderately.
1,Carlton Cold,2.23,september 2008: 375 ml clear bottle courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 4.6%. crystal clear pale golden colour fizzy with a big to moderate lasting white head. moderate fruity aroma notes of candy and citrus. zesty mouthfeel. the flavour is moderately sweet with some fruity notes minimal hops bland finish. not much to write home about here. far from undrinkable though.
2,Carlton Cold,1.02,i recently reviewed victoria bitter which i drank for old times sake by chance and it reminded me of one of the other beers i drank whilst in australia; carlton cold.  i wanted to review this beer because unlike vb which i liked at the time but recently gave a very poor review this beer i disliked even at the time so i wanted to see if it really is as bad as i remember.  my friend recently went to australia so i asked him ton grab me a bottle so i could review it.  poured most of a 355ml bottle into a 350ml beer glass.  poured a pale watery yellow with a very loose low head that disappeared almost immediately. no lacing.  nose was extremely disappointing. a faint hoppy aroma some other faint but unidentifiable aromas. maybe chemical. horrible.  palate. much the same as the nose; faintly hoppy and watery. no complexity or malt. horrible. probably worse than the nose.  mouth was watery with very loose medium to heavy artificial carbonation. horrible.  overall probably even worse than i remember. an almost unbelievably woeful attempt at brewing beer. breweries that churn out abominations like this shouldn\t be allowed to call it lager or beer. it should perhaps be called carlton cold - adjunct grain derivative  absolutely horrible. highly unrecommended.
3,Carlton Cold,2.95,carlton cold is filtered below zero degrees celsius creating a full flavoured fresh taste. the mid strength beer has subtle bitterness with a crisp dry finish providing an easy drinking experience.
4,Carlton Cold,1.62,format: a standard clear 355ml bottle with that old carlton cold macro label. i get the feeling that cub has dropped cold from being a full strength to a mid at 3.5% (as this bottle is) when they started their big advertising campaign a year or so ago. i used to drink cold at barbeques because i was a poor student. lets revisit it at 3.5% and see if it is any good.  appearance: poured out a light yellow in colour with a continual swirling cascade of carbonation. even with a fairly generous pour very little head pops up - just a light white cap and ring.  aroma: this has a smell? i got so close to try and smell it that i accidentally snorted some which was both embarrassing and a bit of a mistake. once it was clinging to my nose (and possibly my brain) i got wet cardboard and some cheap grains. great.  taste: a pretty damn awful cheap grain and corn adjunct dominates what little flavour this thing has. one of the rare few beers that actually makes me pull a weird face.  aftertaste: drops away quickly with just a touch of sweetness coming through from the grain.  mouth feel: light and watery in body with a mouth-filling carbonation. not great.  overall: for the sake of my many barbeque memories i will assume that the carton cold that i used to drink 10 years ago (the full strength 4.9%) was less bad than this 3.5% that you get now. this beer manages somehow to be both boring and taste bad. most of it was donated to the gods of the sink. its only au$40 a case but seriously just drink water or something. it certainly tastes better.
5,Carlton Cold,2.1,just a typical aussie macro lager. whilst the taste is not offensive and thankfully lacks the coin flavour that many others feature it is just so plain and unimaginative that i couldnt commend it in any way other that to say it does not make me recoil. basically water with a slight generic beer taste. ok for a knock-off beer after grafting on a stinking hot day
6,Carlton Cold,1.12,honestly and without hesitation i can say that i used to love this beer. when it was considered a heavy in the older style bottle and before the $5m relaunch. it had the crisp yet satisfying appeal but now that carlton have sucked the the living essence out the first beer i ever tried i will never be buying it again.  all i can say is good job to the dickhead who thought that that was a good idea.
7,Carlton Cold,1.28,this beers is crap when i open there is minimal fizz from the low carbonation in the beer its self. the aroma that comes out when first opened is putrid my fat chicks girlfriends shit smells and tastes and better than this and trust me i would know. give me a vb any day that shit is fucking holy water even better taken as a suppository.
8,Carlton Cold,1.57,this is the second of three australian beers my store has brought in and is surprisingly the most expensive one despite... on here anyway looking like the worst. i had to go for it though. my store to make any sort of decent margin sells this catastrophe for 4 canadian dollars per small 330ml bottle making it by far the biggest rip off in the entire store. nobody even gave it a chance as a $21 6-pack. i digress though.  the beer honestly looks pretty nice - it as a slightly darker shade of yellow than most adjunct lagers and has a copper-y colour to it that makes it resemble almost exactly the bottle of maple whiskey that is sitting on my table. not bad on that front.  the smell is also not bad. its got the standard adjunct smell but it has some kind of deep fruity smell that makes smelling it almost interesting and is not offensive especially considering the beer vatriety. smells good; looks good; what could go wrong?  well after the first sip i very well knew what went wrong. the taste of this beer is just bad bad bad. its a corny burst on the tongue with an explosion (no joke it felt that way) of sour aftertaste. going down the beer felt like straw... it was rough a term i dont even use much for heavy beers but that is what was going on. 1s for taste and feel for sure - i cant even finish more than 5cm of the glass it is just that putrid. do not want.
9,Vanilla Bean Assassin,4.86,12oz bottle…2022 version. drank 12/25/22. pours dark brown/black not much carbonation. smells of sweet chocolate vanilla and barrel. taste is marshmallows soaked in bourbon. perfect sweetness. if there is a knock it’s slightly on the thin side but that’s being picky. probably the best adjunct stout i’ve had. truly lives up to the hype.
10,Shiner Bock,4.44,a fantastic brew when had fresh on tap in season. does not age well in the bottle though. drink it fresh and you get saison qualities. a staple quality beer from my part of the country (oklahoma).
11,Shiner Bock,3.36,i tried a pint of this beer off the tapper at the united club at the houston texas airport. it poured a clear copper with fizzy white head that eventually dissapates and leaves no lace. the scent had german malt and grain presence. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with semi sweet german bock malt base with grain presence. the mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. overall it is a good beer.
12,Shiner Bock,1.42,choked one down. tastes like soy sauce left in the heat. over watery and smells like an old boot. i couldnt even finish the whole thing. mouthfeel is like sandpaper.
13,Shiner Bock,3,overpriced swill dont buy; thats what i think.
14,Shiner Bock,1.7,bad. watery flavorless tasteless. that\s all i have to say. can\t find 150 words to say mediocre. but at 103 i have to repeat watery flavorless thats it. ive reached 150.
15,Shiner Bock,3,tastes like the tap water version of michelob amberbock not a repurchase. the drill sergeant from full metal jacket might have been right about a few things is all i’m saying.  style: bock | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 4.5% | rating: 3
16,Shiner Bock,4.89,it kind of reminds me of coca cola but without all the sugar  its one of my go to beers for flavor and taste
17,Shiner Bock,3.85,if you hate on shiner you are probably: 1. young 2. not from texas 3. use beer reviews to feel better about your sorry life compared to todays brews it is certainly underwhelming and not particularly complex. for those of you living in austin in the early 90’s well before it became an unrecognizable doppelgänger of itself shiner was the best thing around. the revenge of the nerds of beers - dated but better than a lot of stuff that comes out in 2023. the eternal foil to aal’s.
18,Beer 30 Light,1,bought this when in college for a party. tasted of sour wine body odor and skunked beer.  there was beer left in the fridge at the end of the party. if already inebriated college kids wont drink it i dont know how it could ever be considered worth paying any amount of money for it.
19,Beer 30 Light,3,dude this is a light beer and the cheapest one do since all light beer tastes the same this should be the most popular one. it was about 12-13 years ago (because thats when the 08 recession hit and i closed shortly after) i sold it for $1 a can. we started calling it millionaire beer cause everyone pretended they were rich buying rounds for everyone.
20,Beer 30 Light,1,have only thrown up once due to alcohol in my life and this beer was the culprit. stinks of urine tastes like urine stirred with sweaty gym socks and leaves the heaviest nastiest hangover you will ever suffer from. avoid this beer at all costs. the worst excuse for an alcoholic beverage i have ever had the misfortune to imbibe.
21,Beer 30 Light,1.44,not as good as beer 30 ice. not got at all actually.
22,Beer 30 Light,1,i usually would never give any beer this low a score but it is the beer i will always remember not for good reason. i was in college and consistently drank terrible beer weekly. the usually adjunct lagers and even worse. this beer was unpalatable for me even when i drank bmc beers on the reg and thought they were good. a couple friends and i pick it up for a game of beer pong in college and left it sitting in the corner of the garage. it was awful. try it just to say youve had the worst beer ever made.
23,Beer 30 Light,1,i busted a party with some kids and they were drinking this stuff. smelled like old garbage and farts. one kid said they paid $8 for a 30 pack. thats cheaper than natty light. they were underage so i had them pour it out.  came back to that same house a week later for another underage party and the grass was dead in the spot they poured out last weeks batch. id avoid this swill
24,Double Sunshine,4.69,poured from the can into a lawsons branded tulip/goblet glass. canned april 26th 2023.  beamin juicy orange colored body with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation. three finger forming head a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily with light retention. still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well making a nice crowned appearance.  delicious aroma. hop pressing front nose with light citrus and faint touching juicy tropical notes. a nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality. comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality.  the mouthfeel on this is just unreal. an intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate. the mid hits with thick thick controlled orange and pine notes mixing sweet cream and orange and pine/earth heat. bitterness comes in the finish so ever slowly with first notes of tangerine and christmas spices then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness. campfire like warmth in the back palate that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine.  fantastic ipa and hardly any hint of big abv now that i think of it. just killer stuff.
25,Double Sunshine,4.85,this stuff is an absolute treat!  l: pours a deep golden yet clear in the glass. fluffy white head of 3 fingers lasts through the session.  s: smells of grapefruit citrus dank hops and sweet bread malt.  t: grapefruit and sweet malt dominates the beginning the hops come into play by this point and play very nicely with the grapefruit. these dank citusy notes do not overpower and keep the beer tasting fresh. it finishes clean especially for a dipa.  f: nice level of carbonation feels smooth and finishes clean. incredibly drinkable for a session. just be careful with dipas with this level of drinkability.  o: incredibly well balanced dipa with an excellent flavor profile. this might be my favorite dipa i have tried to date.
26,Double Sunshine,4.02,a little disappointing. overall a solid ipa but just expected better after having sips of sunshine. surprised at the perfect 100 rating. a more citrusy flavor than sips with a noticeable grapefruit taste and not as smooth. i’d recommend as a much lighter double ipa for those that don’t prefer the heavy types.
27,Pale Ale,3.75,a classic
28,Pale Ale,3.57,12 oz can acclimated to 49°f and poured into a nonic pint.  pours a nice clear copper with a 2.5-3 finger seafoamy barely off white head leaving little leaving.  initial aroma is caramel malt a little pine and really nothing else. after agitating i kind of just get a general grainy smell. smells good just simple.  initial taste before swallowing is very sweet with a cereal grain undertone and a dry hop presence. after swallowing i get more of all of the previous with the hops being bitter and dry and seemingly growing in bitterness as i enter the aftertaste its not terribly bitter but the intensity is high.  mouthfeel is smooth and goes down easily. the carbonation fades somewhat quickly but can be conjured for a short duration through agitation it lends a pleasant creaminess through its small bubbles.  overall its solid just simple. limited flavor notes in addition to a smooth mouthfeel but a relatively strong bitterness make for an ale thats easy but not too fast to drink. would make for a good beer for when you want to not think or when you want to think. want to turn your brain off? drink something simple. want to think about something? drink something that doesnt require much thought.  may buy again not something i would go out of my way for though. if its cheap ill consider it.
29,Pale Ale,4.04,a perfect 90 no higher no lower. a solid for its category with a very long and pleasant finish
30,Pale Ale,4.05,really really good. not aggressively hoppy nice malt character. fine pale ale.
31,Pale Ale,3.43,a decent beer although much too bitter for my liking. i prefer a smoother bite. overall 2.5/5 on my palette. once you get a couple in you it is much less bitter though i will adjust my overall rating to 4.0 overall as a standard beer its a nice stronger beer. if your not drunk its a 2.5 in taste if you have a couple in you its at least a 4.0 these are the facts of life its just the way it works god bless
32,Pale Ale,4.02,poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.  appearance: orange-ish golden in color; large creamy barely-off-white head that lingered long leaving abundant lacing.  nose: pine with a slight hint of floral.  mouthfeel: light-medium.  attack: lightly-toasted malt grassy citrus; the tiniest bit of caramel provides depth.  finish: the hop bitterness comes through strong but not too aggressively.  overall: i must admit to approaching this beer with more than a bit of reverence honoring its status as a long-standing statesman among craft beers. i’m not a hophead so neither pale ales nor ipa’s are my “go-to’s.” this beer however is worthy of its status and is an ale i’d be proud to serve and drink with food pairings that scream out “pale ale!”
33,Pale Ale,3.9,pours beautifully. dark amber with a generous frothy head. slight notes of pine florals and citrus but fairly subtle on the nose. full taste though; bursts of fresh florals grapefruit citrus and hops. really enjoyable classic pale ale.
34,Pale Ale,4.07,poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass.  look- pale amber mildly hazy visible small particulate off white creamy head average head retention and lacing.  smell- bready grassy pine grapefruit medium strength of scent.  taste- bready earthy pine grapefruit moderately bitter medium strength of flavor.  feel- medium body average carbonation moderately bitter highly creamy.  overall- pale amber and mildly hazy with average head retention and lacing. bouquet was malt forward with notes of pine and grapefruit. the flavor followed the nose well and was medium in strength. feel was medium body with moderate bitterness and highly creamy. overall this was a solid pale ale that provided a nice drinking experience but other than mouthfeel it was only slightly above average.
35,Pale Ale,4.4,finally leaving this one a review after all these years...  pours pale with some hints of orange slightly off white head ok retention but always great lacing when poured semi aggressively.  nose is an aromatic combination of light floral with some pine mixed in the malt is nicely present; very very lightly toasted in nature.  taste is nicely hoppy and balanced; a very nice malt ever so lightly toasty backbone that carries all the pine and grass from the hops.  light to medium body; very pleasing carbonation it has a softness too it; finishes with a dry and piney bitter and grassy bite.  the balance of this beer is always impressive to me it has a unique malt presence and pairs so nicely with the hops.
36,Miller 64,1.89,pours out of the can a crystal clear yellow with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly. smells like straw and sweet corn. taste follows the nose. not too much going on here. pretty watery
37,Miller 64,2.44,poured from the can into a standard pint.  a: light fizzy and effervescent as expected. pale straw color. solid tight white head.  s: faint grain. typical cheap pukey hop smell from aall type. aluminum can notes remain.  t: shockingly not as bad as nose. watery and grainy as expected. i do not hate this ice cold on a hot day like today was.  m: carbonation makes it so light that you hardly notice the underlying chalkiness but it is there i assure you. odd dryness with that bitter pill taste at ultimate finish when it warms up...did i mention to keep it really cold?  o: you might call this walrus piss. it is not intended to impress fancy beer palates. it is for long session days when you do not want to get arrested in a black-out drunken rage at the most redneck campground. you know where you overhear comments like the jailbird neighbors threatening physical violence to their tattooed floozey for not getting them another beer fast enough. it saves you from that embarassment.
38,Miller 64,2.06,12oz bottle stolen from my uncles fridge  this is so light its barely beer. very light scent and taste badly burned corn and maybe an ethereal kiss of hops like you can tell theyre there but youre not actually smelling or tasting them. this is a bust but on a low-carb diet there arent many options  bad even considering what it is...
39,Miller 64,5,great beer! to watch calories and carbs this is the best tasting beer yet. i would/will drink even when not watching weight. love the taste. it loses nothing in flavor. very crisp.
40,Miller 64,1.75,7/11/2021 9:10pm est fort myers beach fl  poured into a pint glass  look: straw yellow (srm 1) with a bright white and sparkling ocean foam head. lacing and head retention are pleasant.  smell: a faint hint of isolated oat and apple.  taste: a shadow of traditional miller. the nutty-like characteristic is present but very diluted.  feel: very light and watery with a delicate fiz.  overall: one could think about drinking a beer and it would be more like drinking a beer than drinking this beer. when the calories were cut so were the taste and abv. this is the opposite of a too high and intrusive abv beer.
41,Miller 64,1,ive had more flavorful bottles of water.
42,Miller 64,5,y do they change can sizes? they dont fit any can coolers ya twits.
43,Miller 64,5,ever since miller brewery came out with this lower alcohol beer i have been excited to be able to have the great taste of beer without all of the negative effects that i had been experiencing with the miller lite beer... i also dont have to take medication for heartburn etc. i am having a hard time understanding why i am having trouble getting the miller 64 beer! please dont stop distributing miller 64 here in pasco county florida the tampa bay area.
44,Miller 64,4.97,in my top 3 favorite beers  especially in the hot weather. why is this beer so hard to find ?
45,Miller 64,5,this is my favorite beer but it is not available at any of the many liquor stores in the trenton/hamilton areas. alot of my friends drink this beer also and our private club cant even order. what is going on with the miller company.
46,Miller 64,5,my fave!!! so sad i can barely find it now.... only bottles that are more expensive and in 12 packs... this beer is my jam! i can’t wait to have an ice cold can of it again!! nice and refreshing also great for someone that tends to drink fast! i chug everything i drink so this helps me keep my mind focused and still get to enjoy the fun! :)
47,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,3.92,i tried maclays on the recommendation of dj cosmo from chez 106.1 fm in ottawa. i think that it tastes better than the big brands and it costs less too.
48,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,3.08,i bought a can at the beer store in ontario 473ml at 5%. clear and good carbonation poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly disappeared but left a lace as you drink it. taste is light malty apple with a mild bitterness and skunky hop flavor. it feels like its watered down. overall its light and easy to drink. average . cheers
49,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.53,light colour decent yet not lasting head. overall it’s an ok beer considering the price point.
50,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,4.53,very good beer after a hot day in the garden. excellent value.
51,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.41,poured from the 473ml can into a tall pilsener glass. bubbly 1 inch head that diminished to a 1/4 but remained for longer than i expected. medium carbonation and attractive lacing for a few minutes after the pour. smell is faint and inoffensive - the usual hints of grain. emphasis on the first word in pale ale; very little hop flavour up-front although a bit of bitterness on the sides of the tongue and a mild hoppy bitter aftertaste at the back of the tongue. tastes watered down generally. as this is brewed by sleeman\s it carries the same profile - not too varied and drinkable. i\m sure this isn\t a faithful imitation of the original ale brewed in scotland which won awards at the turn of the 20th century. but at $1.95 a can at the lcbo it\s certainly not without its merits.
52,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,1.51,what utter crap masquerading behind a label with traditional pale ale and the association with scotland. i won\t even waste my time going through the indices in describing this concoction... cheap swill. period. even budweiser and tsing tao are a step above this shit!
53,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.48,wanted to do a formal review of this one so revisiting. 473 ml can served cold into a pint glass. purchased for $2 cdn.  appearance - weak pale golden straw color. decent finger of head was poured but doesnt last long. some visible bubbles and the tiniest string of lacing left behind. looks like a macro.  smell- some grainy notes and a bit of a cooked vegetable wrapped around metal vibe as well. smells like a macro.  taste - very bland i guess some coarse grainy flavor. tastes like a macro although probably a bit better than some.  mouthfeel - its wet and has a little less than average carbonation. feels like a macro.  overall - theres not too much good to say about this other than that it rates on par with macros and as far as english pale ales go its pretty bad. i suppose theres a bit of bang for your buck here but in this area why not pay 10 cents more and get spaten for an incredibly more satisfying brew?
54,Stickee Monkee,4.67,2014 bottle.  stickee monkee is a belgian-style ale brewed by firestone walker brewing co. this beer has received much recognition for its complex flavors and rich dark appearance. it is a sipper meant to be savored slowly and appreciated for its full range of flavors.  appearance: stickee monkee has a deep dark brown color with a hint of red. it has a fluffy beige head that quickly dissipates. the beer is slightly cloudy with visible sediment which is characteristic of a traditional belgian-style ale.  aroma: the aroma of stickee monkee is complex and full of depth. the beer has a strong aroma of dark fruit such as raisins figs and plums. it also has notes of caramel toasted malt and a hint of spicy earthy hops.  taste: the taste of stickee monkee is equally as complex as its aroma. it has a rich malty sweetness with notes of dark fruit caramel and toasted malt. the beer also has a slight bitterness that balances out the sweetness and helps to round out the flavors. the finish is slightly spicy with a hint of alcohol warmth.  mouthfeel: stickee monkee has a medium-to-full body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. the beer is not too heavy but it is substantial enough to make you feel satisfied after just one sip. it also has a slight alcohol warmth that adds to the overall experience.  overall impression: stickee monkee is an outstanding beer that is perfect for those who appreciate complex and flavorful beers. it has a great balance of sweetness bitterness and alcohol warmth that makes it a great choice for those who love a strong dark beer. the aroma and taste of this beer are incredibly rich and full of depth making it an excellent choice for those who want to savor a beer slowly and appreciate it for its full range of flavors.
55,Stickee Monkee,4.5,2021 version poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. after a short absence im glad to see this beer back. it is still the fine sweet goodness i remember.
56,Stickee Monkee,4.49,12oz bottle 2018 vintage that turned up in my lbs this week poured into a chalice at 47°f 11.4% abv. the beer pours opaque medium brown with light brown head. the head recedes to a thin ring and little else. no lacing. the aroma is moderate in strength featuring candi sugar raisin bourbon and leather. the taste is semisweet caramel bourbon and brown sugar with lingering tobacco oak and leather on the finish. minimal bitterness. the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a semi dry finish. abv is well hidden with just a touch of heat on the back end and no ethanol aroma or taste. overall excellent.
57,Stickee Monkee,4.16,rare 2015 vintage draught pour at apex bar in portland or. presented flat. no foam at all. deep brown borders on black. smells great. dark stone fruits and that famiiar quad on the nose. taste is toes on the line too sweet but it doesn’t become cloying or teeth-achingly so. i think maybe because it’s 7 years old some if the nuances intended have been lost. but the dark brown sugar stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew. feel is very dense quite viscous no carbonation. overall good to get a draught hit but 7 years of hiding has worn its beauty down.
58,Stickee Monkee,4.52,2018 vintage poured into a fw mini snifter.  dark brown pour with minimal carbonation. scents of candi sugar caramel and dried fruit. sweet flavor of candy and a warming finish. certainly a fine example of the style and one that aged well.
59,Stickee Monkee,4.44,2021 vintage consumed on 10-30-2022  a bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle. dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head with a fairly aggressive pour. the retention is decent and theres some lacing on the glass. the aroma is strong with dark fruit - i get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose. taste - tons of plum and raisin hit up front. theres a hint of caramel and toffee on the back. i also get a creamy flavor mixing in almost a lactose flavor. this last thing surprised me probably not getting it right. the body is very thick and full. smooth and very little alcohol burn. i love this beer and so glad i bought it.
60,Stickee Monkee,4.22,the beer is mahogany dark brown color. the beer fizz with sound while pouring but leaves a thin layer of foam only which disappears very quickly. the beer smells dark smoky brown sugar coffee leather molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. the wooden oaky barrel aroma is distinct it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.  the beer is full bodied velvety latte creamy with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. the beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?) with a bold palate with a bit sour (tart cherry) light bitter and subtle salty at back. the taste is great renders the beer bold but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. the malty backbone is strong and there’s dark sugar (turbinado brown sugar from mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. when i sip i sense some dark chocolate roasted chestnut nutty alcohol burn salted toffee candy leather and tobacco earthiness whiskey filled chocolate bottle dried fig and raisin aromas. the beer taste bold very malty and dark sugar characters but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. my feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile but just sitting still and sipping cigar. this is a malty beverage really malty i think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. i expect more layers in this beer but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy.
61,Stickee Monkee,4.5,2017 vintage... poured from a boxed bottle into a dogfish head tulip  l: dark mahogany grown pour... cloudy and with 2 fingers of off-white head. great retention/lacing.  s: rich and malty. brown sugars molasses spice and grains.  t.f: semi-sweet and rich. loads of toffee caramel and molasses. dark fruits... with fig and baked raisin. baking spice and plum. tobacco leather vanilla and oak. boozy and smooth. medium bodied... warming.  o: an elite belgian quad from california. held up superbly in the cellar and a pleasure to finally crack this one.
62,Stickee Monkee,4,sweet. too sweet.
63,Stickee Monkee,4.41,2021 vintage  sweet overall but with a lot layers to keep it interesting. brown sugar and toffee up front plus some subtle raisin. the end adds a nice lightly tart cherry note and subtle oak. the bourbon notes are smooth mellow and well incorporated.
64,Stickee Monkee,4.56,2016 vintage. poured at 54°. brown with ruby body; good clarity; quick beige head; thin ring poor cap retention no lace; thin legs. fruity esters; caramel malt leather tobacco candied yams. taste follows with caramel apple sweetness bourbon oak and brown sugar/molasses. feel is thin silk body is medium carbonation is light; faint warmth from 11.6%. abv. overall a wc ba quad style! no oxidation after almost 6 years the nose is heady fruity corse earthy aromas the taste is subtle - rich umami base with dancing sweeter notes of sugar fruit and belgian yeast in the higher register. a beer worthy of aging and may even advance another 2-3 years taste-wise - onward science!
65,Stickee Monkee,3.79,l: pours a reddish brown small khaki head fades quickly to a small ring no lacing. s: fragrant it is molasses burnt sugar a hint of booze. t: lotsa stuff going on here molasses tobacco coconut burnt sugar and booze. f: medium bodied not much carbonation. o: way to sweet i had a hard time getting thru this.
66,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),4.04,sweet malty not much hop taste. much better than i thought it would be.
67,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),4.54,i got the canned version and didnt know anything about this beer. it was such a pleasant mouthful taste and overall experience to drink. its smooth with light carbonation feel. it tastes malty and not too sweet. when i think of good beer this is what i envision and look for.
68,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),1.7,poured into a pint glass from a 24 oz can. looks like typical mass produced brew not bad and managed to leave a smidgen of lacing. reality hits you in the face once ya take a few sips. no depth just a sugary mess that coated the roof of my mouth with a taste and sensation that not even ai can identify. brought back bad memories of hangovers from early college days. drain pour.
69,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.34,look: medium dark orange with a fluffy white head.  smell: lights barley notes give way to sweet booziness. its almost sickly sweet.  taste: overly sweet with a touch of malt.  feel: thicker bodied than a standard lager.  overall: i wouldnt recommend.
70,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.58,rated for style: 8.1 malt liquor. its february 11th (2/11) 2023. drank from a 24 oz can in a trailer park. look: i honestly dont remember. i always drink it from a can (24oz) smell: nothing offensive. cant smell much probably because im drinking from a can. taste: like a typical aal with a sweet aftertaste. for an 8.1 very good. feel: not much carbonation goes down smooth overall: this is designed to give one a buzz quickly and is well suited to this task.
71,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.65,poured from a 24oz can  on the pour a finger of acceptable fizzy white head formed on top of a clear deep gold body. after 5 or less minutes there was zero head retention and it ends up looking like a glass of piss.  aroma is of stale 6-row covered by a big fruity mistreated yeast ester or phenol thing. not stinky like some of these hg malt liquors but not a pleasant lager aroma.  taste is an improvement on the aroma. at first sip it comes off as a bit bitter from hop extract and too many esters but the more you drink a soft (still stale) graininess comes through for a decently good for hg finish.  feel is dangerous for the abv. surprisingly easy drinking and smooth after the initial shock to the system. i can put down a pint of this just as fast as a lower gravity malt liquor or even an mhl. medium malty finish that is surprisingly pleasant.  overall this was a bit of a pleasant surprise. after anhueser buschs hurricane i just assumed all hg malt liquors were undrinkable swill but this one has detectable grain and vague hop bitterness making this one of the better ive had.
72,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2,shitty i guess but good. you know like your mom’s backside.  update 8/23: i am changing grade from 3 to 2. i don’t remember what it taste like but i like pbr better now. shout it from the hilltops.
73,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.5,now i may be biased in my enjoyment of natty daddys but as a person who only drinks diet soda never regular. accidentally getting these as a replacement to natty daddys as my cheap high abv drink of choice they are cloyingly sweet. almost undrinkable to me. i agree i may be obviously biased and while i huge opponent to ipas and other bitter beers a sweetness like this is not agreeable to my palate. hands down.
74,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),4.35,i made this account to rate this beer; amazing
75,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),5,love this beer. i am 76 years old and have been drinking beer for 58 years. this beer is the best i have had. fantastic!
76,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),5,it is not often i find a beer that i just love but this is one of a handful. i tend to enjoy beer that is not too bitter. this is very smooth. just the right amount of body. not fruity but not too earthy. overall i really love this beer.
77,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.2,lets not be verbose yeah?  looks fine smells like your standard citrus wheat tastes a little like fruity pebbles and is awful lite. crisp and snappy carbonation kinda saves the mouthfeel but i wont be reaching for seconds.
78,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,1.18,this was one of the nastiest tastings beers i’ve ever had. it looked good but tasted like apple cider vinegar. i guess if you’re used to drinking crappy beer then this is a good one. but if you’re used to drinking craft beer then this rivals the cigarette ash tasting miller lite. never again! this could be the last beverage on earth and i’d opt to die of thirst.
79,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.34,this is a refreshing beer. it pours without much of a head and is light looking. it has a distinct lemon flavor like the porch rocker variety but has more substance with the citrus and wheat flavors that accompany it. good served cold in season.
80,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.56,this is an okay beer. nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary but it is crisp vibrant and smooth as well as refreshing for the summertime. it has no real smell; perhaps faint lemon peel? the taste is faint lemon and citrus notes with a pinch of wheat. overall this one is worth a try when in season iced cold and if youve at least never tried it before.
81,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.21,pours murky yellow with a white cap that fades rapidly. minimal lacing. aroma is faint lemony and some grain. flavor is also mild citrusy and bready. feel is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. overall just another drinkable beer without any outstanding qualities.
82,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.38,this is another backlog rating where i know for sure ive had it and have a vague recollection of my thoughts on it. not sure how this slipped through the cracks all these years!
83,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.22,another american-style beer that is overly sweet to my taste this one resembles a higher-end version of modelo especial or miller high life. it does not have strong smells maybe has a faint hint of citrus but mostly has a nice easy not too intense taste with a lot of sweetness and a little more alcohol than is normal for this type of beer. i thought it was quite good for what it was but would prefer less of a confection.
84,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.57,a medium light haze in an orange-amber golden body. nose is citrusy - a little more lemon than orange but a mix of both. taste and feel seem a little watered down after that impression. it’s a little spritzy in carbonation but fairly light and refreshing with a medium dry finish. wheat influence isn’t as strong as i’d hoped for and the citrus is a little weak on the palate with a mix of orange and lemon peel coming out as it warms.
85,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.59,a great golfing beer. refreshing with a little taste.
86,Heady Topper,4.96,for me this is the goat. don’t want to repeat what has already been said but it just has an unbelievable balance and a je ne sais quoi that is extremely satisfying to enjoy. a beer that elevates the experience from a tasty beverage to something to transform the simple act of drinking into something more thought provoking. also for me it is much more balanced than focal which some prefer. cheers.
87,Heady Topper,4.52,poured from a 16 ounce can dated 7-31-23 into a teku glass.  look- medium gold very hazy frothy white head above average head retention and lacing.  smell- pine resin clementine nectarine dank earthy medium strength of scent.  taste- pine resin clementine pithy pineapple herbaceous high strength of flavor.  feel- between medium and full body average carbonation highly creamy moderately bitter mildly mouth warming mildly dry finish.  overall- medium gold and very hazy with above average head retention and lacing. bouquet was medium strength with notes of pine resin clementine nectarine and dankness. flavor was a great mix of pine resin clementine pith and pineapple. feel was between medium and full body mildly mouth warming and highly creamy. overall this beer provided a great drinking experience and was much more of a mix between a west coast ipa and neipa than a true neipa from todays standards.
88,Heady Topper,4.76,l - hazy yellow golden with a frothy white head that sticks around leaving behind a good amount of lacing s - bright fresh piney resinous bitter floral hops. malt and grass. t - fresh piney resinous floral bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with malt and cracker notes along with grass as well as citrus - grapefruit - and apricot dank on the backend f - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. crisp refreshing o - an incredibly well rounded imperial ipa.
89,Heady Topper,4.5,yeah ok it’s very good. great hop flavor. price point is a bit much but def worth the investment now and again. so seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!
90,Heady Topper,4.37,i had a chance to visit the brewery and have heady topper on tap and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.  aside from knowing its fame i knew little else. my first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as i expected. secondly upon tasting i was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western ipa than an neipa. not that its a bad thing im just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. most of my experience is with ny based neipas which do seem a bit different than vermont.  smell - it seemed more floral than fruity. the alcohol content also shone through a bit.  taste - wow. no ibu rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. the flavor really helps balance the bitterness. the pine and resin was strong albeit weaker than some great west coast ipas i have had. this was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. no massive grapefruit or citrus flavor i could identify maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.  the aftertaste was ... dark damp and lasting. in a great way. to me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. the stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.  and i must say i loved the brewery. beautiful and great staff. i literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. my only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area the food options were not strong and it closes at 6pm. another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes i only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.
91,Heady Topper,4.54,what? i never rated heady topper! great tude. greater vt. my sister brings this to me from vt. a) hazed golden standard with lace and last - tho brewer encourages us to drink from can which in a taste test turns out to be great advice. s) baked good floating an herbal piney floral sea. t) follows aroma through the full see saw of sweet and bitter woody earthy piney dank floral. f) smooth tongue kissy. o) deserves its pinnacle marks.
92,Heady Topper,4.8,the original! beer is incredibly hoppy and flavorful strong dank tones. this beer is good.
93,Don De Dieu,3.97,the pour is orange colored. the taste is banana coriander & clove. cheers! b
94,Don De Dieu,4.24,8/28/23 poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased from washington beer store...a mix six pack... gift from dw.  so so good! slight haze golden amber color. not much lacing and head disapates quickly.  very smooth mouthfeel. carbonation is not as high as expected. sweet apricots or apple taste. slightly drying at the end. goes down easy!
95,Don De Dieu,3.9,poured from 12oz bottle to a weizen glass. look is clear solid gold color with a dense white head that lasted a long time. clouds up quite a bit when you pour in the residue at the bottom of the bottle. smell is wheat bread apple some spice. taste is malt wheat cracker light clove coriander apple juice. feel is medium bodied solid carbonation. overall this is a good beer where the flavor outshines the aroma.
96,Don De Dieu,4.18,part of a unibroue mixed 6-pack. pours a dark gold color with a foamy white head that lasts quite a while. aroma of wheat and spices. taste is sweet and spicy. crisp and dry.
97,Don De Dieu,4.25,12oz bottle dated best before 5/31/25.  pours hazy gold with a half-inch head of white. moderate retention and lacing. coriander cloves red apples orange zest in the nose. medium bodied with a soft fluffy mouthfeel. spicy and phenolic on the palate with a light malt backbone and a balancing bitterness. clove-studded apples orange pith bubblegum zesty spice. finishes faintly sweet and spicy.
98,Don De Dieu,3.12,glass into imperial pint look: hazy golden straw yellow pouring a two finger head which dissipated into a nice thin cap smell: lots of doughy malt and yeast funk. some coriander orange zest and vanilla in there as well taste: doughy malt and orange zest. coriander and a apple cider like taste. finish is doughy and yeasty. feel: light-med body with a silky texture overall: i hope i got a bad bottle cause i love wheat ales but this is not for me
99,Don De Dieu,3.91,aroma gives off spice and malt. body opens with a bouquet of spice honey banana and more bready malt carried on a mouthfeel of satisfying carbonation crafting a very fun time. very nice
100,Don De Dieu,4.15,strong flavors of orange lemon coriander banana and clove-like spice. it pours a murky yellow with a lot of white head and has a nose of banana apple and wheat. notes of orange vanilla and bread. the mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a sweet and tangy finish. overall a fantastic beer that is easy to drink and has a great balance of flavors.
101,Don De Dieu,4.25,delicious tripel. i get mostly white grape and peach flavors with a nice creaminess. there is also a little breadiness as well. i actually prefer this to la fin du monde.
102,Don De Dieu,4.51,12oz bottle best by 10/14/24 into a spiegelau wheat beer glass. l: pours apricot dark gold fairly clear at base w a thin smooth & flat bright white head lots of fine carbo head recedes to a rich creamy skin no lacing. s: yeasty bready light honey banana caramelized malts grains citrus zest graham cracker light alcohol w warming. t: yeast sweet caramel malts floral honey banana a sensation of coriander doughy sweet yellow bread light alcohol w warming. f: gently sprite & brisk clean then soft medium-bodied feel w a plump center and a med-length lightly drying finish. o: a very easy drinking beer with great flavors and an overall lighter taste. this beer is brilliant expertly brewed and is outstanding. personally one of my higher rated beers.
103,Don De Dieu,5,i tried from the bottle amazing beer flavor of wheat sugar honey good carbonation overall awesome feel it’s definitely 5 out of 5
104,Don De Dieu,3.54,missing something from the real belgian tripel-- perhaps its missing the evolution from sharp coriander to a smooth sweet finish. instead this iteration of the umbroque line has a rather dull evolution while still hitting the right notes.  a bit disappointing considering since this was marketed as a belgian wheat beer. as such i thought it would be a quebecoise take on hoegaarden. but instead it was just a worse version of tripel karmeliet with some wheat notes.
105,Nelson,4,12oz can. date stamp on bottom reads bieb 8/23/23. cloudy straw colored body. one finger of white head which quickly dissipates to an interrupted head and ring. leaves behind some minor webs of lacing. aroma of berry and citrus orange with some tropical and floral hops. taste is dry with flavors of citrus tropical and floral. rye at the end. low bitterness and a balancing sweetness. medium mouth feel. crispiness in the mouth. good carbonation. tasty and totally quaffable.
106,Nelson,4.16,so what do we have here? a once legendary beer that has (allegedly) been bastardized beyond recognition. this was a long time want for me before i knew the whole story of it and ultimately ended up forgetting about it. however when i saw it on tavour i figured it was at least worth a shot. lets crack it open and see if its really as bad as some say  pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is quite vibrant here im not really understanding the complaints yet. im picking up on aromas of red grapefruit gooseberry grassy hops rye bread white pepper orange zest light papaya and white grape  its a bit less balanced in taste for sure focusing more on the bitterness but its still damn good. on the front end of the sip im tasting gooseberry earthy hops lemon zest rye bread grass overripe cantaloupe and light weed. the swallow brings notes of rye bread earthy hops black pepper lemon zest papaya pithy grapefruit light papaya and dank weed  a light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a snappy beer. finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness to keep things refreshing  maybe drinking this through the lens of not having had the original invalidates my opinion but i dont really care. this isnt perfect but a damn good ipa as is
107,Nelson,3.79,i first rated alpines nelson in 2015 and gave it a 4.41 average rating. its been the third highest of all the ipas ive rated over the years not quite 200.  in those early years (2014-2015) i had nelson on tap a few times. it was uncommon in seattle but always a treat.  well now i\ve had nelson in cans and i guess it\s the new nelson. i\ve read about some of the behind the scenes stuff on who\s made it. i don\t know the whole story but i do know that the beer i just had in a six pack is nothing too special. it\s nowhere near what i remember of the once ethereal beer. so i deleted my old rating as it no longer applies. this is a new rating/review as of july 2023.  nelson looks gorgeous big fluffy white head and golden color. the smell is piney. its a little out of the ordinary for a 2023 beer as its not a citrus bomb (grapefruit) like pliny and its also a long way from the fruity hazy taste profiles of ne ipas. its kind of old school which i like. however the rye character has pretty much gone missing and the nelson sauvin hop profile isnt nearly as good as i remembered. fortunately its still got a solid bitterness to it.  i guess im just pining for the og.
108,Nelson,4.23,found this on friday while returning from some hiking and stopped at total wine on the way back to the old line state. this is obviously a beer that needs no introduction and i wasnt sure if it was available on the east coast. opaque ultra yellow body like a latter day hazy ipa but the nose is more familiar citrus and grapefruit lending towards pine but still fruity.  the flavor is unique; very dry at the outset it seems pretty subtle but continues to develop and deliver throughout the aftertaste. high carbonation also hides flavor in the early stages before revealing grapeskin bread bubble gum melon and finally the promised rye. really nice luxurious mouthfeel is a highlight as well. i did not love the start but this one grew on me.
109,Nelson,4.4,2x12oz cans poured into a large dimpled stein while i smoke some salmon and relax on a cool saturday evening can says it’s best by today l: hazy yellow-tangerine colored body; frothy eggshell head holds great retention s: juicy citrus pineapple stone fruit wheat perhaps faint spicy rye t: rye is more prominent in flavor adding some spiciness and robustness; juicy pineapple tangerine mango and nectarine with bitter pine on the finish f: fuller body ample carbonation bittersweet finish with pine and citrus zest lingering with the spicy rye; very dry finish o: i love a rye ipa; i’ve never had one like this - world class beer here!
110,Nelson,4.3,a classic that i understand has changed throughout the years. sampled on tap. hazy orange with notes of citrus white grape lemon bubblegum bread crust and weed on both the nose and taste. low to medium bitterness with a medium mouthfeel and carb. a textbook well-executed nelson profile. white grape aftertaste. very good. each category is pushing 4.5 for me so i give this a 4.5 overall.
111,Nelson,3.75,pours a very hazy orange-yellow with a one finger head. aroma is oranges and to a small extent lemons. taste is clean and very orangey. this is a clean no frills ipa and that is also its strength -- it does one thing and one thing well.
112,Nelson,4.75,pours orange hue with a thick head. smells of citrus orange peel. taste of citrus hits immediately with orange and light pineapple. medium bodied and smooth. one of the best ipas i’ve had. worth it!
113,Nelson,4.2,my go-to ipa. pours with a bright orange with a thick white head. smells of orange peel. taste of mixed citrus and sweet fruits (pineapple orange) with a mild bitter finish. a little fizzy with a medium body.
114,Nelson,4.34,12oz can enjoy by date 02/06/23 into a nonic pint glass. l: pours hazed straw golden yellow w a thin white even head low carbo head down to a thick skin light drink-patterned lacing. s: buttery caramel sweet citrus hard pineapple candy a hint of plum light melon bubble gum or juicy fruit chewing gum overall fruity. t: candied pineapple caramelized malts orange tastes are mildly dense bright citrus white grape a little pull of sourness & tangy bitter undefined fruit rind. f: gently fizzy then smooth & glassy w a medium body and a residually brisk and bright citrusy med-long finish that is slightly drying. o: a very tasty and easy drinking american ipa with a very smooth feel. well balanced tastes lightly sweet with a subtle bitter linger. this beer is delightful and is world-class in its style.
115,Nelson,4.29,pours a cloudy yet bright sun yellow with a thick long-lasting white head. nice lacing. aroma is tropical fruit. flavor follows the nose sweet oranges and melon in front with a mild hop bitterness in the finish. feel is medium bodied and adequately carbonated. overall a very nice beer.
116,Nelson,4.39,this is a genuinely good india pale ale but it may not be for everyone. first of all its hazy but its not an neipa. secondly its dry and bitter which many of us love but if youre looking for a well-balanced beer in terms of hops vs. malts this is not for you!  nelson is bitter and i think it\s made with rye which accentuates hops but it\s also not hard to drink and is quite zesty in terms of hops meaning it\s less piney and more fruit forward (citrus but with layers of character and that\s cool because this is a single hop ipa obviously as the name implies). i like this beer a lot. it\s usually expensive it may not be canned by alpine blah blah blah...it\s great and if you like ipas it\s a must-try beer.
117,Nelson,4.04,can with unreadable date. gl tulip.  a: pours a turbid hazy yellow with three fingers of meringue-like frothy white head. no visible carbonation; it’s too hazy.  s: from a foot away i can smell the sweet tropical fruitiness. like papaya and gooseberries in syrup.  t: on first arrival hop burn; tangy tart tropical citric floral ending on a grapefruit rind light bitterness. there is a lingering bitterness that i actually find unpleasant. i think it’s the rye. i love rye whiskey but i can’t think of a single rye beer i’ve liked - including this one. the hop burn and sweetness on the arrival make it unpleasant as does the weird rye finish.  m: lighter side of medium pillow-soft.  o: i saw this on the shelf ten years ago and wanted to buy it but passed it up. i didn’t start seeing it here again until a year ago and that’s post ab acquisition. i wasn’t willing to get a six but i saw a single today and wasn’t going to miss it again. when this beer came out ten years ago it was revolutionary. not so much today. its beautiful to look at and smell and is still a great example of the hazy ipa style but strikes me as too fruity and unpleasant on the finish. at least it’s got a good name.
118,Sanctification,4.07,dated 05/30/14 and stored in a box down in the dark cool basement. poured in a fluted glass for a quick review.  a sparkling dark gold pour that produces zero foam and nary a carbonation bubble. the weak cork pop kind of gave away the carbonation deficiency. the smell is mostly brett funk and some light fruit. a taste that begins with white grapes followed by some brett funk and a hint of musty wood. the feel is slightly acidic and dry.  overall id say it has aged gracefully for being 9+ years old. a little more carbonation would have been nice but its drinking very well on a 90 degree afternoon.
119,Sanctification,4.4,from a 375 ml bottle for $20 (pricey) at monks in philly. poured into a tulip-like glass. bottled on 090517  in my opinion more sour than brett. straddling the line. 4.25  a - pours a clear very pale golden yellow with an almost zero head which faded quickly to just a thin constant ring around the glass. 4.25  s – brett aromas with some minor funk and a good amount of stomach acid sourness. minor citrus notes. 4.25  t - tart but not overly sour or mouth puckering. faint sweetness when coupled with the tartness reminds me of an oddly carbonated lemonade. no metallic or minerally feel like i get in some sours. 4.5  mf - medium light body with a dry tart finish. 4.75
120,Sanctification,4.24,375 ml bottle corked and caged. dated bottled 010919 so assuming january 2019  pours a crystal clear light golden in color the picture looks more hazy because its humid and there was instant condensation. bight pillowy head that condenses down to a thin cap but great head retention and leaves rings of lacing on the glass. bright slightly tart lemon aroma a touch of grassy funk. taste starts with crackery pale malt in the middle hits some floral and citrus notes then finishes quite dry. thinner bodied effervescent lively carbonation. overall very nice seems deserving of its #3 spot on the top rated list of brett beers.
121,Sanctification,4.11,pours clear with a lot of bubbles a 2 finger head. smells rich like it’s aged in wine barrels. tastes like carbonated dry with a little bitterness. dry feel more dry than a chardonnay.
122,Sanctification,4.32,serving: 375 ml bottle (“bottled on: 090721”) poured into a spiegelau beer tulip.  appearance: slightly hazy straw yellow with a sudsy cap of white foam and faint lace.  smell: yeasty pizza dough wet wool citrus blossoms.  taste: crisp light dry and delicate with farmyard funk minerals spice and a light acidity.  mouthfeel: light body and gentle but lively carbonation.  overall: complex yet restrained dry and refreshing with some nice nuance.
123,Sanctification,4.21,bottled 9/7/21.
124,Sanctification,4.3,bottled on 09/05/2017. enjoyed on 11/06/221.
125,Sanctification,3.84,pours a clear golden straw color with a massive airy semi-rocky white head that’s fairly quick to dissipate and leaves soap bubble lacing.  fairly dry woody aroma with maybe an underlying hint of clove.  super clean taste. a little wood a little clay very dry finish. very very faint hints fruitiness peak through at various points in the form lemon and grape but overall the taste exudes clarity and dryness.  light bodied and bubbly effervescent feel.  well crafted but a little too clean for my taste especially when drank next to other russian river offerings.
126,Sanctification,4.12,poured from a bottle- almost clear pale gold straw color with long lasting white foamy head. nose is funky with whiffs of fruit and wet hay. taste follows with a funky briney tartness. finishes almost dry.
127,Sanctification,4.71,this beer was very enjoyable. soft carbonation nice amount of tartness with sweet to make it very well balanced. very refreshing. if you ever see this on the shelves grab one.
128,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.33,mountain crest... you were once a good reliable cheap beer. i used to always have a case of you ready for the weekend. was it the contracts with liquor depot? was it because they dropped the price ubsurdly low? were you dealing with high demand issues and somewhere somehow quality control went out the window? come back.. i miss you.  seriously. used to be the best bang for buck beer on the market. now.. its swill. utter swill. this is my third attempt at revisiting a lost loved one. never again. goodbye mc. thanks for the memories.
129,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.4,crap beer. can u even call it beer.  bad mouth feel bad pours  sickly smell. these taste like apples in a bad way and taste like rubbing alcohol. most minhas products are to be stayed away from (ive had one good drink by them haha)   infected ass beer
130,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,4.03,i am an avid drinker of this in 355ml cans. it is not the best beer out there but such an underrated local beer at a fair price.  look -light golden/yellow body head doesn’t last long.  smell -citrus malt apple.  taste - citrus sweet apple crisp sour tangy after taste that activates the back end of the tongue.  feel - light coats the pallet for a shot time crisp.  overall -a great summer beer that is easily drinkable not watery not skunky very well priced if you’re local.
131,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1,this is disgusting !! the worst beer i’ve ever opened! it smells like apple cider vinegar and tastes like it !! i threw out an 8 pack because it was so disgusting
132,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,3.57,drank from a 12 ounce can. scores are based on the style.  look - very busy but kind of charming. it has a sort of simple 90s aesthetic to it. its not the most beer-looking but i like it.  smell - sweet and malty very powerful smell for an adjunct lager. smells more like a german dunkel almost. a good smell but on the verge of overpowering.  taste - the taste more or less follows the smell. very sweet very bready somewhat of a caramel taste. could use with some more bitterness to tone it down but its got a character that ive never experienced in this style.  feel - a weird creamy/soapy texture. not entirely pleasant. could definitely use with a bit more carbonation.  overall - never heard of this beer and have only seen it in one random store but for a $3 six-pack this was a good pick. way more interesting than most other adjunct lagers might come back to it if i can find it again.
133,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.25,just a beer. 2010/09/06
134,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.57,12oz can coded (17 285 19) poured into a perfect pint at fridge temp. beer is bright straw yellow with minimal white head and no lacing. even the perfect pint with a nucleation point could only keep a head on this a few minutes. aroma is an odd mix of malt and chemical. taste normal for an adjunct lager but there is a bad lingering bitter after taste that is not hop driven. mouthfeel is poor with sharp carbonation and a burning sensation to the tongue. after swallowing there is a thick persistent oily/soapy feeling that doesnt go away. overall this beer is flawed at the basics. i was hoping for a cheap lawnmower beer but this is not okay even judged only against other aal.
135,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,3.43,barely drinkable but not bad after a hot lawn mowing session
136,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.69,a typical grainy blonde lager pour with a surprising soapy and foamy head of three fingers. haze is present in fact it bumps the opacity to near 30%.  smells of cheerios or other breakfast cereal cut bananas and malty grain. actually an excellent nose.  holy sweetness batman. its like someone dumped sugar in my beer. the banana runt flavor is there which i like but then it turns cloyingly bad with lumps of sugar and malt mix. a pine stab very faintly finishes out the profile but it barely pushes through the overwhelming sweetness in this beer. notes of banana linger through the end.  creamy yet still carbonated but nothing exceptional. a little sticky in a bad way. ends wet.  overall this beer was way too sweet i dont think i could do two of these in a row. someone who drinks the 24 packs it comes in is probably prediabetic. ive had fruit beers less sweet than this.
137,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.53,sampled last night on 9/10/15. comes in a 12-ounce can that i paid 99 cents from no frills on wednesday. can chilled down to 36 degrees f in my beer cooler and poured in to a handled-glass stein cheers-boston glass.  brew pours a deep-golden yellow in color with a good 1-finger foamy/creamy head. decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped. aroma is of sweet grain for the most part. pretty much is said for the taste with lots of sweetness i am guessing from the grain they used. too much actually. funny that several times on the can they mention: craft brewed in small batches with a website with the three w\s followed by damngoodbeer dot com. well...ok then. lol! gonna say they they must like their own craft brewed in small batches better than myself (and many others) with all the comments here. anyway just a one time try for me for sure. medium-bodied with good carbonation.
138,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.68,cheap but tolerable malt liquor; love how they plaster craft brewed all over the can as if any beer enthusiast would confuse the wisconsin minhas brewery label with a craft-brewed beer (especially with the boisterous damngoodbeer.com website on the can as well). not at all bad very drinkable and if it came in glass 40oz bottle i couldn\t make the promise i\d never buy it again.
139,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.68,pours golden with a thin white head that has decent retention. some lacing sticks.  the smell is of an average cheap macro lager. something raw in the smell though.  the taste is of grain chemical and alcohol.  the feel is slick with solvent alcohol. it does have a certain crispness to it though.  for $3 a six-pack i figured that i would try it. its worth spending just a little more for miller high life in my opinion. this reminds me of a cheap malt liquor light. its not good - its actually pretty bad but not horrible for some reason. well a rated it for what it is. it is what it is.
140,Raspberry,4.23,on tap at the source.  a - big deep raspberry colored pour with big pink dense creamy lacing.  s - big pasty sticky twangy raspberry jam on the nose.  t - follows the nose with a big twangy raspberry jam with some puckering character and a lingering twangy raspberry jasmynness on the back side.  m - medium body and slight puckering.  o - this is nicy done.
141,Raspberry,4.32,nose is a huge pile of fresh raspberries. pallet is fresh raspberries with squeezed lemmon. it is a fair bit sour and tart but also with a touch of sweet too. feel is sour and light to medium bodied. its delicious
142,Raspberry,3.75,bottle from 2008.  pours clear copper with a ruby hue. zero head or retention. funky in the nose with raspberries. a bit cheesy. light bodied with a slickish mouthfeel. raspberries on the palate with a mild acidity. finishes tart.
143,Raspberry,3.62,so much of what the black rim nerd glass contingent in craft beer thinks is just not true. the story behind this beer will get around to explaining. anyhoo 10 years in the cellar you decide to break it out during a softball game because youre the whitest barely hispanic on your overwhelmingly brown latino team who absolutely love raspberries and the donald. yeah that one. actually 2010 bottle so even older.  anyhoo all geeked for it it pours a ruddy brown with light red/pink notes to it. claims of bullshit fill the air. i think we were up like 20-0 after 2 innings so this popped off celebration style. didnt amass much of a head but it was still carbonated. the aroma had a moderate amount of raspberry to it but also pervasive sourness.  the taste was enjoyable its easy to hurr durr acidity warheads teeth enamel jokes but this wasnt terrible. yes it was overly sour but thankfully michael crushed half the bottle. it seemed maltier than most lambics. i guess theyre calling it a wild ale now. makes sense. one dimensional raspberry + sour power. but whatever.
144,Raspberry,3.77,bottle from brewandbbq thanks for the opportunity! lightly hazy golden with a red tint to it light smattering of bubbles light carbonation. lemony tart acid with sweet and tart berry. pretty nice.
145,Raspberry,4.18,2018 vintage. aged 3 years drank in 2021. amazingly tart and juicy raspberry lambic - sour. well made and balanced.
146,Raspberry,4.02,really good sour raspberry flavor with a delicious malt aftertaste. slightly too tart but otherwise excellent.
147,Raspberry,3.93,reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 2012 vintage 750 ml bottle stored appropriately and opened on 1/21/18. poured into an el catador barrel-aged glass.  a: hazy to murky copper-ish red with quite a bit of visible carbonation. forms a thin white head that doesnt stick around.  s: big lactic sour with a much milder acetic tang underneath. big underripe raspberries and cherries and malic acid punch. lactobacillus funk cheese and feet. light cracker malts and i think a touch of woody dryness. maybe a touch of brettanomyces funk and dryness but it’s buried under all the lactic and fruity sourness. this isn’t quite nose-hair-searing but it’s smells sour for sure.  t: again a big lactic sourness up front. raspberry fruity accompanied by some serious malic acid. lactobacillus funk again maybe some pediococcus on the palate. cheese and barnyard and horsey. some light cracker malts then a sizeable punch of lemony citric acid near the swallow with more seriously tart raspberries.  m: average body for most american sours. carbonation sensation a bit towards the low end. low alcohol flavors.  o: this was a pretty darn tasty fruited sour even after extended years. the age seems to have rounded out some of the acidity at least compared to some of the other upland sours i’ve had. it’s not the most tasty or complex or nuanced raspberry sour you’ll ever have. but it’s enjoyable.
148,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,4.15,this beer is sold for $3 at most 711s. i think for a craft beer at 711 this is amazing. for a rating as a real beer its also solid. i think the 88 rating beer advocate has given it is just about accurate.
149,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3,new belgiums juicy haze ipa is self described as an ipa brewed with spice. im not quite sure what that means as it looks to be a hazy straw color with a white head and a fruity aromatic nose. theres a flavor thats trying to be sweet and gets about halfway before a gritty flavor/texture takes over. its not terrible but i expected more from a self described juicy ipa especially when they make some other juicier beers.
150,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3.83,poured from a 19.2 oz can with a best before date of 10/01/23 into a shaker pint glass. l - poured a hazy orange color with a fluffy white head. s - smells of citrus. t - tastes matches the smell citrusy with bitterness on the lighter side. f - soft feel with a medium body and carbonation. o - pretty easy drinking ipa for a 7.5 % ipa.
151,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,5,i tried this beer one afternoon and absolutely loved it. light slight tinge of fruit taste did not bloat my stomach alcohol level is perfect. great job!!
152,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,4.17,very smooth tasting. yummy
153,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,4,i dont tend to like the new belgium beers because they are a little too piney for me but this one was alright maybe because i enjoyed it with some salty snacks.
154,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3.85,this is yet another hazy ipa - nothing stands out about it. its perfectly drinkable and i liked it fine but theres not a lot to say here because its just like every other hazy out there. it is a touch higher abv than most checking in at 7.5% so be aware of that. but i didnt really get the fullness of flavor that usually comes with an abv at that point.
155,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3.75,12 ounce can straight up from the local gas station for $1.99. pops up and settles back down. tastes like every other common hazy ipa. it’s not bad. it’s not remarkable. knocks down the beer thirst on this scorching south florida july afternoon.. and just one will do.
156,Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA,3.68,voodoo ranger juicy haze ipa. bright and citrusy light notes of chocolate little to none of the 7.5 abv on the back end. a good beer will cover a high abv profile (wether you have to let it warm a little or not). this is one of those. cheers!
157,Thule Export Beer,3,thule from viking brugghus. picked up a rest stop stored overnight in hotel reefer. served at whatever temp the reefer is in a room glass. bottom of can stamped “bf 01 may 2022”. reviewed 31/7/21. note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. appearance – 4. first pour – light straw (srm 2) clear. body – light straw (srm 2) clear. when rear-lite same. head – average (maximum two cm) white medium density short retention fizzy diminishing to a 0.5 cm ring of bubbles and a thin cap. lacing – scant. a few broken pieces. aroma – 2.75 – begins grainy with dms no hops no malt no yeast. flavor – 2.75 – begins slightly bitter with a taste of grain no malt no hops no yeast. no ethanol (5.0% abv as marked on the can) taste or aroma. no gastric warming. no diacetyl. oddly no dms. palate – 3.5 – thin watery lively carbonation. final impression and summation: 3.25 looks good otherwise disgusting.
158,Thule Export Beer,2.5,nothing exceptional just a good local lager i guess.
159,Thule Export Beer,3.1,while gull is the most ubiquitous (and terrifyingly sweet) beer around reykjavik thule appears to be the preferred alternative outside the city.  its an absolutely okay american adjunct. light floral aroma medium sweetness decent cereal roughness. theres nothing at all exceptional about the beer other than its much more quaffable than gull.  this probably wont withstand international travel too well but if youre in iceland its a decent standby.
160,Brahma,1.36,nov. 2011: 330 ml clear bottle as brahma cerveja do brasil rio de janeiro - brasil premium lager. brewed and distributed by inbev uk ltd. luton lu1 3ls. abv is 4.3%. bought at carrefour cartagena spain. golden colour moderate white head. weak grassy and sweetish industrial aroma. thin mouthfeel. utterly bland and boring flavour nothing pleasant about it at all. the little flavour there is is metallic dusty cardboardy and industrial. stomach-turning and revolting. drainpour.
161,Brahma,2,akin to a weak mexican lager.
162,Brahma,3,b33
163,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.22,pabst blue ribbon. one of the most cheapest and popular beer on the market.  you have that corny smell. the smell is not offensive.  the taste is like the smell. but on the finish its terrible. and the after taste is not that great at all. maybe is because of the agent than sleeman put in their pabst but hey its drinkable and this is one of the best economic beer on the market.  would i recommend it ? sure for the price u can t go wrong with that.  would i buy it again ? no
164,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3,l: transparent yellow no bubbles or head. s: semi sweet and alcoholic grainy corn and skunky apple lager notes t: similar to the smell. its not overly sweet and it is somewhat flavorful although its not the best tasting. the taste leans towards the warm malts with some skunky hoppiness. not very bitter or drying. f: medium body a bit foamy feeling little carbonation. o: not as good as i remember but not bad. probably better with food than drunk alone.
165,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3.15,first time i tried this canadian version and the only reason was it was made by sleeman...poured a clear pale gold with a 2 finger puffy white cap that lasta....aromas are demure bready malts some grassiness...flavor is rounded and malty with enough hopping to balance clean drty finish from brewers rice hops become more evident....bready taste at the end...actually a very decent pre-prohibion american lager malty dry enough hops to be balanced quenching...no down side here
166,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.64,i have had this in bottles and cans but im basing this review of when i had it on tap which is my most recent tasting of the brew. its good for a low-budget aal and is nicely carbonated and was very crushable on a night out. i love my craft beers trappist beers many different beers but i judge beers by type. im not comparing it to a st bernardus abt 12 that would make no sense at all. i like it much better than coors light or molson canadian which are the usual beers on tap at the karaoke bars here. in the can pbr is not very good though.
167,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.29,have drank this stuff many times and i never really liked it much. its an ehh beer tastes ehh looks ehh feels ehh. been around forever and i even have a friend who swears by this beer. i prefer to swear at it.
168,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),4.18,it is an amazing cheap beer. sure its not premium beer but for the price you can\t go wrong. it pours about 2 fingers thick with a fast fading head. smells like a sweet malty hoppy beer. i swear i thought i smelled apples for a split.. macro.. second. lol. it\s kinda like how you wish budweiser tasted like. its got a sweet taste again i almost think of apples even tho its clearly not in the taste pallet but still... you can taste the hops or grains for sure so that ads to the authenticity of the lager. a surprisingly nice amount of carbonation and might be too much for some though as i hate micro lagers (they remind me of fizzy pop bleck!) very smooth going down and can easily drink 6 cans without a problem but then be in a problem cause i\ve just pugged 6 cans of some good brew and might need to take a walk and have a cup of coffee. leaves a slight bitter aftertaste but nothing special. for the price this beer is friggen good.
169,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3.49,overall the best bottom-shelf aal that is widely available hands down. there are others that i like better but are hard to find or overpriced. cant go wrong with pbr
170,Racer 5,1.41,i rated this great west coast ipa years ago with a rating over 4.4 under a now lost username. i have some bad news about my favorite northern california ipa. bear republic brewing co. of cloverdale california was acquired by drakes brewing co. of san leandro california early in 2023. newspaper stories of the time stated that drakes would be brewing racer 5 again from their brewery in san leandro. drakes acquired all of the bear republic intellectual property including recipes trademarks and packaging rights. well that was the story at least. i was a purchaser of racer 5 in 12-pack bottles. the cardboard boxes stated that it was brewed in sonoma county. on june 12 of 2023 i purchased what i believed to be bear republic racer 5 ipa. this cardboard box claimed racer 5 was brewed in san jose with a bottling date of may 11 2023. the brew contained in these bottles was not the same racer 5 that i dearly loved. the substantial layer of brewer\s yeast at the bottom of each bottle was gone meaning that this brew was no longer a genuine bottle-conditioned ipa. the head was gone. carbonation was nearly flat. the full-bodied ipa was now thin and watered down like any cheap canned ipa. odd smell and off-taste. the complex hops profile was absent and now tasted suspiciously of citra or galaxy. i made a call to drake\s and they told me that racer 5 was now brewed by gordon biersch of san jose. they assured me that when drake\s started production of racer 5 the boxes would be marked as brewed in san leandro. thats the miserable end of racer 5 for me. i will watch for future production of racer 5 from san leandro should that actually happen. sorry to be the bearer (no pun intended) of bad news.
171,Racer 5,3.65,aroma was malty and slightly piney medium carb two finger head. taste - very malty bready and thick with butterscotch notes. lots of sticky piney hop bittering. not sure how this differs from a new england ipa but nonetheless it aint no west coast ipa despite the fact its brewed on the west coast. so i guess for the style is right on. this is a classic ipa from bear republic so definitely a must try if youre an ipa connoissieur.
172,Racer 5,5,pours a delightful hazy orange with a voluminous off-white head that lasts giving epic lacing. smell is sweet caramel oranges apricots and slight honeydew. taste follows the smell nicely with no off flavors. a bit less honeydew in the taste and a bit more apricot and orange. sweet or perhaps semi-sweet... malt-forward but still quite hoppy with a lasting bitter finish. feel is very smooth and full-bodied; carbonation is moderate and just right for this style. abv is there but not pressing. overall an under-rated old-school west-coast ipa that is a must try for all die-hard ipa lovers.
173,Racer 5,3.86,poured from an unfortunately undated 16oz can  on the first pour an insane four finger head formed. pretty good retention too as it took me 6ish minutes to pour the whole pint into a spieglau ipa glass. after pouring i had a stiff rocky white sudsy head that left foamy lacing. body is a hazy golden yellow.  aroma comes off as sweet in a big beer sense but is immediately followed by big resiny hops with rhindy citrus notes in the back. like if pine sap was lemon scented? super hoppy but in a fresh herbal way. a touch of ale character in the way back.  flavor is smooth and drinkable with a wave of bitterness. tasting notes mostly follow the aroma but the sweetness dissapears completely due to the bitterness. full flavor implies a maltiness but the hops cover up any true malt character as typical for the style. lemony pine resin with a dry malt insinuating finish is the main experience.  feel is drinkable verging on dangerous for the abv. very easy to drink and quite smooth although the finish is quite dry and bitter. the dryness begins verging on astringency and im unsure if that is due to hopping rates or something else. very full with a medium long finish.  overall this is a decent legacy ipa. it\s super drinkable very beery and pretty enjoyable. bright herbal citric and overall hoppy this is what i thought an ipa tasted like when my mom explained hops to me as a kid and i still didn\t appreciate beer. classic old school ipa this is what a wcipa should be imo.
174,Racer 5,3.79,pours a golden color with a finger soapy head.  smells very bready with some piney undertones.  taste is of grapefruit pine and very feint citrus. bubblegummy after taste with little to no bite.
175,Racer 5,4.49,been some time since had a racer 5 - ?san francisco 2017?? pours a bright very slightly hazed golden with solid two fingers of tight bubbly just off white head. aroma of bready malt floral with touch of pine and big swath of orange tangerine and tropical fruit - underwhelming at first but popped as warmed just a touch (this is on me!). tastes an explosion of hops - citrus a bit of pine fruity with notes of mango tangerine; certainly a floral presence and a bright spicy bitterness that coats the palate balanced by bready caramel malt sweetness. medium full mouthfeel with a coating bittersweetness that lingers nicely. this is a classic for a reason and on a short list of desert island beers.
176,Racer 5,4.25,canned aug/28/22. poured a semi-lucid golden straw color with an off white pillowy 2 fingers high head that leaves a fair amount of lacing into a samuel smith imperial pint glass.
177,Racer 5,4.85,overall this is the epitome of a classic west coast style ipa. not overly hoppy medium to heavy body and the notes are more floral than bitter. doesnt taste like a 7% abv beer and would recommend checking out!
178,Racer 5,4.35,i haven’t tasted this beer in a long time. bear republic didn’t distribute in my area for a while. great beer! if an award was given for balance in an ipa it should be given to racer 5. light clear golden amber color. floral piney aroma. silky mf. piney spicy taste. not too hoppy.  gee- i’m getting nostalgic for the old days of the west coast ipas with lots of flavor balance.
179,Cerveza Cristal,5,excelente gusto
180,Cerveza Cristal,3,the pour is golden yellow with a steady flow of carbonation. the taste was refreshing with a mild herbal note. oh well it was interesting to try a beer from peru. cheers! b-
181,Cerveza Cristal,1.47,seems to be a cheap knockoff labatt or it seems to be. nothing special or worth noting. very bland and relatively flat.
182,Cerveza Cristal,2.25,you can say what you want about this beer it is not the greatest of beers by a long shot. however it is certainly a great beach beer and i am drinking the hell out of it while i sit on a cuban beach.
183,Cerveza Cristal,3.34,drank my moneys worth of this stuff while in cuba for 8 days...  serving type: can bottle and draught  l- pours a bright hay yellow topped by a 1/2 finger fluffy white head. half decent retention (great for an aal).  s- faint aroma of pale grain corny sweetness and a slight grassy hopiness. nothing bad here just nothing particularly noteworthy.  t- same as the smell. very mild flavours of grain and a grassy hoppiness.  f- light body and fairly high carbonation. refreshing would be a solid descriptor.  o- compared to most aals this brew is fantastic. it doesnt have anything offputting and doesnt really have much to offer. refreshing and cheap. if i make it to cuba again you can bet ill be putting back some cristal on the beach.
184,Cerveza Cristal,2.89,had countless cans of this as well as on tap samples while away in cuba for a week. served cold into a pilsner glass.  appearance -pale golden color clear with plenty of carbonation. a small cap of white head is poured and sometimes lingers.  smell - not a lot here some faint graininess in general and no off aromas so thats a plus.  taste - again not a lot of flavor light grassy flavors and a hint of grain with nothing off-putting.  mouthfeel - smooth and watery light bodied with just enough crisp carbonation to make things interesting.  overall - while not a great beer it really does hit the spot and when laying on a beach or poolside for hours under the hot cuban sun. a beer that very much can get some positive ratings due to the memories it invokes. for what it is it is quite good. dos cervezas por favor!
185,Cerveza Cristal,2.16,355ml can in santa clara cuba (30 pesos): quite a basic & fairly poor lager but not unlike what i was expecting going in really & at least it wasnt offensive or off-putting. there was a few skunky touches early on but for the most part the beer featured the usual corn hay & basic adjunct flavours but not much else. it was easy to drink throughout though probably due to the heat in cuba & as such i cant imagine its one id have again if i were in the uk & it was more readily available here.
186,Cerveza Cristal,2.54,can from cuba.
187,The Abyss,3.64,l - look is black like coffee bu with little head s- smell isnt potent smoky stout. t - the taste is of course the stand out. very complex. very bitter and earthy. possibly the most earthy stout ive ever had. i personally enjoy more sweet stouts where this is very very bitter and woody. however i believe the complexity and richness speaks to the craft and would be absolutely loved by some. f - feel is slightly bubbly and thick. o - as stated i want to like it but its not quite sweet enough for my tastes and its extreme earthiness is beyond my pallet. that said its enjoyable and worth a try.
188,The Abyss,4.96,aged leather gives way to notes of strong dark licorice. there are notes of burnt marshmallow in there as well as a taste of either ripe plums or fresh mediterranean figs. with an abv of over 11% this beer does not come off as overly boozy despite its aging in bourbon and french oak barrels. finally there is a finish of sarsaparilla and milky molasses.  this beer will only get better with age. i see this beer as mellowing its edges with another year or two (if you can wait that long) on the shelf aging.
189,The Abyss,4.91,awesome
190,The Abyss,4.06,unsure of the 99 rating. wasn\t impressed a year ago and not impressed a year after proper aging. dark chocolate and leather are present but there is a burnt characteristic to this that just turns me off. some astringency as well. interested to see 1 more year of aging on this to see what happens otherwise there are plenty of other barrel aged stouts out there i find to be much more preferable.
191,The Abyss,4.34,drinking a 2018 bottle (cellared). this ris has a roasted malt or grain characteristic which sets it apart from some of the others. it is not a sweet beer with lots of cherries plums or fruits. rather it is a dry dark and burnt character leaning towards tart/bitter end of the scale for me. it is like a dry ris. i like it. more of the bitter chocolate and coffee end of the spectrum. it is mellow and not boozy (for me). mouth feel is medium and not too chewy. just right actually. looks like motor oil from an old v8 that has not been drained in 20k miles. reaching for my 2nd one just now. this is a quality product from deschutes.
192,The Abyss,4.28,2017 reserve. bottled on 10/13/17. pulled this bottle out my cellar. was not sure what to expect but...it is still tasting great! i suspect that the wax over the bottle cap along with the hefty abv helped. pours jet black with a frothy coffee colored head. some slight hints of this beers age come through in the nose but not enough to be offensive. as many other reviews state there is a lot going on in this offering. every sip offers up a new flavor or aroma that i did not pick out in the previous. the barrel aged flavor complements this beer instead of overpowering it. the nose is the only hint that this beer has just over 5 years on it. overall an enjoyable and complex imperial stout.
193,The Abyss,4.11,12oz bottled 4/28/21 (nearly one year ago) poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 11.8% abv per label. the beer pours pitch black with no light penetration and light brown head. the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles. sparce lacing. the aroma is moderate in strength featuring chocolate roasted malt and oak barrel. the taste is bittersweet roasted malt with more subtle oak bitter chocolate and a moderately bitter finish. the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. the substantial abv is well hidden. overall very good.
194,The Abyss,4.27,no head. smell is rich dark chocolate cherry hints of coffee and bourbon. lots going on in the mouth— upfront cherry milk and dark chocolate hoppy pine bitterness caramel oak char coffee on the finish and a bit more hops. the barrel is there though it doesn’t dominate. feel is thick and smooth. the kind of beer that you can mull over and find all sorts of different things.
195,Barrel-Aged Framinghammer - Cocoa-Nut,4.54,bought this is a lot of old money beers off old money trading on facebook. i had no clue it was actually the #1 ranked baltic porter. i was somewhat letdown with the other framing hammers ive tried and i also dislike coconut in beers so i expect to be an outlier on my rating.  crack of the cap let out about a 2/10 intensity hiss. sounds mostly flat. *looks for bottle date*. *finds no bottle date*.  l - mostly flat dark chocolate colored. sitting astill or with a slight disturbance the liquid looks abnormally viscous for a porter . however once given a swirl the translucency through the darkness shows its lighter colors and awares you that it is indeed a porter and not a stout.  smell definitely has age. it honestly reminds me of pre-2015 bcbs. the good stuff that is. but less potent. bcbs hits you with a smack but this is much less robust. but the aromas themselves are so 2014 bcbs its uncanny. tobacco marichino cherries less the cloying sweetness mustiness.  taste. actually massively more excited to try this than i initially was when i cracked it 10 minutes ago. hopefully ive canceled out my prior preconceptions of it given the containing coconut.  its smokey ashy just the right amount of sweetness coinciding either just the right amount of bitterness. normally with big barrel aged beers i get less of a congruent and fluent profile - that is i may taste big sweetness up front followed by offsetting bitterness on the finish. this animal is quite put together though. from start to finish it tastes so even keel its impressive. perhaps on the finish there is an actual bite of hops not there prior (which is crazy because i never taste hops in barrel aged stouts young or old). but through and through its unwavering.  flavors are not heavy on the sweet/dark fruit like the bcbs i was expecting. i get no coconut. smoke ash and char predominate - which is as a smoked beer lover is probably why im finding this so good. oak and vanilla. loads and loads of heat for a 10% beer. its very very very well done bourbon barrel aging. its nuanced and extremely complex.  feel is a letdown. likely the age. mostly flat not dense and [not to its credit or discredit] almost oily on the tongue.  overall i would have loved to try this fresh and have zero regrets about getting to try this at its estimated 10y ears old of age.
196,Barrel-Aged Framinghammer - Cocoa-Nut,3.3,barrel aged framinghammer – cocoa nut from jack’s abby. purchased 10/20/20 for $10.59 (including tax) for 16.9 oz bottle ($ 0.627/oz) from shangy’s in emmaus pa. reviewed 12/10/20. undated. below the left edge of the label etched into the glass in near-microscopic characters “80114e2122229”. on room temperature shelf at store and stored at home at 42 degrees. served at 53.2 degrees in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. final temperature 58.6 degrees. appearance – 4. first pour – amber brown (srm 18) clear. body – black (srm 40) opaque. when held to direct light same. head – large (maximum four cm aggressive center pour) fawn high density average retention diminishing to a three to five mm jagged crown and a thin partial cap. second pour produces a tight 1.1 cm head. lacing – fair. narrow bands of extremely tiny bubbles connected by thin columns. aroma –4 – strong cocoa no malt no hops no yeast. lasts. flavor – 3 – begins slightly sweet with weak chocolate and no roasted malt no hops no yeast. no bourbon or barrel flavor. no alcohol (10 % abv according to ba not marked on container) taste or aroma although a harsh oral and gastric burn does occur. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. palate – 3 – thin watery lively carbonation bordering on fizzy. final impression and summation: 3 after deducting 0.25 points for no date and 0.25 point for no abv – i shouldn’t need a secret coder ring to see how old and what abv my drink is. looks good smells good. could be made with vodka and powered chocolate. seems a bit thin for a baltic porter. overall extremely disappointing and very overpriced.
197,Barrel-Aged Framinghammer - Cocoa-Nut,4.4,a - dark brown pour with caramel colored lacing that clings to the glass nice legs to.  s - roasted cocoa chocolate malt light bourbon cherry and delicate char.  t - bourbon oak cherry vanilla roasted cocoa light char and finishes balanced with a lingering roasted chocolate char and bourbon oak on the back side.  m - thick viscous and silky. warming in the back of the throat is minimal for a 10% barrel aged beer.  o - this is a pretty fantastic beer. recommended. dark brown pour with caramel colored lacing that clings to the glass nice legs to.
198,Barrel-Aged Framinghammer - Cocoa-Nut,3.94,pours opaque dark brown in color with 1/4 inch head. taste is cocoa fudge and light coconut. heavy bodied sweet slightly roasty with moderate carbonation. solid--good for the style--but middle of the road of the framinghammer variants that i have had. i want the coconut to pop more like other variants.
199,Barrel-Aged Framinghammer - Cocoa-Nut,4.53,went down memory lane today uploading my notes for previous framinghammers had now having this bottle feels right. best baltic porter series out there? coconut chocolate vanilla and wood all accent the bourbon licorice and a kiss of coffee. taste mirrors this only the coconut steps it up who knew licorice and coconut go great together with earth leather and the chocolate is fudgy. feel is the best of the series: warm booze smooth malts adjuncts percolate and wood even shapes a little.
200,Barrel-Aged Framinghammer - Cocoa-Nut,4.4,l -- same as the other bba framinghammers very deep brown body with two fingers of light tan head produced with moderate pour. some retention and lacing s -- coconut dark chocolate dark roasty malts ash bourbon oak vanilla t -- mostly reminiscent of the regular bba framinghammer with a slight milk chocolate/marshmallow kick. the coconut character is fairly light compared to what ive gotten to used to with trilliums coconut-forward offerings but it is noticeable f -- medium+ mouthfeel medium carb. full bodied and drinkable  88/100
201,#9,3.67,chilled 12 ounce bottle straight up. i haven’t seen #9 in some time thought it was discontinued or something. random grab at a total wine in miami.. no date stamp scared me a little.. same as i remember - by no means a bad beer (no such thing right?) has an old skool crisp pale ale vibe to it. unpretentious and sublime. nice to quaff one again..
202,#9,5,i personally love this beer i saw alot of 3.75 rating which was a shock to me. this beer is a classic of the 90s and is still going strong for good reason. i am currently sipping one and im 32 years old. i remember seeing the cap with the hypnotizing swirl on it and witty sayings in the cap when i was just a kid. when i got older i started drinking these and understood why my parents loved them. i hope this beer stays around long enough for me to keep enjoying my childhood. as weird as that seems with this beer and reading the caps it reminds me of the good times i once had when i was little growing up in the 90s. i miss that free spirit attitude everyone had and the beers taste helps me reminisce those awesome years.
203,#9,3.74,this beer pours a clear amber color with a moderate white head. the aroma is sweet and yeasty. its has a pleasant sweet fruity taste. a good session beer.
204,#9,3.91,classic indeed - early gateway beer that i drank the snot out of so many times. ton of interesting and titillating flavors combined. would love to revisit this one if its still brewed.
205,#9,4.5,not heavy refreshing classic taste
206,#9,3.75,poured from a 12 oz can from a variety pack. pours bronze like with decent foamy head; rapidly recedes. the fruit and field style threw me off as it tastes more like a standard lager. meh.
207,#9,3.92,pours golden yellow with a 1/2 white head which lasts. moderate lacing.  aroma is floral caramel light citrus grassy hops.  taste is caramel citrus light pine.  light to medium body moderate carbonation. dry finish.  pretty decent pale ale. less bitterness than an ipa.
208,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.79,heineken newcastle brown @ 4.7%  served from a 6pack of 330 ml bottles a-pour is a light brown from the bottle to a dark brown/amber in the glass with a medium size light creamy tan head leaving a fine spotty lace ring along the pint s-roasted nuts t-caramel malt  bit of a watery finish mf-ok carbonation  medium body  kinda filling ov-not a great pub beer  but i could see myself drinking some playing darts or billiards prost lampertland
209,Newcastle Brown Ale,4.22,poured from a 12oz bottle into a fff pint glass. pours brown with ruby red edges and a khaki colored foam head. heavy malt on the nose and taste. nutty with a slight hint caramel. easy drinking with a full mouthfeel. haven’t had one of these in years and while this bottle was brewed by lagunitas it still reminded me of the old bottles i used to consume as an early twenty something kid.
210,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.81,look: brown on the pour which yields an off-white to beige head that builds and quickly settles to a film leaving spotty lacing behind aroma: caramel toffee warm brown bread piloncillo light roasted tree nuts and wafts of earthy notes taste: starts out with subtle bready malt notes along with the bread layers of sweetness trickle in with caramel and piloncillo being the dominate two. closes with bread and earthy notes mouthfeel: full clean medium-high carbonation soft and smooth and fairly soft on the finish overall: this is good stuff. a classic og and the first “big bold and flavorful” microbrew i tried besides the few aal’s i had had at that point in my beer journey almost 18 years ago and still a good one. good malty nutty and sweet flavors in good combination with enough earthy hop presence to not come across as sweet. fun to revisit and recommended if for some reason you have never had it
211,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.92,i miss the old clear bottles with & it being brewed in england. i believe its made in colorado now. still a decent little brown ale. nothing special.
212,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.64,pours a dark shade of brown crystal clear light brown dense and creamy head; retention in form a thick uniform film; moderate initial lacing.  nose is caramel malty sweetness weak watered down coffee some darkened toast and damp woodsy smell.  taste is malty sweet a dark toffee like taste weak earthy coffee with minor generic hop note on the finish.  body is light but slightly sweet and syrupy to me smooth though with a low but noticeable bitterness on the finish.  i liked the flavors of this beer a lot but it was just a little overly syrupy on the tongue to me.
213,Hahn Premium Light,2.14,look: standard mass produced adjunct beer. golden straw colour. very thick dishwasher shop head approx 3 fingers thick which quickly fades away to a thick almost whipped cream texture  smell: light grainy bitter smell. citrus lemon again somewhat dishwashing up liquid   taste: sweet malty grassy grain dry after taste  feel: light watery refreshing if drunk on a hot day and the beer is cold.  for a light-alcohol full strength beer its got enough flavour and just enough body to be enjoyable. its watery but more flavour than some mid-strength beers on the market.  its as bland as the rest of the generic australian lagers but you do get to have a few and still be sober.
214,Hahn Premium Light,1.26,wouldnt normally go anywhere near this sort of beer  but a situation meant it was that or nothing else im far more into quality over quantity these days  and as i was about to drive home  a non alcoholic decent ginger beer would be a far more satisfying choice tasteless in the extreme  i honestly dont see the point of drinking this ...truly awful
215,Hahn Premium Light,2.27,asked for australian beer on a qantas flight and this was what they had. clear golden color with white head. light grain smell. light feel with plenty of carbonation. light malt flavor with a dry finish. ok but nothing to recommend it.
216,Hahn Premium Light,2.27,crispy and light. nothing too fantastic.
217,Hahn Premium Light,1.02,taste like shit. i would prefer to have coca cola instead of hahn premium light
218,Hahn Premium Light,2.98,a clear pale and lively golden yellow with a small fading white head. aromas of grass grain and corn following onto the palate similarly. light body and a watery mouthfeel medium carbonation and a low-intensity short length bitterness in the finish.
219,Hahn Premium Light,2.24,had this early while watching hockey. figured light would be best at 10am. from notes.  a - poured golden bright one finger of fluffy white head. good drapes of lace all the way down and a film of retention.  s - light malt sweet grain dried leaves.  t - dried leaves again sweet grain. quite grainy. not overly good.  m - quite dry in the finish with good carbonation light body. seemed really dry.  o/d - unpleasantly dry. an odd beer. the dryness was funky and the flavours werent pleasant. wouldnt get it again. the alcohol doesnt exactly give you any bang for the buck either. even though its so light it still has an unpleasantness.
220,Enjoy By IPA,4.1,ive had 12 other enjoy by date beers . they all were rated a 4  one a 4.5 all were 9.4 % this is a hazy ipa pours a yellow haze with nice hop sell a great beer to grab a couple six packs// just had their 10-31-22 an it was amother great ipa smooth citrus and hoppy
221,Enjoy By IPA,4.6,stone enjoy by 4-20-22 hazy ipa 9%. smell is a bit dank & tropical with a little alcohol. i can taste a hint of alcohol followed by the tropical sweetness and nice hop flavor on the back end that lingers. this is another winner by stone brewing.
222,Enjoy By IPA,4.53,appearance: translucent pastel gold. proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth that’s white as an untouched snowcap. modest retention gives way to sudsy webbed lacing.  bouquet: a mango pineapple peach smoothie rife with tangy citra and bright tangerine-sweet amarillo woven together with slender strands of earthy mosaic.  feel: full-bodied and thick with hop oils the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous peach fuzz carbonation.  taste: a huge chomp of just-ripe yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel. then lemony citra and the tropic sweetness of amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct new earth flavor of mosaic hops. concludes on a long low afterburn of hop bitters and sauvignon blanc.
223,Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,4.9,#107 yummy!
224,La Fin Du Monde,4.34,re-reviewing because it’s been a dozen years since i last reviewed this.  16oz can (date code a2623 so packaged 1/26/2023) into a hennepin glass. pours a beautiful glowing deep golden color with a nice fluffy bright white head.  aroma is funky and bready grassy. yeasty esters clove spice. overripe fruit. banana bread.  taste is sweet fruity funky. more bready yeast (or yeasty bread) malty sugars spice. old world hops. some residual grain. a vaguely bitter clean finish.  mouthfeel is soft smooth full bodied. reference-level carbonation. exemplary for the style.  overall this is still one of my favorite belgian tripels—la fin du monde never disappoints. _____________  previous review (6/21/2011) preserved for posterity:  4.44/5  rdev +2.8% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle best before 7/9/12 poured into a tulip.  golden yellow beer w/ a huge bright white head that defies gravity leaves behind a beautiful film of lace.  nose is all belgian yeast clean pale malt and slight alcohol.  taste is just so smooth. pale malt sweet candi sugar overripe banana and a slight warming from the alcohol.  mouthfeel is luxurious so seductively smooth and drinkable.  overall an outstanding version of the style. this beer would be a perfect pairing with so many foods strong enough to stand up to anything but never dominant. just a world-class beer that i think anyone would enjoy.
225,La Fin Du Monde,4.28,poured from 12oz bottle to a goblet glass. look is the color of honey with an off white creamy head. very active carbonation keeps streaming to the cap. smell is spicy and fruity. a good dose of clove and malt. taste is sweet up front with a blast of clove honey and malt. middle of the sip gets briefly bitter then hits with some candy apple sweet/tart flavors. finish is alcohol more spice and a bit of malt. feel is medium bodied with soft plentiful carbonation. that creamy head never goes away and allows for a nice soft mouthfeel. overall i am enjoying this beer. ill be working my way through the sample 6er. this is a nice drinker that id have again. the alcohol is clearly present which forces you to slow down and just enjoy.
226,La Fin Du Monde,4.79,in competition for one of my favorite beers of all-time. its everything a tripel should be. the funky yeast is complex with lots of dessert-y flavors. reminds me of boston brown bread when cold like sweet molasses. opens up wildly when it warms up. malty with spices honey-toasty-mead. a stand-out even amongst top-tier world-class beers.
227,La Fin Du Monde,4.35,part of a unibroue mixed 6-pack. pours a gold color with a minimal head that lasts quite a while. aroma of wheat and spices. taste is spicy with a good alcohol warmth.
228,La Fin Du Monde,4.57,this is one of the only tripels produced outside of belgium that i feel truly embodies the style. world class yeast flavor and i dont say that lightly. a very refined beer indeed.
229,La Fin Du Monde,4.14,honey gold transluscent no lacing fairly short lived 2 finger white head in a tulip glass. long lasting carbonation rising. smell = flavor: clove no detectable banana imo. moderately heavy body with relatively lively carbonation. very nice but had hoped for a little more complexity given the world class rating
230,La Fin Du Monde,4,orange/copper cloudy huge white head lasts and lasts. clove like smell with an intense phenolic aroma. i don’t detect a lot of banana. tastes sweet cloves syrup dark bread. no hops are detectable but i’m sure there’s enough there. mouthfeel is medium heavy. not your grandpa’s lager.
231,Golden Monkey,4.55,a solid affordable tripel. not quite as complex as la fin du monde. funky with sweetness and banana-spice-bread-y nutmeg/allspice to balance. flavors linger on the palate in a pleasant way. its well worth its price.
232,Golden Monkey,4.19,i notice the rating as a little lower than i would have thought and my question is where are you gonna find a widely available american tripel for this price and quality?! pours a bright orange cold with nice head as per the style but doesn’t explode out of the glass. smells funky yeasty moldy as expected. taste is of the heralded spice light clove and banana some other fruit and a crisp hop bite at the end. it’s similar to belgian ales but it’s also it’s own thing. a solid version of one of my favorite styles kudos to victory for this beer and i’ve said it before but it bears repeating; i like this brewery!
233,Golden Monkey,3.19,sugar spice and something mystiqal. complex flavor profile combines banana citrus spicy phenols and a well-balanced malt and hop. smells spicy tastes fruity & spicy medium body and soda-like overall an easy tripel.
234,Golden Monkey,3.87,really like the spice element. reminds me of boulevard 6th glass a bit. very refreshing with a bit of a punch.
235,Golden Monkey,3.79,12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter.  fairly easy drinking tripel dry and spicy with enough sweetness from bready malt and dried fruit flavor to balance the sharp spicy bitterness. mouthfeel is medium-light with crisp edges.
236,Golden Monkey,4.47,poured from 12-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. hazy almost opalescent dark reddish-amber in color with an evanescent white head that collapsed to a thin ring. lovely aromas and flavors of the typical belgian tripel with notes of dark fruit caramel dark bread coriander orange zest and of course yeasty funk to round it out. medium bodied well balanced not at all boozy and a clean and mostly dry finish. i could envision sitting around the dinner table breaking bread and drinking this with a bunch of trappist monks. whatever your dreams though this is worthy. highly recommended.
237,Golden Monkey,3.86,poured from a 19.2 oz can with a drink by date of 2/09/2015 into a snifter glass. l- pours a medium to dark amber color with a frothy white head that dissipates quickly. s - smells spicy. t - tastes fruity and spicy. f - medium body and carbonation. o - nice boozy tripel.
238,Golden Monkey,3.81,may as well keep the tripel train going! this was recommended to me by several patrons at my beverage center so i picked one up in a stovepipe (19.2oz) can for $2.49.  l: pours a translucent golden-amber with a 3 finger rocky khaki head that dissipates into a decent cap. minimal lacing is left behind.  s: light malt sweetness mild banana mild fruitiness and mild hops. fairly mild for a tripel.  t: flavors follow the nose but the fruitiness is a bit more pronounced. mild apples pears and banana mix with the malt. there is an alcoholic bite in the finish. not bad but definitely not as good as others in the style.  f: smooth yet slightly rough around the edges. medium bodied and ample carbonation. definitely not as smooth as others in the style.  o: this is fairly good especially for the price. cheaper than la fin or westmalle but you get what you pay for. if this is all you have available to you in the way of tripels itll do the job!
239,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.56,2023? draft at churchkey. didnt really meld together for me. not much other than sweetness.
240,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.9,#173 fantastic!
241,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.57,750ml waxed and capped bottle into a bbt snifter.  pours pitch black rich and dense. huge dark mocha colored legs. no head no lace. nose is mocha chocolate hazelnut and slight overtones of barrel. just as advertised and amazingly rich. beer opens rich milk chocolate hazelnut and mocha coffee. layers of molasses vanilla and lactose in the middle. more chocolate hazelnut and pancake syrup in the back. the barrel character has mellowed out significantly at this point but the adjunct flavors are still bright as day. somehow not overly sweet given the flavor combination. long lingering finish and aftertaste. body is spot on. rich thick and chewy. coats the palate. long lingering boozy aftertaste.  this beer is impressive. really nice balance in the flavor. i dont know that i want too much barrel so as to not drown out the other flavors here. definitely worth trying.
242,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,batch 1 retro review. big hazelnut and coffee. minimal coconut and barrel. nice and sweet; altogether it worked very very well.
243,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.85,the coffee melds wonderfully with chocolate vanilla and bourbon; stupid thicc mouthfeel with a chewy booziness that lingers.
244,Kaliber,3.55,from a bottle: pours a nice dark and clear amber color. when held up to the light i see a decent amount of carbonation bubbles rising in the glass. the head that forms is slightly off white and fairly thick - 2 finger. decent head retention and some pretty nice lacing on the glass. nose is malty and somewhat one note - rye bread. this is what i get and i get a lot of it. taste - is like the nose - rye bread. the rye really seems to have 2 phases to it: it starts out a bit mellow then it really builds on the back. theres a slight earthy flavor that also shines through. lighter bodied but not watery. crisp and bubbly feeling. damn! i really like this beer. very well made overall and this is one i will be revisiting again and again.
245,Kaliber,3.09,12 ounce bottle poured into a stemmed straight sided glass.  a decent alternative for when you need to limit your alcohol consumption. it is very malty it seems the lack of alcohol allows the malt sweetness to go unchecked and the taste less sharp and less dry than i would expect for a lager. it is reminiscent of some high malt lagers i’ve had kirin ichiban comes to mind. bready with corn aroma and flavor coming out as it warms. mouthfeel is light and clean but not crisp.  i is a compromise and i tried to keep that in mind while rating.
246,Kaliber,2.81,tried this for the first time despite reading a fred eckhardt column over a decade ago in which he said he enjoyed kaliber on his non-drinking day.  anyway decent looking tawny appearance. a small head sticks around throughout the experience. smells like grocery store brand wheat bread and a hint of stale apple juice. taste reminds me of some other guinness irish ales with a tangy sour-like acidity and brown bread underneath. near medium mouthfeel maybe a little more body than your domestic light beer.  overall not good but not half bad either. it doesnt stand up against the latest na creations from craft breweries but if your distributor only has a couple na options and youre on the look out its not the worst sixer you could scoop up.
247,Kaliber,3.78,am on a 6 week n/a period due to a medication and have tried 6 or so n/a beers so far. to me this has been by far the most drinkable. will keep this in my overall line-up for after my med is over especially as a hot weather thirst quencher.
248,Kaliber,2.7,(330 ml bottle l1326ggoo4 fl; purchased single off shelf... poured into a 14 oz mug)  l: polished-clear orange-tinged gold liquid; two-finger-high tight rocky foam stand... some lace; keeps a thin cap  s: a malt character ive yet to encounter almsot has sweet potato pie crust (or ginger snap?) baked and spiced notes... its not bready nor biscuity  t: the flavor is not much different... yuck awful... not beer like and especially not like other nas ive had... old wheat bread and apple cider?... quite dry with those apple crumb notes lingering  f: light-bodied buoyant without much drag and roundness but with just enough texture to give mild fulfillment; carbonation is soft  o: smell and taste alone this is arguably the worst na on the market... dont know how fresh this bottle is: nov 21?... cant they do better than this? ill give em this its unique (1915)
249,Kaliber,2.3,weird. drinkable but not good. tastes like a cider sort of.
250,Kaliber,1.21,first of all i can not imagine how any of the other ratings found the good things they said. especially the ones rating it as sweet. this garbage is sour and horrible. i believe it was spoiled it tasted so bad. i was afraid i was going to get sick. happily i awoke not sick so hopefully that possible danger has passed. it did have a sort of a weird smell that made me think i might be drinking something possibly sweet but once it hitmy tongue all that disappeared. the only thing impressive about this is that it would make a decent beer to serve for the purposes of a movie that required a bubbly drink with a thick head. it bubbles with a thick gooey foam that just lingers in a frightful manner given the horrible taste. after smelling and tasting this swill i began to wonder if the foam was part of some spoilage feature. i read reviews from the top in complete disbelief until i ran into 2 in 2011 that captured the essence of what i would like to say horrible. many na better.
251,Budweiser Select 55,1.95,12oz can  on the pour 1 finger of white head formed then quickly dissipated to your average aal head covering. body is a standard pale clear straw.  aroma is beer minus 90% of everything. some cheap funk but i guess the vagueness keeps it ok.ok.  taste is ultra watered down budweiser. not to the point of being a seltzer but its pretty close. there is a slight malty finish but thats about it.  feel is where the wateriness really comes through. seltzer like feel without the refreshment of water.  overall this is a dry malt flavored hard seltzer with 2.4% abv.
252,Budweiser Select 55,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included.
253,Budweiser Select 55,1.06,(this is an old review from 2005. i had it for the 99 cal bud select but it was this one)  as bad a brew as i\ve had from one of the major breweries....i thought this would be added flavor being it was select...it is not....it has little flavor and what flavor it does have is nasty...it literally tastes like i took a glass of water...dropped an ounce of bud light into and mixed it up...this has no redeeming qualities. i\d take a host of light beer over this that have more flavor....the worst purchase i have made in many years...stick to regular bud if you like ab macros..
254,Budweiser Select 55,1,drain-pour!
255,Budweiser Select 55,1,alright so this isnt a great beer. but make no mistake this isnt a good beer either.
256,Budweiser Select 55,1,if eberhard and adolphus rolled out of their grave this would be the first beer they destroyed. it\s been said before but i\ll say it again if you\re counting calories drink water or switch to vodka.
257,Budweiser Select 55,1.26,its thin flavorless and odd smelling. if youre that worried about carbs/calories drink water it tastes better. definitely not a beer lovers beer.
258,Budweiser Select 55,4.78,i like light beers and i’m watching calories. i realize a lot of people hated the taste but i was surprised that this tasted so good to me. light and crisp and i didn’t feel guilty drinking a couple. i don’t drink a lot so this works for me ! it’s is hard to find bottles and just a 6 pack because it wasn’t popular. i only find it in 24 cans which doesn’t work for me. bumper
259,Budweiser Select 55,2.1,12oz bottle - review from notes  just watered down bud lite basically. 2.4% abv makes me scratch my head in absolute bewilderment: who in tarnation is this beer for? near beer that isnt near beer  i just dont get it
260,Budweiser Select 55,1.25,possibly the worst beer i have ever had. the look is light and not very frothy. the taste is sour and actually made me feel on the queasy side. with only 2.4 abv meaning you would to drink twice as many to get to feeling good makes this beer an even poorer choice. sure it s lower in carbs and calories but give me a break. i d rather drink na beer because it tastes better.  needless to say i will never buy this beer again. to call it a lager is a travesty.
261,Budweiser Select 55,2.11,its light.
262,Budweiser Select 55,5,the beer has been unfairly rated and i wanted to clear things up. i’ve been on keto for a long time now. this is a low carb beer. it’s extremely watery. think...la croix: beer flavored. however if you like seltzer water beer and watching your calories and carbs...then this beer does it all. allows you to kick em back during the game with your buddies and not have to get out the carb calculator.  overall: highly recommended for those who are carb or calorie conscious. but yea it’s not gonna blow your mind with its hoppy flavor. i’m just happy there is an option out there like this!
263,Budweiser Select 55,3.63,by no means do i think this is a great beer ore even a good beer. what i like about this beer is that you can drink a case of them easily and wake feeling like you didnt drink (speaking from personal experience). some will love it but it wasnt anything special to me.
264,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,1.14,this is not a beer but this is whisky with beer i didnt enjoy it i think you drink beer to drink it and get after i while a good feeling not to bee stong drunk after just 1 beer so i do not recommend this
265,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.89,too robust for my stout arse
266,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.49,visited amsterdam; made a grocery store run and picked up a dozen random bottles. this was one and i didn\t even check the abv until halfway through (shortly after thinking good lord this is sweet).  it *is* sweet. cloyingly sweet. and sharp. and malty but otherwise bland and only slightly beery. interesting i guess but no ones version of a great beer.
267,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,3,30cl bottle. clear amber with a very thin white head. very sweet with notes of malt sugar boiled grains bitter hops and alcohol.
268,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.39,light orange with a quickly disappearing layer of foam which makes it look like a root beer within a few seconds. the smell is not that bad: fresh herby and yeasty. the taste however is: an unholy matrimony of sugar and booze with some malt. no attempt has been made to hide this guys huge abv. though it can be pretty refreshing despite its abv please skip this one. taste should always be priority number one.
269,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,1.24,served in a flute at 6*c appearance - standard lager colouration heavy co2 and rocky head that dies off instantly and leaves little lace.  smell - oddly chemical with grainy corn possibly.  taste - medical alcohol and a very off putting chemical element.  mouthfeel - watery and metallic.  overall - the drink-ability of this one is almost nil. drain pour unless you are a homeless park drinker!!! (i dont mean that to be as harsh as it sounds i do feel for people in that situation but still.... this is a beer i associate with homeless alcoholics not a good look or a good beer) my advice is avoid this one.
270,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,3.24,not bad for a strong lager very hard to find.
271,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.92,clear copper body with an average size beige head and good lacing. sweetness pokes through in the aroma along with the seasonal spices. caramel and dark fruit compete for attention. malt dominated taste. sweet but not cloying. molasses dark fruit orange peel and cinnamon all contribute with a hint of walnuts in the background. medium-to-full bodied moderately carbonated mouthfeel that lead to a lingering finish.
272,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.86,poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a a 12 oz. glass. nice amber color with a light brown short head that dissipates rather quickly leaving some nice lacing. i really dont get a lot smell from this beer but the flavor is rather complex and good to me. immediately i get carbonation with a mouth full then a toasted caramel finishing with nutmeg spice. overall very drinkable.
273,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.19,look: dark amber with a fluffy tan head.  smell: malt and spice. reminds me of a candle shop.  taste: a hit of carbonation up front. gentle malt that quickly fades into spice. finishes with spicy orange peel.  feel: maybe a little heavy on the carbonation.  overall: not my favorite spiced brew from the beers for cheers variety pack.
274,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.69,poured from a 12 oz bottle pulled from the holiday mix pack; no birth date. pours amber red with little to no foam head. slight taste of cinammon and other spices; decent coupling of malt on the back. a bit thin.
275,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.09,a once a year beer. doubt the popularity is there if this was out more often. great for christmas parties
276,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.28,imperial pint look: clear- dark amber pouring a minimal head with light lacing which dissipated to nothing smell: heavily toasted malt light baking spices strong sweet carmel and toffee notes taste: light bitterness leads to little sweetness caramel and dark chocolate and hint of clove. finish is smooth with heavily toasted malt and some cola-esk note feel: light-moderate body with gentle carbonation overall: its alright not my favorite of the lineup
277,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.53,l: deep ruby with a tan head that leaves a commendable amount of lacy. good looking beer s: spice with a hint of old sweatsocks. not a great smelling beer t: fortunately tastes much better than it smells. getting a lot of fruit and spice but not overly sweet in my opinion f: good carbonization. maybe a bit thin for the style o: good not great winter warmer. the relatively low abv (5.9%) for this style is a nice change of pace
278,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.74,look: pours a translucent shade of light brownish red with a one finger head of beige foam that leaves slightly below average amounts of lacing on the glass.  aroma: caramel and cherry mostly. some notes of smoky fire wood and candied plums.  taste: upfront its slightly acidic with notes of cherry before immediately turning sweet with savory flavors of candied toffee and caramel. midpalate some nice hints of cola and dark rum. finishes sweet with gentle notes of nutmeg and very mild ginger. the use of spices are well restrained and tempered here and not in your face or extremely assertive which i appreciate.  feel: sticky and sweet. somewhat syrupy but not overly so. body is medium weight and carbonation level is low. sugar level is moderately high imparting some weight to the beer.  overall: not a bad winter warmer but there are better beers out there in the style.
279,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.85,2022-dec-18  1.5 x 12 oz bottles glass: 0.5 l festmug abv: 5.9% temp: 55.1 f   look: dark but clear mahogany with ruby highlights. 2+ creamy beige head. the head lasted for a very long time leaving excellent lacing on the glass.  aroma: a plethora of deep but not dark malts. cherries and some other fruits; maybe stone fruits. spicy cinnamon nutmeg and allspice. some earthy notes. there is a sharpness that makes me think of ginger.  taste: very malty and somewhat sweet though not bready. toasted or burnt brown sugar/caramel. very noticeable cherry notes. the spices from the aroma are here along with some orange peel though they are not dominant. the sharpness becomes a mild earthy bitterness here.  feel: mostly clean but a tad syrupy. the body is medium-full.  overall: a solid and quite drinkable holiday ale.
280,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.01,12oz bottle  pours a finger of tan head into my nitro glass. retention is slightly below average and the head fades somewhat quickly. lacing is patchy but not too bad. body is a dark mahogany. looks ok.  nose is very sweet. malty and a little spicy with notes of stone fruit and cherry. smells pretty good but certainly has potential to be overly sweet.  flavor certainly has some stone fruit and cherry. quite malty. honestly this is pretty good.  carbonation is medium. body is pretty light. sweet but not overly so with a bit of tartness. bitterness is low but not void. a solid mouthfeel.  drinkability is great this is tasty and pretty well balanced.  overall a surprisingly good beer. can’t pick up the added spices but that’s probably a good thing.
281,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.22,its wonderful to pour the contents of two twelve ounce bottles into a clear glass liter mug and not be overwhelmed by stark white foam. instead theres a modest off-white head atop a bright and dark caramel colored brew. for all its color there remains a translucent quality as well. in short a fine looking beer. caramel malt and spices which seem to include allspice coriander and nutmeg provide the aroma. thankfully the malt and maybe an assist from molasses is the dominant taste with the spices augmenting rather than dominating the flavor. overall this is malty and sweet with a good caramel reference. while that may not be great press its so much better than the now overload of winter/holiday/christmas ales that merely overly spice a not so good brew. the glass lacing whilst not spectacular does bear witness to each serving. the body may not be outstanding as a a barley malt based brew but it far surpasses most beers that omit or drastically reduce it. its claim is that its rich and sweet and it is but not too much in either way.
282,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.36,super good seasonal offering. i wish this beer was available in a 6 pack instead of getting 2 in a winter 12 pack. i look forward every year to the fezziwig !
283,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.9,#184 so good!
284,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.52,putting a little pep in your step and numbing the senses all at once 3 floyds pink peppercorn and cinnamon dark lord variant takes this imperial stout to the nuclear level.... and with snacks.  jet black and pouring like ink chemtrailmix alerts the nose with a strong savory and sultry blend of coffee cocoa whisky spice port wine and sherry. as the inky elixir hits the tongue the taste is enlivened with the sweetness of brown sugar blackstrap molasses toffee honey and caramel with hints of chocolate and condensed fruit.  as the stout extends across the middle palate the sweetness slowly turns to dry. a rise of espresso bakers chocolate roasted nuttiness and campfire char keeps the session hefty before the spices of cinnamon and peppercorn tease the palate with a gentle dry prickle. trending warm with rye whisky and oak the late palate trends coconut-like with vanilla earthen grit and caramel with those savory aged port and sherry savory qualities.  full bodied pleasantly chewy and off-cloying chemtrailmix finishes malty-dry spicy and very warm. with impressions of sherry and coconut lingering in aftertaste this calls for a long patient and sipping session with high rewards and a surprising rate of drinkability if you can tolerate the combination of whisky and spice.
285,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.74,pours a pure coal black color with a sudsy dark tan head that is fairly quick to flee. the nose features the cinnamon up front and with extreme prejudice - this is bigly cinnamon. there’s also a nice spicy note from the peppercorn and some chocolate and a subtle barrel note.  the barrel is more pronounced on the taste and a perfect spicy complement to the peppercorn flavor - and the still bigly cinnamon which is delicious. there’s also chocolate and a surprising bit of stone fruit. there’s a lot going on here and it’s all magnificent imho.  the mouthfeel is velvety and coats the mouth properly commensurate with a beer of this magnitude. what a pleasure it is to finally experience this world class beer.
286,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.52,2020 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. heavy cinnamon on the nose and in the flavor with a mild spice. nicely thick. a little chocolate and barrel mixed in. happy to finally try this.
287,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.75,dig the cinnamon a lot with a unique peppery spice; supremely fudgy body that lingers; nice barrel too.
288,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.73,l. deep brownish black with a slight light brown head  s: sweet burnt sugar. almost a hint of molasses. heavy “cinamonny” like cinnamon toast crunch  t. ultra sweet up front but works and becomes balanced with the cinnamon. can’t really get the pepper tastes besides slightly on the tongue but know it’s there for the balance. finishes with a faint rye whiskey flavor.  f. viscous which coats the mouth. proper thickness  o. this beer is superb well balanced overall. much like a liquid cinnamon toast crunch and sweet cinnamon roll. couldn’t have more than one glass. extremely decadent
289,Icehouse Edge,1.75,the continued availability may be a local thing since i am in west virginias panhandle currently.  24oz can best by november 2023  on the pour a big 4 finger head formed then quickly receded. body is clear and yellow.  aroma is boozy and nearly all acetaldehyde green apple. nothing else.  taste at first follows the aroma but quickly mellows out with a full and corny almost warm maltiness. not too sweet for the style i guess.  feel is full verging on thick and has a slight warming sensation. long finish isnt terrible but it gets a bit intrusive like drinking a lot of whole milk but carbonated.  overall i have no idea why they reintroduced this. just drink stell reserve or regular icehouse depending on what youre going for.
290,Icehouse Edge,2.65,poured into a pilsner glass from a 24oz can. purchased in order to review before availability disappears.  look: lots of large bubbles. looks like a hive of bees.  smell: malty. smells boozy and strong. i think i can pick out some citrus and cracker.  taste: kinda wrong. its a little malty but wrapped in caramel. maybe even a nutty quality. sweet.  feel: its got the big boozy body that you would expect from a malt liquor.  overall: this one is definitely better suited for the colder months. its better than i remembered it being but still isnt great even by malt liquor standards. im a big fan of standard icehouse. this isnt it. they both share the same kind of maltyness but this one is heavy on the caremel.
291,Icehouse Edge,1.26,i\ve had regular icehouse before and i knew that was one of the worst beers out there. so being the masochist i am i thought to myself... how much worse could icehouse edge be? and here we are. at .99¢ for a 24oz tall can my butthole quivers as i gag and shudder with each sip questioning where my life went wrong. this is the obvious choice for a person lacking any moral compass which evidently there must be a staggering number of considering this stuff is stocked on the bottom shelf of gas stations from sea to shiny f#*@ing sea. thank you miller for not just lowering the bar but completely dropping it on the floor in the process.
292,Icehouse Edge,2.45,its a party beer. a cheap buzz. set your expectations low and buzzed is the way youll go. tastes bitter malty and cheap. smells like stains nutsack. but it gets you there.
293,Icehouse Edge,1.71,drank from the 24oz can. sickly sweet with a harsh medicinal finish. oddly thick and overcarbonated. this is easily one of the worst beers i have had the displeasure of trying.
294,Icehouse Edge,1.62,24 oz can poured into san adams pint glass.  look: best attribute. dark yellow straw colored. would never know the beer is awful from looking at it.  smell: here’s where things take a wrong turn. smell is sweet and very fruity. reminds me of the smell in a bottle return room at local grocery store.  taste: awful. very sweet. similar taste to a bottom of the tall plastic cup bud light served at a major league baseball stadium in 90 degree weather.  feel: the appearance of carbonation had me expecting a bubbly beer. instead has a flat feel to it.  overall: gets a 2 simply based on the 8% abv and not awful appearance. i’ve got 12 oz in the pint glass and rest of tall boy probably going in the sink.  edit: i did end up finishing the tall boy simply for the 8%. tasted terrible. review stands.
295,Icehouse Edge,2.74,yellow/gold pour with moderate head. scent is sweet mixed with malt and alcohol. taste follows with the alcohol kicking in at the end. light mouthfeel and a malty boozy aftertaste
296,Icehouse Edge,3.78,icehouse edge is a decent high gravity lager especially for the basement price of .99 per 24 oz. tallboy. about 48% higher in abv compared to more traditional lagers if one is wanting a buzz or to be intoxicated less beer is required (saving on carbs) and the taste is palatable.
297,Icehouse Edge,4.36,holds its own against the so called “ holy grail” malt liquor ‘steel reserve”. pretty smooth and cheap too. get it if you can find it.
298,Icehouse Edge,3.29,the first time i tried this i didn’t like it but if you drink more than one it will start to grow on you surprisingly. amazingly it has a nice mouth feel and a decent aftertaste. i can’t rate it more than a 3.25. it just gives you a nice buzz quickly but be careful it will make you sleepy. drink more than one and i promise it will grow on you and you will start to love it. one of my favorite beers now.
299,Icehouse Edge,2.3,pours a mild gold hue with a huge frothy head into my glass. metallic sweet corn in the nose with hardly anything else. ditto for taste. strong metallic overly sweet. unreal finish which tastes like corn flakes in a bowl of water. seriously there\s at least one other high gravity lager that you can waste your couch change on. it\s not this one.
300,Raspberry Tart,3.77,appearance: dark ruby good light pink head.  smell: raspberry and pretty strong tartness.  taste: tart and acidic with the raspberries in the background. mix of tart and raspberries in the finish. light bodied.  overall: the other mainstay fruit beer from new glarus raspberry tart follows its name and provides a tart raspberry experience. i would have preferred more raspberry and less tart but oh well. i prefer the belgian red.
301,Raspberry Tart,4.7,(12 oz bottle obtained at the brewery two days ago... poured into a clear plastic cup)  cloudy raspberry red liquid; some lasting foam in the form of a collar... redolent raspberry on the nose... raspberry pie on the palate fruit and dough; approaching fruit shrub in its acidity; mesmerizing dimension and expression of the raspberry flavor... the tart tingle invigorates my senses; its body has a lazy plushness to it almost but not quite nectary... an aptly named beer; this was my first time having it in about 9 years and i was in heaven; looking forward to sharing some with friends back home (2186)
302,Raspberry Tart,4.72,what do i say about one of the best beers of all time. its a shame that its only available in wisconsin but probably a good one for my body since it would be stocked all the time if i could get it
303,Raspberry Tart,4.44,i had stayed away from this beer thinking it would be really sour/tart. it is not. just enough tartness so that it is not overly sweet. will put this one on repeat buy list.
304,Raspberry Tart,4.28,poured from a bottle into a pint glass. pours deep red with an off white-red head. smells of raspberries very inviting. tastes of creamy raspberry nice and sweet yet nice and tart. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall a very good beer.
305,Raspberry Tart,4.7,poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a zwanze 2018 logo stemmed goblet because it seemed like the right thing to do. the color approximates a murky and slightly watered-down cola with a short snow-white head that left lots of spotty lacing. no question in my mind as to why this is among the top-rated beers of its style. its fruit forward with lovely aromas of raspberry jam balanced with notes of light breadiness. its sweet but not cloying. its tart but not overpowering. it has good carbonation and very low bitterness. it finishes perfectly dry. this made an ideal pairing with grilled chicken and i could imagine that it would be absolutely stellar with crackers and aged wisconsin cheddar. the only downside is that its available only in wisconsin but who doesnt like a nice road trip once in a while?
306,Raspberry Tart,3.56,very tart nice raspberry taste but i liked their cherry better
307,Raspberry Tart,4.15,this is very close to what i imagine a raspberry soft drink would taste like. its very sweet which in my opinion is the biggest downside but otherwise is an amazing beer. definitely more sweet than a typical fruit lambic or the belgian red.
308,Raspberry Tart,4.5,not too sweet. a well-balanced beer.
309,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.55,what was once an easy find is now one of the rarest treats in the brewing industry. this ale is the pinnacle of the spicy floral piney hop character that old school sierra nevada ipas exhibit. a deep burnt sugar crystal malt flavor balances the hop bite of this old school classic. no one makes beer like this anymore. i would take this over a tropical fruit bomb 9/10 times.
310,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.23,a: pours orange amber body with small white head with ok retention and lacing. s: slight malty and earthy hopness. t: earthy hop notes with a balanced sweet biscuity taste; slight vanilla aftertaste. m: medium bodied and slightly crisp and refreshing. o: nice feel and taste combo; pretty good overall..
311,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.43,it is a beautiful pour from a tap into a clear pint glass. dark copper-amber in color it also brings with it a modest and enduring light biege head. its mildly aromatic with solid earthy and malty notes. that also describes the flavor which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body. the hops add flavor without being overly bitter. this is truly a wet hopped ipa. earthy throughout the drinking experience even the finish doesn’t approach the expected ipa hoppy dryness. not that this lacks a good bitter hop inclusion its there just well balanced by a really good malt body.
312,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.76,look... brown brown brown copper and with ample carbonation and a white head. transparent smell...nonexistent light hop citrus with some maltiness taste...resinous  slick peppery but none of the kind of fresh hop experience that lagunitas has with their wet hop. good but for me very reminiscent of celebration in taste and color. feel...a carbonation that dictates the bitterness in the back end very nice. much lacing overall...this is a nice beer but get a lot of the same notes from celebration fresh hop and there are many sierra beverages i like a little more... they are a victim of all of their previous successes. its good why not try it!!!
313,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.25,i had this many years ago. i remember it being excellent. a great balance of hops and malt. one of the most well balanced ipas ive had.
314,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.75,355 ml bottle vintage 2015 in nevada city. amber to copper colour large white head. pleasant aroma of fresh hops herbal and fruity notes. the flavour is also well hopped throughout but the bitterness is not extreme for an ipa. a very decent and enjoyable beer.
315,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.19,sierra nevada came through with just what the beer dr. ordered for my jangled nerves. i wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many ipas on the scene here in the pnw. it has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like rueben’s but less marmalade. the sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness but it’s not too resinous thick but far from watery either. somehow this abv is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many ipas out maybe that’s a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds. this herbal/malt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so there’s another positive point. i did get this on tap so i’m not sure if i’d appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves. at this price it would be hard to pass if i was looking to purchase a pony keg for the man cave
316,Lone Star Beer,3,on my first ever trip to the lone star state of texas to see the tallica boys i decided to pick myself up a 6pk of 16oz lone star beers from the local kroger yee haw! i believe this hank hill style lager relies heavily on the texas gimmick and fair price to keep the cowboys coming back time and time again. not a beer i’d buy regularly if it was available to me all of the time but a must if i am ever back in texas.  style: lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 4.6% | rating: 3
317,Lone Star Beer,3.4,i must strongly disagree with who i call beer snobs or snooty. lone star is imho much more deserving of a better score. having said that here is my review.  l: amber/stray in color with lots of streaming bubbles. (im giving extra points for the bottle design) s: grains and grass maybe a faint whiff of cracker t: light and typical of an american lager. there is no mistaking that this is a beer f: watery and with a very faint pepper at the back of the throat o: much better than a lot of the weekend beers i have had in the past. i\d reach for a lonestar over bud or even bluemoon. my only complaint is that it is very difficult to get outside of texas and louisiana. luckily i have family in texas that send me some from time to time. not as good as shiner but still up there in my opinion
318,Lone Star Beer,2.17,it’s not great but it’s beer.
319,Lone Star Beer,3.31,12oz can poured into a nucleated pilsner glass. the appearance is clear medium gold with 4 fingers of white head. retention is average. strength of aroma is medium. the smell has biscuit a sweet corn adjunct smell but not as sweet as many adjunct beers a light hop smell and maybe a hint of a metallic smell. strength of taste is medium. taste follows aroma but drier. hop bitterness is light. feel is slightly above medium in thickness. carbonation and astringency are low. overall  being less sweet with slightly more thickness makes this better than many adjunct lagers.
320,Lone Star Beer,3.11,(12 oz bottle poured into a cold 14 oz shaker by the bartender at embassy tavern in denver last night... review copied from notes taken on my phone)  home fries? hash browns? corny grain must (referring to its aroma)... (palate) weird mix of corn tortilla and barley pancake... (feel) bitter pithy bite... (back to taste) slight touch of (the) hop(s)?... all 3.5 except 4.0 (for) feel  what i can add from memory: dont know what i was thinking but i gotta lower the marks for smell and taste as its initial aromas (and they eventually vaped off) were truly off-putting... aside from its introductory stench lone star is a pretty basic adjunct lager but on the lower end of its echelon... only a when-in-texas thing i guess (2031)
321,Lone Star Beer,3.35,drank from the can. date on can: dec 05 2022.  other reviewers have already summed up the vibe: clear yellow fizzy perhaps a bit darker than your typical american adjunct. aroma is sweet grains corn bread and yeast with a bitter grassy hoppiness. taste follows the nose well. very reminiscent of coors for me with a clean mouthfeel and solid flavor for the style with a bit more balance than most adjuncts which tend to be too sweet. i quite enjoy the body of this one its not as thin and ultra carbonated as a pabst blue ribbon actually has a tiny bit of chewiness.  figured i had to try this while im living in texas and it actually slightly exceeded my expectations. coors was my previously highest rated american adjunct macro and i think this one might slightly edge it out due to a better aroma but its very close. this isnt something i would pick up routinely unless i was in a monetary bind as it is priced quite modestly but it certainly gets the job done most especially on a hot summer day. my rating is based on style not on my personal preferences. you could definitely do worse in this category. cheers!
322,Lone Star Beer,4,this is just one of the beers from my past military service while i was stationed in the state of texas. it was our go to beer and back then was the beer to be drinking. i remember it as being great ... and its before the current beer craze.
323,Lone Star Beer,5,the national beer of texas. my go-to.
324,Lone Star Beer,3.97,appearance: pours a completely clear medium golden color iwht a bright white and soft head. srm of 6. (4.00)  aroma: moderate aromas of pale malts bread malts bread yeast and some corn adjuncts in the middle. yeast on the finish. (3.75)  flavor: moderate flavors of pale malts corn adjuncts in the middle. some bread and yeast. more adjuncts corn carbonation to finish.  feel: medium-bodied. stronger carbonation. a yeasty and full mouthfeel to finish.  compared to miller high life 6/16/22: pours a darker color stronger aromas. more yeast bready corn adjuncts. less smooth simple pale malt. less carbonation and sweeter.  compared to venice house lager 6/16/22: pours a darker or paler clearer appearance. more pale malt aromas less sweet biscuit. more clean pale malt. lighter and cleaner. simpler.  overall: this one exceeded my low expectations. nice pale bready malts and yeast here. bready yeasty full-bodied and maintains a nice bread flavor. im not sure why i expected less but this one dranks pretty well. ill seek it out again sometime for another review (rating: 3.97)
325,Lone Star Beer,3.02,looks like a beer tastes like a beer… just not a very good one. like in between a classic budweiser and a busch light.
326,Molson Canadian 67,1,are you kidding me!? absolutely the worst ‘beer’ i’ve ever tried!. a neighbor / friend bought a 4 pack of 16oz cans and invited me over to try one. slightly amber colored on the pour. no head no taste no nuttin!! glad i didn’t buy it!! wouldn’t even make a decent drain cleaner!
327,Molson Canadian 67,2.59,ok we get it. it’s not heady topper. it’s not an illustrious ipa not is it even regular molson canadian. we get it. that being said our neighbors to the north crafted a very good low-calorie option for when you want to crank brews and not worry about your waistline. molson 67 still holds that classic canadian lager tast with a third of the calories. while that is something we at the 1009 are hardly worried about when grading this category its hard to avoid. unfortunately this is a dying breed. molson phased out 67 almost a year ago for “molson ultra”. so we grabbed this while we could. so long 67 you had a good run.
328,Molson Canadian 67,1.1,it tastes like if you left bread in a perrier overnight
329,Molson Canadian 67,1,terrible.
330,Molson Canadian 67,2.23,355 ml bottle served cold into a pint glass. leftovers from a party a couple of weeks ago.  apperance- clear rather play golden colour. small half finger of white head with better retention than expected. even a trace amount of lace.  smell - weak grainy aroma with some corn notes. metallic and slightly vegetative undertones. nothing offensive.  taste - a faint flavour of beer but mostly like beer flavoured tonic water or club soda. nothing horribly offensive.  mouthfeel - feels way over carbonated body is super light but these two factors dont go too well together.  overall - worse beers exist and as a low carb option for people who dont like beer this may be viable. still of youre drinking a beer this light isnt water a better option?
331,Molson Canadian 67,1.83,appearance - poured from a 473 ml can into a pint glass poured a very light clear straw color with 3 fingers foamy head that died fast. carbonation looks lively enough. does it look like the style? yes...  aroma - corn and water. mostly water...  taste - spring water with corn in the background...  feel - extremely light watery body with prickly carbonation...  overall - might as well just drink a molson caanadian original... from what a remember the taste was tenfold better.
332,Molson Canadian 67,1.75,
333,Molson Canadian 67,1.78,molson canadian sixty seven. the look of it is very light and its yellow. smell of hop and of corn. remind me of the coors light it the molson canadian. the smell of it. nothing too different from the canadian. very similar. now the taste of it: well nothing to different than a molson canadian a bit lighter. a bit if a different taste to it. its a bit plastic taste to it. so overall would i recommend it ?? for man no for women maybe. if you know what beer taste like dont drink that crap. but for women who likes to drink beer but wanna drink low alcohol percentage and wanna have low calories this beer is made for u.
334,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.91,anchorage brewing’s a deal with the devil double oak-aged barleywine is an extraordinary beer that left a lasting impression on my taste buds. the combination of its rich double oak aging and complex flavors creates a truly remarkable experience. the aroma greets you with notes of caramel vanilla and subtle hints of bourbon setting the stage for what’s to come.  the taste is where this beer truly shines. the double oak aging process imparts a smoothness that is both velvety and warming. it boasts a perfect balance of malty sweetness dark fruit flavors and a delicate touch of oak and bourbon. as it warms up the complexities further unfold revealing layers of complexity that keep you intrigued throughout each sip.  the mouthfeel is luxurious and full-bodied showcasing the craftsmanship behind this beer. the finish is long-lasting leaving a pleasant aftertaste that beckons you to take another sip.  while this is certainly not an everyday beer due to its higher abv it is undeniably a treat worth savoring on special occasions or for those seeking an indulgent experience. its bold flavors and well-crafted profile make it a standout among barrel-aged beers.  whether you’re an avid beer enthusiast or simply looking to try something exceptional anchorage brewing’s a deal with the devil double oak is undoubtedly a top-tier choice that i highly recommend. cheers!
335,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.75,2017 vintage. dark brown black with oily appearance and a light brown bubbly collar of head. bourbon oak+ butterscotch dates mild chocolate. thick mouthfeel and smooth light carbonation. whale of a barleywine!
336,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.47,2023-06-13 shared this with @fbarber in a holiday inn lobby on a tuesday night. served in plastic cups.  this was delicious monstrous and sweet tons of vanilla and toffee. thick and satisfying.
337,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.71,absolutely delicious english barleywine. very much on the sweet side its got lots of candied fruit oak and lots of barrel. surprisingly thick syrupy mouthfeel. a truly stunning beer.
338,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.54,thick sweet big barrel flavors but smooth with no sign of hop burn. light carbonation that matches the style well. caramel and toffee oak and rich bourbon
339,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.26,*batch 5*  pours the deepest of dark browns no head. bourbon and leather on the nose masking some almond and perhaps also some dried fruit. my partner says twizzlers and i can see that too. under the omnipresence of bourbon i get raisin brown sugar then cola and fig on the finish. this is good albeit a little sweet which does make it hard to get to completion if you are drinking this on its own which if you spent a lot of money on the bottle you are probably feeling this way. anyway its a good beer and barleywine. i think the barrel character the oak couldve been more rugged but it has plenty of boozy character.
340,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.7,pours a rich mahogany with red edges. head is reluctant but slowly emerges with tight tan bubbles almost like it’s nitro’d.  quiet nose still dominated by alcohol heat even after 6 years of aging. pull your nose back from the glass and you’re met with subtle vanilla coconut and stewed dark fruits.  flavors are massive and immediately hit you with boozy oaky tannic cognac bite. it evolves into dark caramel toffee bitter pecan figs and vanilla. just a huge barrel influence with flawless blending to keep things in balanced. sweetness is perfectly in check and you’d never know it’s 17%.  mouthfeel is impossibly smooth with absolutely no alcohol burn. it’s perfect.  perfect birthday beer. exactly the type of thing i love. huge barrel character tempered sweetness tons of oaky vanilla. this beer laughs at 6 years of aging.. it could last 60.
341,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.54,2022 vintage  ive finally arrived at the illustrious a deal with the devil series. i have not had the base beer but i recently came across this and the triple oak-aged version. considering this is review #1599 for me i wonder what ill choose for the milestone review #1600...lets get into it  pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing but with fantastic legs  the nose here is very sweet but in no way overbearing with much of the sweetness coming from dark fruit notes. i’m picking up on aromas of fig dark chocolate sweet bourbon vanilla black cherry burnt caramel charred oak cognac molasses light port wine and toasted walnut  it keeps up the sweetness and the balance of said sweetness in taste despite some seriously boozy notes that come through and somehow improves upon it. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting molasses sweet bourbon brown sugar raisin toasted oak vanilla smoky tobacco sticky caramel light coconut plum and a touch of port wine. the swallow brings notes of black cherry plum port wine burnt caramel cocoa powder raisin sweet vanilla charred oak earthy bourbon walnut and the slightest hint of fusel alcohol  a medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a slick and boozy beer. finishes mostly dry and seriously complex and the booze actually works really well here for a perfect mouthfeel  this is awesome. im not sure its worth what it sells for but who cares? it was great to get to try this nonetheless. with the second highest rated american barleywine behind me we all know whats next
342,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.3,this was supposed to be a legendary barley wine. it was also a very expensive barley wine. maybe my palate is not developed enough to tell the difference between this and other ba barley wines. look: typical caramel color smell: toffee dark fruit taste: follows he nose feel: medium body overall: i gave it an overall rating of 4 due to the price. i just cant justify $100 for a 12 ounce bottle. one and done for me not worth the price.
343,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.58,sweet caramel/molasses/toffee bits hint of dark fruity raisins and a balanced bourbon barrel boozy nose on this one! nice aromatics here! taste follows with a dark fruity caramel malty and bourbon barrel swallow. nose>taste imo and although this is delicious either there is just a hint of age is showing on the backend or other breweries are catching up to the high standard that anchorage has set with barleywines. good stuff!
344,Dreadnaught,4.01,i dig it but a little too bitter. and i’m a little too bitter.
345,Dreadnaught,4.17,i remember once upon a time when this was the highest rated double ipa on beeradvocate and i could not get it in my area. much time has passed and i am really grateful i can now get this beer where i live. 16 ounce can 3/17/2023 born on date; i imagine this would be even more impressive when sampled closer to the born on date but its still a pretty fresh sample. fruit flavors are pineapple and peach. alcohol is very well concealed. this is a sweet and juicy sample of the style. i prefer crisper versions but if i see this on tap im going for it.
346,Dreadnaught,4.65,best ipa ive had yet...
347,Dreadnaught,4.42,poured into a seattle beer week pint glass. pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger white head with great retention and solid lacing looks nice. aroma of biscuit malt citrus hops lemon orange grapefruit and some dankness. flavor is biscuit and light dry caramel malt citrus and piney hops grapefruit orange pine mild mixed tropical fruit a little rye; resinous pine and citrus rind finish with great alpha oil bitterness. medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. glad to finally try something from this venerable brewery and im glad i started with this. getting an ipa from the midwest that has substantial bitterness is a joy in this hazy age and this is one solid ipa. the malt is somewhat old fashioned with good biscuit notes but the hops are classic nw ipa which is my favorite profile. lots going on here and quite enjoyable. this ipa has been off my radar im going to try to snag a gumball head next one of my favorite ale names. looks smells and tastes great.
348,Dreadnaught,4.35,pours out of the can a gently hazy deep copper with a nice two finger white head and great retention. laaaazy bubbles up the side of the glass. smells piney resinous and like ripe citrus. tastes leans heavier on the pine and resin and hits you a bit with the alcohol. i think on the third sip i was starting to find the malt notes that are advertised on the can. if im honest its really well done but the alcohol is a tad bit distracting from the overall flavor but not enough to bring its score down too bad. its a robust mouthfeel and is carbonated expertly. glad i got to try this old school imperial that ive heard was a game changer years ago.
349,Dreadnaught,4.43,from a tap delivered inside a clear pint glass it came. its beautifully and brightly copper-amber with a very modest off-white head. the aroma although not pronounced brings ipa hops and malt. theres a little too much alcohol to taste to keep it from excellence but the abv is 9.4 for goodness sake. the malt body is rich and up to carrying the hops and most of the alcohol. as it should be the hops both citrusy and earthy dominate the outstanding taste.
350,Dreadnaught,4.5,special stuff from a special outfit. l: from the canon mccann is very stylish and somewhat psychedelic. s: big citrus hoppy aroma. simply delicious. t: just awesome and special. the bitterness is almost overwhelming at times. all kinds of happy goodness flavors lotta citrus pine. f: smooth and rich. o: this is a terrific beer and i’m always thrilled when i find it.
351,Dreadnaught,4.38,deep orange with chill haze big white head excellent retention thick rings of lace musky tropical fruit some pine sweet citrus a bit of dank hints of rich caramelly malt aroma sweeter than id like lots of rich caramelly malt citrus especially grapefruit and orange some pineapple and mango flavors. hints of pine medium-heavy bodied with appropriate carbonation slightly cloying heavy syrupy bodied keeps this from being drinkable but otherwise exemplary
352,Dreadnaught,3.79,16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $4.89. canned on 3/17/23 so this is five weeks and a day old.  look: it pours out a very nice light orange amber color with very tiny floaties. the two fingers of rocky beige-colored head slowly dissipated. looks like a nice imperial ipa.  smell: it smells super piney along with a bit of citrus notes. i get orange peel and some pepper. theres also some sweet malt notes and some boozy bubble gum notes. for a beer that is this big the nose is underwhelming.  taste: this is a huge imperial ipa. at 9.4% abv it really does not taste nearly as strong as it is. its dangerously drinkable and its actually somewhat balanced. up front its malty and sweet for a very short time before the hop bitterness takes over. the finish is very bitter and earthy with huge pine notes and grapefruit peel and it lingers super long. eventually orange peel and caramel/crystal notes come forward after the bitter hop resins fade from the front of the palate. after pouring the bottom of the can the body improved a bit but the taste also became slightly chalkier.  feel: its medium plus bodied with a nice chewy slick and slightly oily mouthfeel.  overall: this is definitely a solid imperial ipa. i can appreciate this beer but it\s not really my personal preference to go seeking this out again. i may have had it many years ago via beer trade but at that time i was just looking to seek out the big beers that were highly rated and i may not have even had an imperial ipa before so it was worth trying again.  from the can: an imperial india pale ale with an intense citrus hop aroma a huge malt body and a crisp finish.
353,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,4.8,both 2014 and 2020 have been some of the best bt variants.
354,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,5,my favorite go to beer.
355,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.3,well they basically watered down the old boston lager which didn\t need any remastering in the first place. it tastes like the old version except less of everything: not as malty not as hoppy less of a cinnamon note.... just less. i rate it compared to the old version so it\s rated a lot less. they are obviously dumbing it down for the light beer drinker which is a pathetic thing to do.
356,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.69,sam adams boston lager new version draft at a restaurant dinner in august 2023. overall a good beer with dinner. this is the newer version of sam adams. it has a good head and lacing; the body is a healthy amber. flavor has a hint of roasted malt. the aftertaste has a minor pleasant bitterness. i can\t directly compare to the old sam. from memory the new one is more to my taste with a smoother flavor.
357,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.69,this is the remastered version. drinking on the national day of massachusetts in my home state of massachusetts.  12 oz can acclimated to 46°f and poured into a pilsner glass.  pours a somewhat hazy medium amber color with a 2.5 finger long lasting foamy white head leaving medium lacing.  initial aroma is heavy on malt and yeast some spicy phenols coming out. after agitating the year dominates the foreground with maybe a slightly caramely quality found hiding behind?  initial taste before swallowing is a little bland yeasty with a definite dry floral spice. after swallowing im met with a mild hop and malt bitterness slightly soapy and not dry. malt is not just bitter presenting caramely and very bready. some grainy taste to it.  mouthfeel is frothy due in what i suspect is in large part due to the satisfying carbonation. additionally a little choppy or rough but not at all bad its a lager and it feels like one.  overall its a solid beer not trying to be anything its not. excellent if you want just a lager  likely to buy for the national day of boston and massachusetts once a year but not otherwise i dont remember how much a single was but i doubt it was cheap enough to make me reconsider. sorry sam adams.
358,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.27,its unfortunate that they felt the need to change this beer as i found it nicely refreshing before. is it more refreshing now? maybe but i dont think it tastes as good. there is a lack of the expected caramel notes and its a bit too high on the hops and carb for me. still better than aot of macro options though.
359,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.32,anytime you set a standard you are entitled to change that standard. boston lager wants to compete in a bigger market and tweaked their formula. that didn’t immediately make it a terrible beer. it’s a little more hoppy a tad sweeter a little more approachable. if my airport restaurant choices are bud light or boston lager.. well..
360,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.72,boston lager was the beer that made me actually appreciate my drink. before that i would drink anything but once i tasted boston lager something was different and wonderful. now it\s remastered and it\s absolutely ruined... it\s still better than some i\m sure but i won\t be buying any more.
361,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,2.74,wow. i know todd is old enough to be familiar with the new coke debacle. no need to say anything else. after well over 30 years of drinking and touting sam adams lager im finished. very disappointing. especially since current craze for hops will be a relatively short-lived trend. incidentally best sa beer for my money was boston ale on tap.
362,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3,epic fail. i miss the caramel notes and the tettnanger(?) hops that typified this beer. wont be purchasing this in the future
363,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.12,why destroy this beer? i understand that at 50 i am no longer in the hip demographic but i came to know better beer in my youth through this beverage. bearded chubby 35 year old dudes that wear their t- shirts a size to small have plenty of options. you could have left one for the rest…tastes like a hoppy yuengling.
364,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.8,about 35 years ago sa was my first experience with a “craft beer” after years of drinking michelob and national i’m hi is aaron available for sean? i have a question to you is sean davies still here and he is still there is he available? that would be great. i’ll take sean thank you bye-bye show me the other guy is premium. i really loved sa for many years but moved on to true craft brews. last week at a family get together they offered sa. i was anxious to taste this again but was shocked at what swill this had become. the beer looked thin and tasted of cereal grains. thought i had time traveled back to michelob days. really hope they don’t completely destroy dogfish head.
365,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.5,i haven’t had the non nerfed version of samuel adam boston lager since around 2008. so it’s hard for me to compare the original with the “cost cutting” opps i meant “remastered” version. but it tastes mostly like i remembered maybe a bit more watery now though. it’s a mighty fine beer that i’ve kind of been craving more of lately. i just wish since it’s now beer flavored seltzer water that they’d slash the price a tad bit.  style: vienna lager | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 5% | rating: 3.5
366,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3,this is like the new coke or the star wars specialized edition all over again. why in the world would you mess with the original recipe that is the flagship for your brand? the remastered sam adams is ok i dont hate it but i definitely preferred the original. if you want to come out with a new flavor then come out with a new flavor. leave the original as is.  with that said the remastered version is dryer a bit hoppier less sweet and less malty. the carbonation is about the same the mouthfeel is a bit thinner.  i probably wont be buying the new sam adams anymore as there are superior options available.
367,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,2.31,the remaster should be demastered. the rich creamy amber of old has been replaced with a more bitter and dry lite esb. i’m halfway through my 1st 12 pack. wondering if i can make it to the end…..  update: solution- add lime.
368,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.66,why change a great beer? it now tastes like an ipa. i poured the last half out. i signed up for this site just to leave a review.
369,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,3.76,maybe a bad batch but the flavors were super muted and didnt pop like a normal trill beer.
370,Parabajava,4.69,2022 vintage drank 08/31/23 pours a jet black with little carbonation. strong aroma of morning coffee with chocolate syrup. palate is choc covered espresso beans soaked in bourbon barrels. great mouthfeel with a gentle sweetness that’s not overpowering and very smooth given the abv. absolutely perfect and easily the best ba coffee stout i’ve had.
371,Parabajava,4.51,received as a gift from a kind friend - poured from a crowler (filled on 7/31/23 - enjoyed on 8/20/23) into a snifter.  clear seal brown liquid rests beneath a beige crust receding to a thin ring and surface slick. gentle lacing; slick thin sheen of tears.  chocolate fine tobacco molasses black licorice cherry pits black coffee and brown sugar in the nose - stupendous.  boozy oaky toasty lightly charred with perhaps even more flavor (following the nose) in the finish than on the palate. wave after wave of malt and barrel complexity. bittersweet and almost but never quite smokey/spicy. mild bitterness throughout earthy/woodsy medium-dry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon.  slippery almost oily mouth-feel with some residual tannins.  forgot how good the base beer can be and the coffee adds another layer of roast/fruit/bitterness without distracting from the character of the stout. wonderful example of the style.
372,Parabajava,4.45,12 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition had 4/13/23.  pours a mostly opaque dark brown with a half inch foamy head and some foamy lacing. aromas of coffee bourbon roasted malt chocolate oak some char and cocoa a hint of cherry. flavors of intense coffee roasted malt bourbon chocolate oak. smooth a solid full body appropriately carbonated.  the coffee is prominent bold and outstanding. the barrels show well the base is solid the feel is great. will buy this anytime it is available.
373,Parabajava,4.49,2022 vintage  when i first tride og parabola i quite enjoyed it but honestly had higher expectations. and i think coffee would improve upon the base beer so i’m hopeful for this one. let’s crack open this legendary variant of a legendary beer and see what it’s all about  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of frothy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  it’s definitely punchy in the nose somewhere between roasty and bitter white still presenting a nice sweetness. i’m picking up on aromas of cacao nib earthy hops roasted espresso molasses burnt toast toasted oak vanilla light brown sugar and tobacco  it trends much more bitter in taste but that underlying sweetness helps things from getting out of hand. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting molasses earthy hops cacao nib dark roast coffee plum rye toast burnt caramel light vanilla and brown sugar. the swallow brings notes of cacao nib dark roast coffee burnt toast toasted oak black cherry caramel earthy hops light plum and molasses  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer. finishes dry and roasty  yeah this is definitely better than the original the coffee is just the kick it needs. maybe i’ll get to try some other variants some day
374,Parabajava,4.37,look - love the thick blackness with a nice thick tan head great rimming and lacing smell -roasted malt and coffee barrel slight dark fruit taste -roasted malt coffee dark chocolate barrel slightly bitter feel -creamy full body light carb overall - pretty great
375,Parabajava,4.13,aroma is boozy bourbon with a bit of classic chocolaty stout -- jammy molasses and plum. body is strong with bourbon followed shortly by roasty coffee and the two combine to make something like a mounds bar with a swig of strong black coffee. one of the best examples of a good barrel aged stout out there.
376,Parabajava,5,04/27/23 bottle @ home
377,Parabajava,4.52,pitch black pour with a full brown head. the nose is great: espresso added to usual parabola but the barrel not cut at all. taste is coffee and chocolate forward barrel is rustic roasted malt parabola base is still great. body is a touch thinner but still earthy rustic and boozy with roast. this is well done but i like the original best still
378,Parabajava,4.25,2022 version poured cellar temp to a mug. base parabola has always been excellent. this coffee version is good with a new profile to the base. gone is the bright complex woody bourbon up front. that has been replaced with a milder more chocolate front. the middle is “parabola” in body and flavor. the coffee comes into play as a mouthfeel factor and an end-sip lingering dirty cup of joe. it’s a decent coffee flavor. it’s slightly odd to me that it comes into focus so late in the flavor. no alcohol burn and really not much warming as one might expect from this big abv bomb. for my money i’d stick with base parabola or the anniversary offerings.
379,Parabajava,4.58,i has this once years ago… 2016 or 2017 in a 22oz bomber split with a friend but haven’t had it since. glad to finally revisit. this is a 2022 vintage poured from a 12oz bottle into a tg md snifter. pours light brown but gathers in the glass a shiny dark brown to almost black with a thin mocha brown foam cap that settles into a thin collar around the rim of the glass. bourbon barrel and coffee on the nose for a beautiful mix of aromas plus some chocolate from the base stout and oak. taste follows and to me is even better than the nose. the coffee is present but there’s still tons of barrel and i get a lot of good rich chocolate notes from the base beer. medium-full mouthfeel bordering on full but it’s just a touch too carbonated for me. it’s still very sticky and mouth-coating and one could argue the carbonation makes it a little easier drinking. incredible barrel-aged imperial coffee stout!
380,Parabajava,4.59,poured at fridge temp. pours jet black with a thin (half inch) layer of light brown head. tiny bubbles rising throughout the glass. the nose is fantastic. intense coffee but a really nice coffee smell. not cheap stale coffee grounds. this is a fresh coffee smell. i roast my own beans and this is like dipping my nose in the beans a few hours after roasting. lovely. other smells of chocolate vanilla toffee malts burnt wood and some brown sugar.  the taste is absolutely insane. one of the best tastes from a coffee stout. again the coffee is front and center. a lovely fresh coffee taste. not overly bitter at all. dark chocolate vanilla marmalade brown sugar a touch of maple walnuts and salted caramel. the barrel comes through here for sure but definitely complimentary rather than dominant.  the mouthfeel is thick and robust. the alcohol is there on the swallow but definitely doesnt drink like its 13.8% abv! overall one of the best coffee stouts i have ever had.
381,Parabajava,4.79,l: dark jet black poured on draft into a 3oz sampler. not a ounce of light can be seen aside from looking at the very top. looks not to heavy not to thin somewhere in the middle. s: heavy toasty coffee notes on the inside. dark chocolate followed by it can’t smell the bourbon at all in this one. t: dark rich malts on the sweeter side big coffee here mixed in with chocolate. not getting much cherry in this one as it’s very covered by the malty coffee chocolatiness. getting some molasses the dark cherry comes more in the after taste the more i sip and let it sit. f: medium to heavy bodied tastes are on the thicker side - oily. o: this actually was an amazing beer. probably the best i’ve tried by firestone walker by far.
382,Parabajava,4.75,just scored a little stash of the 2022 release. cap released without a hiss (despite a few days being jostled in the fedex truck and handoffs). pour issued a slight capper which receded into a persistent gurgly ring at the fill line. nose is of coffee right at the forefront some nuances that might have me recalling oatmeal stouts (or caramel corn); no noticeable barrel burn. taste is coffee-bitter sweet tangy a titch of grapefruit-y hoppiness (should i gargle it?). swallow is of strong bitter coffee caramel sweetness some ticklish carbonation slight barrel presence.  a very fine sample! ill be dispensing the remaining vessels most judiciously...
383,I.C. Light,3.05,on tap: pretty decent for a light adjunct lager. clear yellow gold with a solid white cap that fades to a small bubble ring without lacing - pretty standard. nose is barely enough to make me feel it won’t be too sweet despite faint corn being about all i can pick out. turns out the nose was right - a balanced beer without a lot to it but just enough to be refreshing and a tad dry.
384,I.C. Light,5,best tasting light beer i have ever had! nice light beer taste and very refreshing on a hot summer day without the calories or alcohol.
385,I.C. Light,2.91,ok my score is skewed a bit because i consumed this beer at a penguins hockey game. the can it was served in was a bright yellow and celebrated pittsburgh sports championships. drank it during the first period. this beer is what it is. it is refreshing and easy to drink but it lacks much in the way of smell and taste. anyway had a great time drinking it with my nachos. wish the pens had won!
386,I.C. Light,3.81,(12 oz can 0542 2017; purchased single off shelf at shangys yesterday... poured into a 14 oz mug)  l: polished-clear extra-pale gold liquid with a faint cloud of speckled sediment; curiously gloriously snow drifty foam like whipped egg white... keeps a collar; big ring of lace at the top - what?!  s: herbal earthy overtone; popcorn trails around the perimeter with a vaguely poundcakey interior which sort of also comes across as cornbread  t: semi corn-colored dry grainy foundation... maybe the slightest hint of sulfur... bold but bland no-frills pils malt in the aftertaste accented by some grassy and mildly spicy hops and maybe a slight residual soapy note  f: light-bodied snappy and subtly sharp... lively carbonation with a bite up front as well as a soft round swell before it finishes relatively level and dry; delicate spicy hop/alc warmth  o: eww was this a 2017 can?!... never got around to trying this when in pittsburgh last august; this was my first chance... its a bit aggressive for a light beer but i could get down with it (1961)
387,I.C. Light,2.24,24oz can into a pint glass. freshness dating unclear.  pale watery golden body with light carbonation. head quickly fizzes away no lacing.  there is hardly any aroma. a little malt if i try hard.  on tasting well hardly any taste. bland thin light.  mouth closer to thin than medium finish a little off as well.  overall pretty poor beer. nothing to it. may as well drink water if you care about carbs and calories. most of this is heading for the drain.
388,I.C. Light,1,a homeless guy we gave a case too refused to drink it.
389,I.C. Light,2.18,tastes like weird promiscuous wood.
390,Imperial Coffee And Cigarettes,4.6,appearance - the beer was black in appearance with an off-white head crowning the glass.  smell - i was surprised by the sweetness in the nose. they were definite notes of coffee and smoke.  taste - to me the profile was like a milk stout more than a porter. the coffee profile was sweet but there was a definite presence of smoke. not to sound too negative but it was like a cup of coffee and a smokey diner. except it was good. the finish was sweet but the acidity of the smoke lingered.  mouthfeel - low carbonation and the creamy feel made this seem like a milk stout.  overall - this was a phenomenal beer and i am grateful for the opportunity to try it.
391,Imperial Coffee And Cigarettes,4.36,fresh can from cellarmaker. as expected coffee chocolate burnt tobacco. medium full mouthfeel. overall: good version of original. just a bit more oompf.
392,Imperial Coffee And Cigarettes,4.24,another beer put down at march madness 2018 courtesy of sheldon and his cellarmaker is the greatest brewery in the world lulz.  pours that place where its black but not black black like black dark brown. compact small bubble head that is a lighter shade of brown compared to the liquid. aroma is just some ass beating coffee. if you were looking for a smoke bomb here its not really here the coffee is just pushing hefty weight.  taste takes the smell and starts to add more nuance and complexity beyond the hotboxing of coffee. now there is roasted grain and a lighter smoke quotient. hides the alcohol pretty amazingly well. carbonation was fine. bitterness largely tempered by everything else going on.  normally i would like the regular version of something more than the imperial but this one appears to be the exception to the rule. didnt really lose anything but gained some strength you cant taste but has more of a smoky interior than it does ashy which separates it slightly from the also very good regular strength coffee & cigarettes. cant go wrong with either one.
393,Imperial Coffee And Cigarettes,4.54,two week old can into an imperial nonic pint.  nearly black opaque brown with 2+ fingers of tan medium density head with great retention and mixed lacing.  nose is great coffee forward and dark chocolate in tow. some smokiness shows as it warms.  taste follows the nose well with added smokiness kinda surprised at the sweetness level. finishes with moderate bitterness that lingers a bit.  medium bodied with moderate carbonation full on the tongue and silky on the swallow.  outstanding beer for my palate and preferences (love coffee beers). will grab it any chance i get.
394,Imperial Coffee And Cigarettes,4.54,the smoke is light and complimentary.... nose is huge roasty coffee backed up by the taste --yet it doesnt overwhelm everything here is balanced. drinking this from a can (first time canned just a couple days ago). even if its your first beer of the day it tastes like the end of a long happy drinking session out and about.
395,Imperial Coffee And Cigarettes,4.55,candid confession. like every other self-conscious asian-american trying to fit in in college i chain smoked cigarettes during my freshman and sophomore years. and then i discovered the joy of running half and full-marathons and quit for a while until time came for my masters thesis when i pretty much subsisted off diet red bull and mild seven super lights for days at a time.  i haven\t picked up a cigarette for over eight years now but i still some times miss that soothing smell of filtered tobacco slowly cooking over a gas-propelled fire; in fact even as a kid i got scolded by my parents because i had an odd penchant for lighting put-out cigarettes and cigarette butts because i apparently wanted the room to smell like mugicha.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ tobacco-inspired personal anecdotes aside coffee and cigarettes pretty much delivers everything it promises and more with the exception of the 11 vignettes that the namesake movie is composed of. the primary olfactory sensation at lower temperatures more closely resembles a breakfast stout than a smoked porter: a rich amalgamation of double chocolate cwofee\n\creme (be sure to read coffee with a brooklyn accent) milled grains and a touch of cardamom beckons the senses. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ the more you let this beer warm up the more accurate it synchronizes with its name--the smoked malts progressively take over the olfactory profile starting off as slightly burnt bacon; then it upscales itself to hickory chips and soon before long it reaches its final form of extra skinny virginia slims that all the キャバ嬢 in akasaka smoke. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ whereas the aromatic experience is somewhat portable to the palate you dont experience quite the same up and down as you do on the nose. the main impression that the brew puts out to the tongue is as youd expect from an imperial porter: strong dark roast coffee black licorice and molasses provide the overall palatal backdrop to the brew. just like it was on the nose however the cigarette factor becomes more evident and intensifies over time; give the brew some time to warm up and there\s a soothing rauchbier-esque smokey goodness that develops and lingers on your tongue; only difference is that this doesn\t have that odd savory/salty aftertaste that a lot of commercial rauchbier examples seem to carry with them. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ medium-bodied with a creamy initial mouthfeel. ambient but substantial carbonation despite the deceptively still apperance; the leaves behind a nice sticky sensation on the lips with each sip. if responsible adults that followed reasonable societal norms were permitted to drink 22oz of 10.5% abv beers for breakfast everyday this would be my poison of choice.
396,Imperial Coffee And Cigarettes,4.08,crowler: poured a pitch-black color porter with a huge dark brown foamy head. aroma of dry bitter roasted malt with huge black chocolate notes light smoke/tobacco notes is pretty intense. taste is an intense mix of sweet black chocolate notes with dry bitter roasted malt notes with light smoked and some tobacco notes are also perceptible. body is full with good carbonation with not overwhelming notes of alcohol that are perceptible. intense and a beer that his better shared but glad i tried it.

398,Yacht,3.84,for my next entry in new more odds n sods beer sunday (week 780) i am returning to the delmarva (+ dc) debacle & my old friend stillwater. i still have a number of duclaw & some keys before i totally close the book but i was starting to get bogged down to the point of taking a break. this seems like a nice add to the canquest (tm) while helping to reduce the backlog.  from the can: dry-hopped session lager;  ;7 contemporary works by stillwater  works for me! i crack!ed open the vent & becan a slow gentle c-line glug into the awaiting glass. man did this one ever want to foam up! i wound up with two-plus fingers of dense foamy rocky bone-white head with great retention. color was a gorgeous yellow-gold (srm = 4 - 5) with ne-quality clarity like liquid sunshine in my glass on an overcast rainy sunday in early-febrewary. it also caused the gelt gang of mammon midas & croesus to jump up from my couch where they were watching the pens/caps pregame on my telly to join me in the kitchen for a taste. nose was royally hoppy! 8=o i was pleasantly surprised even as it caused me to sneeze in response. mouthfeel was medium good for a lager of any stripe. the taste was quite hoppy & bitter which was fine for me but totally out of whack for the style. 8=( from this site\s style guide: the hop character is low and should only balance with no signs of flavor or aroma. … for the most part this style has the least amount of flavor than any other style of beer. aarrgh! i have no choice to mark it down when reviewing to style & in this case it pains me. this was as crisp & hoppy as a pilsner really tasty & quite refreshing. finish remained crisp dry & hoppy. it actually scratched an itch for me but this was no miller lite/bud light/coors light. i would definitely want this in my beach-bound summer cooler! ymmv.
399,Yacht,4.02,picked it up for a buck on the weekly run. strong citrus smell with a hint of malt behind it. taste is crisp with nice carbonation. floral with a hoppy finish. very nice mouth feel. amazingly light and easy to drink but the carbonation and flavor fill the mouth and nose. overall surprised by how solid this is as a session lager. light enough to throw back a few but won’t water you down.
400,Yacht,3.62,excellent light beer. malty and a little sweet with decent fizz. goes down easy. give it a try.
401,Yacht,4.19,a: crisp gold in color with rich head and great lacing. n: grass soapy notes hops and light citrus/floral. t: follows the nose a crisp lager with excellent notes of grass hops floral and a slight dryness on the finish. m: light o: what a nice lager this was loads of flavor and so easy to drink. just a nice clean beer.
402,Yacht,3.72,appearance: pours clear and golden colored with a prodigious head; good retention and the lacing coats the glass  smell: grain grass and sulfur  taste: a lot of sulfur on the palate from start to finish; grainy and grassy otherwise  mouthfeel: light body with moderate to high carbonation  overall: rather disappointed by the sulfuric dominance here
403,Yacht,4.05,pale yellow body; thick fluffy white head; foam sticking to the sides of the glass. light fruity bouquet on the nose; melon and strawberries. delicate notes of light malts also with a low-key berry-like fruitiness; a little lemony; grassy; fine hop bitterness. light body; delicate; crisp and refreshing on the palate.  this is one fine pilsner lightness in body and delicate in the taste and aroma categories yet delivering some solid flavors throughout. there is a deft presence of fruitiness throughout and nicely balanced with a crisp dry hop bitterness. a session beer packed with depth and complexity. it makes for a fine summer quencher and would be suitable any time of the year when you want flavor and satisfaction but a heavier beer just doesnt fit the bill.
404,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.09,16 oz. can poured into mason jar look: one and a half finger head does not stay long golden color. good lacing. smell: malt with hints of sweetness. taste: medium bitterness not extraordinary not bad. finish is ok. feel: nice carbonation stays on tongue after swallowing. overall: i could take it or leave it. i would not seek it out if there were others of the style. pair with seafood.
405,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.51,24oz can date code sep2721. poured into a pint glass.  a - pours a clear yellow with a thin white head that leaves a little bit of lacing. head retention is fair; lots of small bubbles rising through the glass.  s - primarily malts and adjuncts; theres a bandage-like funk that shows up near the end of the nose thats a bit off-putting.  t - malty with a caramel-like sweetness; no discernable hop character. the funk present on the nose doesnt reveal itself in the taste.  m - medium-bodied with average carbonation and a smooth sweet finish. drinkability is good provided it stays cold.  o - for a regular strength ml (5.9%) its serviceable but better options exist. ymmv.
406,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.82,i have one idea what it looks like drank it straight from the can after fishing it from an iced down communal beer cooler in the middle of a pakistani valero at ih-10 and fry are. on the outskirts of houston. it was as you might have guessed ice cold. i only detected a sulphurous slightly putrid smell. the taste is as slightly sweet artificial grape drink (drank) (purple) slight alcohol warmth. it tastes a lot like despair. i’m so glad i only had 16 oz to drink. it will get the job done if you want a buzz but there’s much better ways to achieve that for the same price.
407,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.68,(16 oz can dec0919; purchased cold single... poured into fat tulip)  l: brilliantly-clear pale yellow-amber liquid; tall semi-tight silky white foam builds high slow crumble... thin collar remains a few islands of suds as well; some lace but much of it slides away  s: dried apple hint of white grape atop a powdered-donut doughy malt base; soft clove spice subtle cookie-ish baked grain note... no one element really stands out fair-moderate potency... malt fades in favor of spice and dried pomme  t: expected a little more base sweetness upon first sip but its merely a mellow white-bready dry malt foundation; the spice is even rather subdued lingering with a delicate boost of booze in the aftertaste... taste gets more muddy as it goes; bit of a medicinal alcohol builds in the back halfway through; slight nutty yeast aftertaste by the end  f: satiny smooth little afterburn... arguably a tad watery in the finish; arguably needs a lil more heat; otherwise dream drag and drop  o: last saw this summer 2015 but failed to pull the trigger - been looking for it since... an open-minded venture into an anecdotally seedy dive bar in my buddys town reaped its reward of sorts (basically just the review)... disappointingly a little too bland of a taste but fantastically drinkable (1518)
408,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.11,first impression:  d / not recommended  *** 07/08/19 can:  a bit sweet and a biteen syrupy but not as off putting as many budget malt liquors. corn 6-row cooked grain. has a warm alcohol undertone thats unpleasant but not intolerable.  no overt hop flavours are present to any extent. not metallic or otherwise off.  unrefreshing but drinkable. ive had worse student tipples in my day. wouldnt be a repeat buy with mickeys on the market...  d+ / not recommended
409,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),4.76,poured from a 12oz can into a imperial pint glass it has a toasted malt aroma and a decent flavor to match good old style aal.
410,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3,to me the king of malt liquors. overall i would rate it as average because there are none from this category i would consider outstanding. is a sweet smelling and tasting brew light bodied but extremely poundable. lets be honest if your drinking mls youre not looking for sipping brews.
411,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.62,l: thick head decent lacing deep golden color.  s: sweet malt and corn. fairly weak.  t: very sweet basically no hops inoffensive but not very rich or grainy.  f: medium bodied with very clean finish. not as carbonated as the x.l. schlitz malt liquor (red bull)  overall: you could do worse than this one but its not even better than oe 800. i like the red bull x.l. schlitz better as it is not as sweet. a middle of the road malt liquor that is worth a try but not worth going out of your way for.
412,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),4.94,this economy beer is a major contender with top notch brews. for the price i recommend you skip pabst miller and coors. go for the bull. the look is super clear light straw in appearance. the presentation of the can is fair. since this is a economic beer i suppose the design is not bad. the nose is sweet and yeasty with some slight spoiled grain smell. meh the smell is boring. for flavor this is not exceptional but very similar to miller high life. top end sweetness with faint yeast/white bread notes quickly goes into some maltiness and hop bitterness in the middle. the finish is a little wet. i really enjoyed the body of this beer. good sting carbonation that pricks your pallet with a fantastic creamy texture as it goes down. very nice medium body. as you drink the hops and ethyl acetate build up on your pallet rendering your taste buds useless. i believe schlitz malt liquor tastes much better than miller high life due to the fact high life has a thin body and a overwhelming canned vegetable taste. this beer has none of that! if you are looking for something with more flavor and more alcohol hit i recommend this beer!
413,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.67,pours a clear bright golden yellow with medium head. smell is pretty light corn and grain. taste is sweet malt grain and a hint of apple in the finish. better than expected.
414,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.1,one of the better malt liquors out there and i have tried about all of them. i remember the old commercial don\t say beer say bull. if i want a little boost during an afternoon of draining cans i generally alternate the bull and whatever aal is in the fridge at the time. not wonderful but it does the job and i have never sputtered in disgust when taking a sip/chug of one of these. then again i don\t ask for much. between all of the smoking i did in my younger days (thankfully behind me) and all of the spicy foods i like now my taste buds may be sub-par. good for me \cause i will drink about anything.
415,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),5,schlitz oml is a great malt liquor just hard to find so you end up drinking what is available near home or close
416,IPA,3.78,pours a toasted golden color with a big rocky off-white head. some soapy lacing on the glass.  a mix of floral and piney hops in the aroma. a little bit of bud and perhaps mint. bright.  a light toasted malt. a bit heavier than most ipas. the hops are earthy with light pine notes.  the malt is a beefy on the palate. fairly balanced but finishes with a earthy bitterness.  misses the mark on style. more of a hoppy apa. the malt is quite substantial. its good though.
417,IPA,4.57,appearance: slightly hazy amber. big fluffy white head with good retention. fast rising bubbles.  aroma: citrus pine and grassy.  flavor: citrus pine and grassy. medium to low sweetness. moderate bitterness.  mouthfeel: low astringency soft on the palate by finishes dry. moderate length finish.  overall: an iconic ipa out of ga. initial aromas are of citrus (grapefruit-like) and pine; however as it warms and aerates you begin to pick up additional aromas of which fresh cut grass was most noticeable. the tastes are just as complex. you get a nice malty sweetness intermixed with citrus pine and herbs. none of which are powerful or offensive. it finishes semi-dry with a short eloquent bitterness. perfectly balanced and harmonized. nothing boring or harsh in this ipa start to finish. one of my favorites.
418,IPA,3.96,dank drying and tasty.
419,IPA,4.25,yum a refreshing and delightful ipa. just the right amount of hops and a surprisingly light mouth feel. tastes and smells like a well thought out ipa. the folks at sweetwater have a winner!
420,Kriek De Ranke,3.25,mostly acidic really cherry barely come through to me. slight funky farmhouse smell.
421,Kriek De Ranke,4.01,bottle from mail order sampled at a couple of years old. lightly hazy deep brick red in color with a bubbly off white head that had to be coaxed. rich earthy funk and plenty of lemony lactic and a huge helping of sour tart cherries. lightly gritty mouthfeel but a fine beverage imho.
422,Kriek De Ranke,4.25,bevis maun is drinking a kriek de ranke by brouwerij de ranke at café beermoth  aroma is cherry b’s but super sour flavour salted turkish delight  bottle bottle comment toast 13 hours ago view detailed check-in delete check-in
423,Kriek De Ranke,4.16,750ml bottle into a teku glass best before: 09-03-2023  pours a hazy strawberry red color with a fairly large fizzy pink head that dissipates quickly down to nothing. carbonation appears huge. aromas of berry jam pale malts subtle funk tart red fruits including of course cherry but also strawberry. there’s a uniqueness to the aroma that differentiates it’s from most lambic perhaps a product of the blending as it appears this is not 100% lambic but a blend with some other base beer. regardless i really did the aroma. taste is much more sour than the aroma implied. balanced by the big berry notes. some oak only funk is the burnt plastic kind there’s almost no pungent character which i prefer. mouthfeel is a bit harsh it’s just so heavily carbonated it’s almost hard to drink without belching or getting hiccups. never had that happen with a beer before. this also somewhat limits it’s drinkability. overall quite a nice beer but lacking when compared to some of the greatest belgium lambic.   4/4.25/4.25/3.5/4.25
424,Kriek De Ranke,3.46,750 ml bottle. bright red. smells of cherries bitter earthy yeast funk and a little oak. tastes of earthy yeast notes cherry oak a little dried grass. medium body and well carbonated. not terribly sour which is nice. good all around.
425,Kriek De Ranke,3.95,shared 750 ml bottle at mikkeller bar aarhus. red color pinkish off-white head. dryish aroma of sour cherries and farmhouse. bone dry flavour with notes of sour cherries and brettanomyces.
426,Kriek De Ranke,4.18,pours a slightly hazy strawberry head; big effervescent to start that quickly falls back to a slight ring no retention. nose sour cherry red wine red wine vinegar and oak. taste is relatively moderate on the sour scale balanced by a bit of sweet cherry. there a bit of underlying bitterness mid-palate and the oak shines through as well on the finish. very refreshing very enjoyable.
427,Kriek De Ranke,4.09,very hazy orange color with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipates. no retention or lacing. pungent sour tart cherry aroma. red wine. tart cherry and red wine taste with nice sourness. medium bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation. 3.75 4 4.25 3.5 4.25
428,Kriek De Ranke,4.13,pours a cloudy ruby red coloration with a medium quickly dissipating fluffy pinkish head. smells of sweet and tart red cherries citrus acidity and just a hint of funk and earthy/musty oak. taste is a great balance of mellow sweet and tart red cherries but really more tart than sweet with a light citric acidity and very light but noticeable funk as well as just a hint of earthy/musty and lightly tannic oak. finishes with a light tartness and acidity and some cherries and oak lingering in the aftertaste. smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  this is a really nice and mellow kriek thats a blend of flemish sour ale and lambic giving this a milder tartness with just a hint of funk which makes for a rather mellow balance with a great refreshing drinkability that totally makes up for the lack of complexity if thats what youre in the mood for on a hot summers day. very nice balance of sweet and sour notes as well with the sour notes staying firmly on top never letting this become too sweet.
429,Beck's Premier Light,2.9,first off i am not a fan of light beers. but this doesn’t really taste like other light beers. true it doesn’t have much color or body but compared to every other “light” beer i have sampled this beer hits it out of the park. it actually has some flavor. i have not tasted anything close to this that has only 64 calories. plus it only has 2.3% alcohol perfect for hot summer days when you want to drink more than a few beers and still stay relatively sober. given the low calorie and alcohol content this is a superior product.  i think most reviewers are being somewhat unfair with their reviews. if you lined up 10 other light beers along with this beer in a taste test this beer would stand alone as real beer flavor. true if you did the same comparison with 10 other non-light german style beers it would finish last but that would be unfair because this is a light beer.  for what this is a low alcohol low calorie beer this is by far the best beer i have ever tasted.
430,Beck's Premier Light,1.65,it’s barely better than drinking carbonated water. i’m on a diet so this is what i’ve got.
431,Beck's Premier Light,2.87,the scores reflect my company becks light to all other beers possible but really you would want to review it against other beers in its category: light beer.  pros:  a lot of flavor for 64 calories. against other super low calorie beers the difference in taste and feel is remarkable. it is also filling like its calorie high original. though it does this by being quite foamy. the low alcohol content and filling quality of this beer means you can nurse them all night and not get drunk. you can sober up nursing a six pack of these!  cons:  bloated from the fizz. if you intent to get drunk by drinking this you might want to think again. youd have to have a hearty ability to drink!  overall: i like this beer when i go to a poker party. everyone wants to do shots and drink. but they dont know im drinking a beer that will sober you up. they assume its german and therefore must have lots of alcohol. great beer if you are the dd. you can nurse them and never get drunk.
432,Beck's Premier Light,1.92,i recently made a field trip our to subs & six packs on columbia avenue while running another errand. i saw this in the cooler & when i realized that i had never heretofore reviewed it i seized upon the opportunity.  from the bottle: beck\s quality brewed under the german purity law of 1516.  i pop!ped the cap only to get a wafting odor of old noble hops and corn silage. ugh. i upended the bottle to get it over with & briefly got two fingers of fizzy foamy bone-white head that quickly dissipated to wisps for my trouble. color was pale-straw (srm = 1 -2) with ne-quality clarity. nose smelled like saaz hops that had seen better days along with a corn malodor that did nothing for me. ugh. mouthfeel was thin & watery. ugh. the taste was just more watered-down aal corn & noble hops wasted in a brew that can only be intended for the uninitiated. ugh. finish left me with a good case of buyers regret. ugh.
433,Beck's Premier Light,2.38,not all that bad for a light beer. it still has a full flavor and body to it unlike most light beers so thats a plus a negative though is that it is super light on abv% at 2.3% so youre gonna end up drinking a lot of them just to get a good buzz.
434,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.35,pours a nearly clear golden color with a 1f head and moderate lacing.  smells of slightly dank grassy piney hoops with citrus.  tastes of light malt slightly tart grapefruit with sweeter orange and lemon with a moderately bitter alcohol warm finish.  medium light body and carbonation. dry mouthfeel.  this is a lightly juicy crisp assertive west coast ipa.
435,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.25,pours a hazy amber color with a nice head and lacing aroma has malt and hop hints the taste has a malt and hop flavor a medium bodied well carbonated beer a good iipa
436,Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.47,from the bottom of the can: pkgd on 11/18/22 q0711 this was a 16oz can from a 4-pack.  appearance: the body is nearly opaque which allows only a very faint haze of a blurry shadow through. it has a deep golden amber body which is on the darker side but not quite bronze. there is a short and fluffy white head which maintains a thin layer of fluffy film over the surface with a creamy and fluffy ring around the glass. there is some spotty lacing.  aroma: at first some wildflower aroma came through then some fruity peach and grapefruit came to the nose. there is a touch of cabbage but each time it becomes apparent it pops out and is replaced by a more fruity aroma.  taste: the flavor closely mimics the aroma here. there is this somewhat floral opening to the beer giving it a wildflower note up front which is a bit soap-like. then it develops more citrus character on the tongue; largely this mixture of pithy grapefruit and blood orange. these two citrus notes persist to the end. it has a somewhat grassy finish. after a while some candied orange also comes through a tad.  mouthfeel: bitterness on this beer is high. it has a body that is on the lower edge of medium with a touch of slickness. it is a bit of a slow drinker given the high bitterness and the somewhat medium body.  overall: the citrus notes in this beer and the strong bitterness are the highlights. there is plenty to enjoy when it comes to both of these qualities. the beer also has a floral note which is not bad but when combined with the grassy character it clashes with the more citrus-centric notes of the beer. its an alright beer but im not likely to buy it again over what is readily available on the market. the beer i purchased was consumed within 3 months of being canned so i might try it again if it was on tap or if it was fresher than the one i purchased. i wouldnt advocate for or against it but i would recommend a single can or a sampler before buying a 4-pack.
437,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.25,a piney citrusy bitter bomb. outstanding.
438,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.24,6 oz draft mini-snifter pour at lures bar & grille. this is a great old school dipa. caramel malt some alcohol heat (in a good way) citrus peel with a solid hit of bitterness. very tasty overall.
439,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,1.69,330 ml bottle from the n/a shelf at vinmonopolet kvadrat. very pale golden colour moderate white head. strong and sickly aroma of carrots boiled far too long maize baby porridge and unfermented industrial pilsener wort. the flavour is not good but not totally undrinkable when the beer is cold. at least there are hints of malts and hops.
440,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.35,from hipercor. in teku glass. at lunch with omelette. it only has slight traces of the typical unpleasantness of 00 not bothering much while drinking it. apart from that complete dullness
441,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.68,beer pours a pale translucent gold capped by two fingers of loose foam that persists for longer than expected but does ultimately recede to a thin layer and then some islands. a bit of lacing and a lot of visible carbonation.  smell is bready biscuity malt light cracker. faint sourness slightly grassy hops bitter greens. a touch metallic.  taste is slightly sour malt biscuit. faint hop bitterness more bitter salad greens slight metallic twang. carbonation is high and the body is quite watery. but at least there is some hop presence here?  ive had worse. it doesnt compete with krombacher--which i would consider the standard-bearer of na beers--but its recognizably beery and not outright offensive. drink it *ice*-cold from the bottle and you might even be able to fool your taste-buds into thinking youre drinking an american light lager.
442,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,1,i wish i could rate this lower.  drain-pour!
443,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,1.5,
444,Skol,2.06,bought at a supermarket in algorta (spain).  -pours translucid yellow colour. slim foam head. -almost no smell. -very very light taste. -bitter after taste.  dull beer.
445,Skol,1.72,carbonatación media. cuerpo extremadamente ligero. una cerveza acuosa dulce casi sin rastros de amargor. sería como la cerveza corona pero de brasil.
446,Skol,2.35,from festival de las naciones. in teku glass. playing the last door season 2. the closest thing to water ive ever found in a beer can. no aroma no taste no aftertastewatery. at least hasnt anything unpleasant either
447,Skol,2.64,i had this beer at the airport in sao paulo. from a can the beer is a light american-style lager. smells of corn a bit of grass. lightly sweet and grainy. not as dry as many of the style but not very interesting. simple straightforward and uninteresting.
448,Avec Les Bons Voeux,3.93,750 ml corked & caged bottle from vinmonopolet nettbutikken. abv is 9.5%. slightly hazy golden colour huge white head. aroma of spicy belgian ale yeast white kandij sugar syrup and spicy hops. the same spicy notes in the flavour also sufficient malts hints of yellow plums not too sweet bitter finish. refreshing for its strength.
449,Avec Les Bons Voeux,3.75,nice saison. farmhouse flavour malty spicy. had no clue it was so strong really hides it with the dry finish. feels close to westlake triple honestly
450,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.06,10 oz snifter draft pour at frisco taphouse in crofton md. the description is pretty accurate - notes of banana lemon clove and belgian yeast esters. fairly sweet and also boozy. i agree that this is edging towards being a tripel - which is not really what i want when i drink a saison. i like saisons to be more on the delicate side and this is definitely not a delicate beer. still a good beer just...well i am tempted to say its not true to style but this is brasserie dupont were talking about. so i wont say it.
451,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.35,poured from 750 ml bottle to a chalice glass. poured beautiful gold color with a white head on top that didnt go away. lively body with carbonation throughout. smell was grainy apples and cinnamon funky earthy tones. taste starts a bit sweet with bread and grain. then the earthy funk kicks in with yeast and straw/grassy flavors. finish is rather dry and the funk lingers. feel is light and bubbly as the carbonation keeps it alive. a crisp dry finish is the perfect end. overall this is great sipper with a lot of interesting flavor. id buy this again for sure.
452,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.43,the beer pours a voluminous white and fluffy head that takes a while to dissipate while the beer itself is a clear metallic amber color that looks very good.  the smell is delicious. it has a mix of fruity notes and light bread notes mixed with an earthy bitterness from the hops.  the taste is fantastic. the belgian spice notes dominate the taste at first but the apple and pear notes come in rather quickly without displacing the yeast notes. there is also a light caramel taste to it as well. while the beer starts sweet it starts to become more bitter than sweet quickly. the earthy bitter hop notes come out towards the finish to round out the beer.  the feel is amazing! it starts off with a bit of stickiness before becoming fairly dry! the carbonation is tingling while the texture is fluffy smooth with a medium body to it.  overall this is a fantastic beer worth getting and having if available.
453,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.19,the progression from refreshingly sweet to drying and somewhat bitter is very enjoyable
454,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.49,purchased from the international beer collector christmas sale in november 2021 and drunk in july 2022.  the beer comes in a sturdy-looking green corked bottle. there\s a satisfying pop and hiss as the cork is pryed loose followed by a whiff of smoke and an immediate orchard fruit scent at the neck of the bottle.  on the nose as previewed at the opening theres peach and apricot spicy yeast vanilla and pepper. wow ive not even had it in my mouth and i can tell its going to be something complex and special.  in the mouth spicy belgian yeast dominates at first but the orchard fruits quickly announce their presence. there also the vanilla from the nose and bitter orange peel and candied lemon. at the swallow there is substantial earthy bitterness thats quite sharp and not at all what i was expecting. the finish is dry but the bitterness lingers long after the swallow.  mouthfeel is luxurious. its smooth and counteracts the lingering bitterness well. theres quite a bit of carbonation but the sweetness bitterness and bubbles all work together seemlessly. a follow-up mouthfeel demands attention.  overall this is a magnificent beer. theres complexity that isnt always evident in saisons or farmhouse ales which takes the beer beyond the standard belgian yeast lemon candy and pepper/herbal profile that those styles can fall back on. i cant remember a better saison or farmhouse ale and in fact cant remember too many better beers full stop.  cheers!
455,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.18,vinous and elegant with orchard fruit impressions plumping it up and a tangy yeast funk drying it out quite a brew... stone fruits like peach and apricot accompany white wine grapes with a twang on the finish - amply carbonated and lightly spicy with notes of cardamom clove ginger and nutmeg... sediment on the finishing pour...
456,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.13,a delicious saison lots of things going on nice levels of funky farmhouse flavours leathery oaky nutty has a dank quality to it some nice sweet flavours pear apricot caramel lot of vanilla some brown bread also champagne spice medium bodied with high levels of carbonation shows it’s strength nicely medium bitterness on the finish quite dry really quite nice to drink good stuff
457,Avec Les Bons Voeux,3.79,look - nice golden fairly clear with slight rimming and head smell - grainy funky fruity taste - apricot banana floral slight funky and boozy feel - medium light body with a slight carb overall - pretty tasty almost hefe ish
458,Black Tuesday - Reserve,3.64,look - black and thick with a nice tan head and sticy lacing smell - so much barrel taste - booze booze booze... barrel and chocolate but overly boozy feel - thick slight carb overall - the booze is killing this beer
459,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.75,2020 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. bottle #1041 dated 2/11/2020. an absolute beast. boozy thick and mildly sweet.
460,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.75,2021 vintage bottle share at a bottle share on 12/3/22. amazing beer; drank fairly easily and just a ton of flavour and barrel in the taste. it was a little on the boozy side not terrible but id expect that from a 21% abv beer.
461,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.52,2020 vintage  oh man we have quite the big boy here. a 21% on a tuesday afternoon? what the hell am i doing? well i’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day so i figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer i received in a bif from the legendary @eziel. i’m getting close to the end of what he sent me and they’re all heavy hitters. let’s see what this one is all about  pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  there’s a definite sweetness in the nose but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. i’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge earthy bourbon toasted oak nougat black cherry sweet caramel molasses toasted hazelnut and light vanilla  this one really packs a punch in taste heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting charred oak cacao sweet bourbon red grape marshmallow sweet vanilla molasses toffee light nutty malt and black cherry. the swallow brings notes of hot bourbon charred oak nougat cacao black cherry molasses apple brandy vanilla sweet caramel and nougat  a full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell  there’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. so complex and hitting all the right notes. perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains
462,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.22,2021 batch. most of the bt reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon.  this one pours a very dark black color with a small head and no lacing.  this smells like charred oak lots of bourbon lots of vinous grape character brandy roasted malt dark fruit.  this is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based black tuesday variants and the regular bourbon black tuesday. the grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character sweet but finishes dry with oaky char marshmallow dark chocolate caramel roast and bourbon.  this is medium bodied slightly thin as most black tuesday variants tend to be with a lots of concentrated booziness. it’s not overwhelmingly boozy but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.  i haven’t had much bruery in a while but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. it’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people like 10 people maybe but it’s well done.
463,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.56,750 ml wax capped bottle 2021 edition (aged in copper & kings grape brandy barrels for a year then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels) 21.8% abv bottled 01/19/21. served in a black tuesday chalice the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. i like the aroma a lot the brew smells like dark fruit brandy bourbon vanilla molasses dark chocolate and roasted malt. i like the taste a lot too its similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread burnt/charred malt coffee licorice and earthy flavors. theres a lot going on here but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. mouthfeel/body is full its coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. nowhere near as boozy as i was expecting considering how strong this brew is! certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!
464,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.33,i believe this was a 2018 bottle (4 years aged). leaned towards a more licorice flavor. didn’t pick up much bourbon. solid beer/liquor drink (20% it’s hard to still consider this a beer). my guess is that perhaps it’s a little better if it were fresher maybe 6-12mo age which is generally where i like my ba stouts.
465,Polar Pilsen,2.58,from a bottle. clear golden color with a few white bubbles. skunky aroma. light body with good carbonation. tastes of grain and corn with a bitter finish. average euro lager a tick mark for venezuela anyway.
466,Polar Pilsen,3.74,cerveza polar i would say is one of the most popular beers in venezuela. although there are other brands polar is the favorite and first choice. talking about this beer light yellow color refreshing abv 4.5 taste good nothing remarkable. birra for everyone and everyday... cheers. a couple of days later im going to taste polar 1941 special edition abv 7. then i would tell you how it goes..
467,Polar Pilsen,2.27,date: july 25 2022... occasion: our first night in aruba is a success--time to celebrate with a beer i haven\t had in more than two decades... glassware: nondescript 10 oz. pokal... a picture of consistency: its light golden amber body builds a bank of soft craggy head that leaves behind articulate lacing--attractive save for the lack of effervescence... sharp sweet malts burnt toffee a bit of weirdly expressed bitterness candied sugars and perfumed hops make this a beer that sends a drink me quickly message... beefier than expected it holds its place long enough after the initial sip to leave a softer grainy finish... a bit more than a rinser the malts are slightly burnt sweet and almost chewable--striking for a beer that otherwise requires a tropical setting to be enjoyed... i don\t mind that i waited this long to review a beer i innocently randomly ordered in russell\s--it most likely tastes better in the setting we\re in now!
468,Polar Pilsen,2.58,pretty bad. essentially less nose than michael jackson. low on flavor. tastes like cheap 28oz. clearglass lager in the hood in august. feel is fine for 8oz but it gets flat quick. wouldn’t really purchase this with my own money by choice if there were other options.
469,Polar Pilsen,4,found this in a grocery store in the caribbean a while back and it was cheap crisp and refreshing - perfect for a warm summer day. surprisingly good for the price if youre looking for a lighter beer thats hoppier than an american light beer.
470,Polar Pilsen,2.78,the pour is from an 8 oz. can thats rather small & interesting. oh look there is a cute polar bear on the front of the can & the beer pour a medium flow of carbonation with a white foamy head that dies down rather quickly. i do notice a best by date on the bottom of the can which indicates that theyre giving this beer a long shelf life. the aroma is of grains with faint corn in the background. the taste matches the nose but its subpar compared to many other pilsner beers that ive had in the past. i dont know if this beer is brewed in aruba venezuela or florida but wherever its from it needs a tweak here & there. . its not a disgusting pilsner nor is it a tasty one either. cheers! c
471,Polar Pilsen,1.75,cerveza con cabeza visible. tiene un cuerpo ligero y es de carbonatación alta. en su aroma se percibe granos mantequilla y jarabe de maíz. una vez en boca destaca el jarabe y una sensación herbácea.
472,Duchesse De Bourgogne,2.18,i wanted to love it. love sours and all kinds of fruit beers but this was not my cup of tea. looked wonderful but one whiff of the rotten apple smell put me off. thought ok smell isn’t great but taste had to be better. nope! as bad as i didn’t like the smell i liked that more than the taste. to me tasted like what i would envision nail polish remover tasting like. hubby didn’t agree with my acetone comparison but he too thought that it was just not good.
473,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.74,opulent.  bright acidity balanced with medium carbonation make this beautiful palette cleansing opener. bright cherry and balsamic vinegar on the nose wish a dash of barnyard funk. tart cherry notes evolve into a sweet (but not overly so) balsamic vinegar finish that just begs for another sip. those who resist will enjoy the long lavish finish. enjoy with wild game or short ribs.  served in a burgundy glass at around 50 degrees fahrenheit.
474,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.6,the brew is solid dark brown more dull than shiny and opaque. a good deal of light is required to catch a reddish tint. this serving was drawn from a tap and presented in a clear pint glass. on top lays the most marginal of heads thats sort of biege. it brings those belgian smells of yeast malt alcohol and some hops. the initial taste is a sweet and sour blast more sweet until as it finishes a vinegar-like presence is detected. its an enjoyable transition. overall this is malty big with not much bite from the hops. that makes the sourness even more appreciated. theres much less alcohol to taste as there was in the aroma. thankfully the oak tannins dont turn this into something that tastes like a boilermaker. even without a head nor glass lacing this looks good especially since it went down so rich and smoothly. perhaps it will take having a sweet tooth to love this one.
475,Duchesse De Bourgogne,3.84,rather sour pleasantly so with a lemony -lactate flavor.
476,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4,nice palette cleanser to start off with. good balance of cherry tartness and sweetness. the last batch i had in draft was noticeably sweeter than previous versions. i taste tested against the bottle and it was obvious. i hope it was merely an issue with that barrel and not a change in the recipe. otherwise a great beer.
477,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.51,l - brown with bright red hues and highlight with a tan head that dissipates somewhat slowly leaving behind a thin cal s - tons of brett funk bready yeast sweet malts and fruit esters - red berries t - complex. brett funk and bright cherry up front and throughout intermixed with notes of caramel bready yeast balsamic vinegar figs and dates maybe even some chocolate f - light bodied with high carbonation o - a truly unique and fantastic belgian ale
478,Duchesse De Bourgogne,3.64,this tastes like balsamic vinegar with sweet fruity notes woody notes and cheesy notes just like balsamic. i love balsamic. if you hate balsamic vinegar this is not the beer for you. the beer does not feel thick like vinegar - it has a nice drinkable mouthfeel. the beer does not look like vinegar - it has a lovely rich dark brown color. although it does not look or feel like balsamic it tastes like it. (a birthday gift from carrie and erik.)
479,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.33,dark ruby red on the eyes and red wine vinegar on the nose. full of fruit flavor dominated by cherry. it is both funky/sour and sweet with neither overpowering the other. medium carbonation and feels like a wine although maybe my mouth is influenced by my eyes. very good i would have one again.
480,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.03,look: deep reddish brown with a beautifully thick cream-colored head.  smell: i’m immediately reminded of red wine vinegar but not in a bad way. oak and some sort of red berry with a distinct musty funk (again not in a bad way).  taste: an elegant mix of sweet and sour but not overall as complex as the nose. no real fruit in the taste and not much funk beyond the general sour nature of the style.  feel: more carbonated than expected. thin but not watery.  overall: one of the most wine-like beers i’ve ever tried. i come to this after already trying the sour cherry variant and while i miss the cherries in this version it’s still an excellent beer and one of the defining examples of its style.
481,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.21,this is a beautiful great tasing beer. murky reddish brown color with an absolutely gorgeous fluffy head and outstanding curtain lacing. tart fruit smell and taste. dark cherries figs dates oak. both sweet and tar and a bit funky. maybe a tad too sweet. very nice beer.
482,Chocolate Stout,3.62,draught (nitro) ibu: 69 velvety tan head. thick and bold black looking elixir. soft dark and caramelized roasted grains for the aroma. slightly watered down dark roasted grain and dark chocolate flavor that is ok.
483,Chocolate Stout,4.69,this beer is really good. beautiful opaque look with a smaller dark khaki head. first sip and you already taste the chocolate. this isn’t your normal dark chocolate stout this is a milk chocolate flavor and it is good. probably higher on the calories so probably only have one but if you get the chance to try it do it.
484,Chocolate Stout,3.88,not really into chocolate but friend dropped off some stouts and this was one of them. would not buy it but for what it is it’s well crafted. dessert beer. makes me miss lagers.
485,Chocolate Stout,4.25,pours a very dark color with nice head and lacing aroma has very generous dark chocolate hints the taste follows the nose with a well balanced very enriched chocolate flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a good stout
486,Chocolate Stout,3.53,on tap at das beer garden. black body with a nice creamy khaki head. smells of cocoa and roasted malt. tastes of cocoa and roar malt as well. milk chocolate without the milk. roasted malt and light bitterness in its stead. medium body and very drinkable. low carbonation. hitting some of the old classics and this does not disappoint.
487,Alpha King,4.4,from my review in nbw 138:  hello all! lets get this new beer weekend started shall we?  this one is three floyds alpha king sent to me by the inestimable @turkeysdrinkbeer many moons ago and one that has been begging me to drink it for some time now...  so onto the review!  ....   this beer has sat in my fridge for six months. it came to me pride beating in simmering waves from its aluminium chest across the continental usa leaping the pacific ocean and docking prouder than john holmes in a ruler factory at the back of my fridge.  since that time it has mocked me. dared me to drink to partake of its malty dank body. but i have been iron of will and clear of mind. other beers have begged attention required consumption or perched testily at the edge of my fridge. this one has waited and i have been strong.  today though. today is dawned bright clear and autumnal. the air is crisper than it should be. autumn has slid sneakily to my house bringing weather not yet welcome for months. it is cool but i wear shorts in stubborn refusal to bow to sensibility. it makes me angry. i am stubborn and i am steadfast. but as afternoon breaks i am wroth and this beer is front and centre.  angrily i pour. this beer has mocked me but now i call the shots. in response it flares its fluffy white warning clouds at me. unperturbed i sit and wait still and at one with time. ere long it subsides. meekly it exposes its dark caramel-amber coat easel to its thin off-white head. moderate carbonation follows but king of my liquid domain i barely acknowledge the elemental offering of carbon and oxygen. no ritual obeisance will slake my thirst. [l: 4.25]  i offer my nose as the beer unbowed by curt dismissal of its visual defences throws rich chewy caramel notes at me. i rebuff the scent but it follows with a volley of umami-laced soy background notes. i pause. hark my nasal messenger do i detect the glory of the titanic pale ales of my spotted craft beer youth? my first stumble the first scintilla of doubt. does this bear the ghosts of the pale ales of yesteryear? if so can i stand before its glory? [s: 4.25]  i regain my chest-forward arrogant composure. the taste will not mirror the nose. without a doubt a tropical umbrella-bedecked fruit tingle lies in ambush beneath the olfactory assault i have endured. beer of 2023 can not follow malty talk with commensurate walk. but i am mistaken: taste mirrors the nose with rich tangy chewy caramel and toffee. in backup are deep umami malt notes that envision unearthed deep soil and the bugs that huddle within. it follows with moderate danky retronasal bitterness sitting at the back of my tongue building and building before turning back into a long tangy caramel finish. this is no tropical fruit bomb! i am bereft of defence to this sorcerous beer! i twist and turn refusing to partake but am trapped in this beers embrace! and it knows it. it knows lord it knows. i must take more. i am slave to this delicious throwback to malty pale ale goodness. [t: 4.5]  it refuses to let up. it throws a smooth and full mouthfeel at me as though nought but an afterthought. it waves away my loving embrace of its carbonation previously dismissed like so much unwanted chaff. this beer knows better and it knows how to play its cards. it is harmony yet it has broken mine. [m: 4.25]  this beer has sat in my fridge for six months watching waiting. it pounced when i suffused with arrogance sought to bring it to its barley-kissed knees. instead it reminded me of the power of malty hoppy goodness. reminded me that a whole history of beer lies unloved forgotten in our lust for tropical sour and pastry highs discarded as soon as the next sacrifice kneels at the block. this beer has held its own after an improbable journey to my fridge and then beaten my senses back into shape as it taught me a lesson i should not have needed to learn and will study for time to come. [o: 4.5]  cheers! #212
488,Alpha King,3.91,another great apa from 3f. very good in every way especially balance between bitterness and smooth. you get them both! great for more than one. put it side- by-side with zd and report back. you have a winner with either.
489,Alpha King,4.14,pours block out the light dark and even.a gentle pour produces an inch of copper head.  nice sugary chocolate smell. bit of burnt wood.  some malty sweetness on the front which builds to a mixture of toasty flavors and even a bit of nuttiness. quite smooth and complexity of flavors grow as it warms. alcohol is present and there is burnt flavor maybe like a burnt marshmallow that lingers. the beer never strays to far from its porter base.  very good seasonality offering.
490,Alpha King,4.84,citrus and caramel aromas  with tastes of malt followed by a hop profile that doesnt overwhelm. excellent classic apa.
491,Hoegaarden Citron,3.17,the foggy and very pale yellow body almost darkens to dull tan under an unevenly short of-white head.  if i closed my eyes im not sure i could have told you that this wasnt leinys but for perhaps a little more of a wheat profile. its just a soft wet blanket of sweet faintly malty lemonade through and through.
492,Hoegaarden Citron,1.55,250 ml bottle as hoegaarden citron thanks to tarjei. abv is 3.0%. very pale straw coloured slightly hazy big to moderate white head. aroma of lemon and lime (as expected) also more unpleasant notes of rotting fruits and vomit. the flavour is sugary sweet and citrussy without the zesty freshness i hoped for (considering the beer had already had the misfortune of being diluted with this citrus stuff). nope this is not a beer for me. drainpour.
493,Hoegaarden Citron,4.5,a bottle at pub & grill argentina in brussels.
494,Hoegaarden Citron,2.8,colour: light straw with a slight pink tinge cloudy. foam white fine-bubble quickly reduces. the aroma of raspberry lime somehow empty. taste: the first sip and the beginning of linden honey in a moment reappear sweet raspberry and lime this time synthetic. very poorly and thin
495,Hoegaarden Citron,3,q qw qwer we reqw wqe
496,Sinebrychoff Porter,3.73,i’m not sure how old this beer is. i tried to peel off the sticker to see the bb date but it got erased.  it’s probably past the date.  nice pour: dark brown color with a 2f head.  the aroma is weird: unlike any aroma from a beer i’ve tasted. woody caramel. not bad but not pleasant.  mf is medium smooth.  the taste mimics the aroma. i can’t define it. not like the other baltic porters i’ve tasted which have a more defined porter taste.  overall: unusual but just okay.
497,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.02,330ml bottle. i think the date coding is under a later affixed jahrgang 1816 sticker. black colored body with a red mahogany back lit edge. two fingers of tan head fizzes away in about a minute. no lacing. aroma of dark roasted malts caramel a bit of smoke and black licorice. taste is dark roasted malts chocolate caramel prune a bit of smoke and black licorice. bitterness at the end. more than medium mouth feel. seems a little chalky and dry especially in the throat. quiet carbonation. good overall but reminds me of an old flat carbonated cola (without the sugar/corn syrup). flavors linger only for a short while.
498,Sinebrychoff Porter,3.83,part of a gift. drank from the undated bottle. dark bakers chocolate smell good mouth feel. taste is a bit dry some chocolate and coffee? in the rear. overall a good beer that just seems to be missing something. is it old? should i try the other bottle in a glass? overall i enjoyed this but would not buy this beer unless i saw it on tap just to try that version.  i decided to pull the gold foil sticker off the bottom of the bottle. surprise best by 13 november 2020. fuck you shangys. there are other reasons i won’t buy beer from your shop and this is just another. how many other old beers are you putting stickers over dates. the sticker looked like it belonged till i really looked at it.
499,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.43,an excellent porter. nice roasted malt earthy wet skree (best way for me to describe the earthiness) dark bitter coffee a bit dry with a medium mouthfeel. the way it should be.
500,Sinebrychoff Porter,3.75,not sure about this one. there is a good maltiness to it with medium carbonation but significant bitterness followed by a smoke/burned taste. it is not a bad taste just not sure this all works together feels like it does not blend together kinda of clashes i think. maybe i just didnt have a lot of porter lately.
501,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.64,one of the finest porters i think i\ve ever tasted but that could have been just my mindset at the time. in any case it\s very good. pours near black with a short (1/2) head that dissipates to a trace. the aroma is wonderful i got loads of malts with notes of caramel and a whiff of maybe smoked barley? the taste follows the aroma and it too is wonderful. in addition to the caramel i sense licorice and that smoke essence. the feel is more than i expected just that good. this is definitely one i would be happy to have in the cellar on a regular basis. i sipped it slowly so as to savor the experience so good.
502,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.41,pours dark brown almost no head. chocolate aroma and burnt caramel taste with a slightly hoppy burnt toast aftertast. a very satisfying porter.
503,Sinebrychoff Porter,3.95,pours a lovely dark brown almost black color. completely opaque and rather thick in appearance. pillowy 3-4 finger mocha colored head dissipates slowly leaving a thin layer of bubbly foam on top of the beer. lots of stick lacing is left behind on the glass.  aroma has notes of roasted malts some dark fruits licorice and dry cocoa. there is a slight smoky aroma more reminiscent of smoked bbq (as someone described it) more that it is just straight up smoked malts like in a rauchbier. finally you do get some of that lager yeast coming through on the nose.  taste follows the nose you get some roasted malts cocoa dark fruit and licorice with a smoky finish. very earthy herbal hops provide some bittering on the back end. light smokiness comes through as the beer warms up with a definite smoked bbq like quality.  feel is light to medium bodied with a certain dry chalkiness to it. moderate carbonation prickles the tongue. that dryness to the beer carries into the finish.  overall this is a really nice baltic porter.
504,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.39,330ml bottle. impossible to decipher best before as the stamp overlaps the text.  black with a red tint at the edges. dense tawny head of decent height leaving medium lace.  nose is enticing. fudge mixed with licorice in the centre. roasted even some pleasantly burned aromas hot chocolate just a hint of red berries.  long aftertaste of bitterness mixing hops and dark chocolate. tart roasted bite at the front on the other hand. and in the middle both blend harmoniously.  still a uniquely smooth example within the style. hard to break into parts as the elements blend so well.
505,Sinebrychoff Porter,4.34,from old undated notes. poured from the bottle.  pitch black; no ruby around the edges.  small dark khaki head which quickly dissipates. almost no lacing.  nose is of smoked barbecue with a rich sweetness. pork ribs slathered in bbq sauce comes to mind. subtle black licorice as well.  thin mouthfeel; dangerously drinkable for such a dark porter.  slight metallic flavor on first sip; gives way to malted chocolate flavor. as the beer progresses the metallic taste (which all baltic porters have to me) goes away and reveals a roasted character. by far the best bp ive ever had; complex & enigmatic. would definitely buy again (and have).
506,Darkstar November,4.49,a - pour jet black with a thin tan head. light soapy lacing.  s - aroma is dark chocolate molasses and borubon.  t - the taste is dark chocolate molasses vanilla spicy rye and some light bourbon heat.  m - full body with medium carbonation. soft syrupy mouthfeel with a slick drying finish.  o - top notch ba stout.
507,Darkstar November,4.45,500 ml bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition had 1/14/23.  pours near black and opaque with no head and a little oily cling. aromas of bourbon rye chocolate vanilla roasted malt. has a bit of a sweet and spicy aroma. mostly the same flavors: bourbon rye chocolate malt vanilla some molasses. has a fairly spicy taste and a light sweet note. smooth a little creamy a solid full body appropriately carbonated.  strong barrels and lots of rye is a pretty good recipe. it’s a little sweeter than expected but this is pretty delicious.  rfob122718 0425
508,Darkstar November,4.5,darkstar november (2021) from bottle logic. 16.9 fl oz bottle from @2beerdogs in nbs bif #17. reviewed 17/06/23 (review 3125). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. bottom of label stamped “2021” and “batch *008*”. stored at 34 degrees at home. served at 61.2 degrees f (recommended on label 58 degrees f) in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 66.3 degrees f. appearance – 4.5 first pour – ruby brown (srm 24) slight light penetration. body – ruby brown (srm 24) opaque. under direct light opaque. when rear lite opaque except for light penetrating at the edges ruby. head: average (maximum 1.8 cm aggressive center pour) bronze high density quickly diminishing to a 0.15 – 0.35 cm undulating crown with no cap. lacing – none. aroma – 4.5 – bourbon and rye whiskies moderate chocolate and some roasted malt. no yeast no hops. no ethanol (14 % abv according to the label). flavor – 4.5 – chocolate and bourbon some rye spiciness light molasses sweetness and non-oppressive molasses flavor. no yeast no hops. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. no ethanol flavor – well-hidden until an unscheduled belch. pleasant gastric warming. palate – 4.5 – full; distinctly creamy; soft carbonation. final impression and summation: 4.5 damn this is good! i’m a freak for rye bread ipas stouts whiskeys. i don’t think i’ve ever had an average beer from bottle logic – they are superb!
509,Darkstar November,4.35,bottle: poured a pitch-black color stout with a dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. aroma of nice bourbon notes with some vanilla and woody notes nice black chocolate malt notes with some rye notes also perceptible. taste is also dominated by bourbon and vanilla notes with some rich black chocolate notes with some rye barrel notes also perceptible. body is full with a nice creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. well executed barrel-aged stout with some good drinkability.
510,Darkstar November,4.85,bourbon and rum. very heavy in taste body and on the nose. it hides the high abv exceptionally well. almost like a distilled dark red or port. the feel suffers a little but the smell and taste are unreal.
511,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.05,4/29/23 very well done. roasted malt coffee forward smooth. head dissipates quickly. would like to do a head to head vs guinness.
512,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.53,came upon this when ordering from craft beer cellar. i love complex coffee-forward beers so this sounded like a good choice. i had to drink from the can so i won’t be able to comment on the color head or lacing. even from the can i can smell a roast coffee dark cherry and cocoa. the taste is much complex than what i got from the smell. a combination of dark chocolate and roast coffee toast leather and a bit of ash as it wamrs. mouthfeel is of a medium body with moderate carbonation that is extremely smooth. i will definitely be ordering this again. listed as a irish dry stout i can see why it’s rated
513,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.26,time to knock out another style topper! here we have the highest rated irish dry stout on ba and one that has apparently held similar titles for a long time per the notes cadillac mtn. stout was selected world champion dry stout 1995 and the best hard-to-find beer in america by men’s journal. cool shit. let\s see if it can live up to the expectations i\ve built up in my head after having this marked as a want for 3 years  pours a muddy medium brown with a finger of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  as expected the roast is very evident in the nose but it is nicely balanced as well. im picking up on aromas of acidic coffee dark toast charred malt toffee sweet honey herbal hops and cocoa powder  its also quite smooth in taste for the amount of roasted malt thats present. on the front end of the sip im tasting dark chocolate medium roast coffee burnt toast caramel herbal hops and dark cherry. the swallow brings notes of acidic coffee cocoa powder earthy hops dark toast toffee light raisin and a touch of char  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a roasty and slick beer. finishes mostly dry and surprisingly refreshing  yeah this shit is awesome. super easy drinking even for a style where drinkability is pretty important. definitely deserving of its ranking. i think ill have to stock up on more now that i found it
514,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.3,lovely beer. drank it at the brewery which was a great place in the woods. not much head but lovely taste. quite a coffee vibe going on.
515,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.16,pours a dark brown color with ruby edges and a finger of beige head. the nose has roasty notes but also something sweet and almost toffee-like. roasted malt is the feature of the flavor profile. the finish is gently bitter.  i could drink this offering all night. no wonder its the #1 irish dry stout.
516,Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.74,meh. bitter
517,Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.99,purchased as a 6-pack in bottles. look: deep inky black. disappointing lack of head taste: hits you pretty strongly with a blackstrap molasses sweet-bitter combo. some bready flavors (dark pumpernickel). overall: its a decent beer but more of a sipper--the persistent bitterness means it doesnt pair well with food and youre ready for something different after one round of this stout.
518,Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.61,12oz bottle. poured out an opaque jet-black color with a small khaki-colored head of foam. it smelled roasty and chocolatey with toffee notes. sweet chocolate taste with some roasted notes.
519,Permanent Funeral,4.37,date: may 20 2023... occasion: i did not plan to write a review tonight...but then talk of band/beer/distillery collabs blew up and i felt compelled... glassware: maudite snifter... a dense opaque sediment-laden orange-amber body stares down the drinker with a thick off-white head settling to a frothy substantial halo... classic look... a hyper-boozy dankly resinous tree trunk falls on the nostrils with peach grapefruit dry grapes alcohol vapors and some backyard vegetable garden allure... a bit gritty... wow--its softness alarms almost as when expecting blunt force and receiving a tickle or a hug... the teeth are tingling for sure and the throat has a grond-like furnace warming but in between its smooth sailing and clear intentions--a beefy exhale is excusable when the inhale is this efficient at 10.5%... a big bouquet of grapefruit pineapple lemon bourbon mint thyme and the dank resin promised by the aroma... butterscotch and wet thatch balance its hop-heavy impact... this is a(nother) victory for the 3 floyds folks a sipper that breathes life into its drinker while killing him softly... nicely done!
520,Permanent Funeral,4.44,16oz can poured into a tulip  a- pours a clear deep orange color with a one-finger foamy white head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind  s- classic west coast style ipa aromas; resinous pine zesty grapefruit & orange and a hint of fresh cut grass. undertones of bready malt and a hint of honey  t- bold zesty grapefruit up front with some notes of tangerine to compliment. resinous pine and some grassy hop notes follow. mid-palate brings out some bready almost doughy malt. the finish gives more bold zesty and resinous hop notes that stick around on the linger  m- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a creamy slightly warming finish  o- a classic of the style that still holds up today good stuff
521,Permanent Funeral,3.79,poured from a 16 oz. can. has a foggy orange color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of pine fruits. taste is pine oranges dankness a touch of alcohol significant bitterness. feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer but didnt quite blow me away.
522,Permanent Funeral,5,love the band love the brewery. i have not had a bad beer from 3 floyds and this one does not disappoint. how could it with a collaboration with pig destroyer? at 10.5% you cant go wrong. tons of flavor but goes down smooth. i buy every 4 pack i find when it becomes available. i wish this was a year round beer!
523,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.19,is it the hops or the hopping? i like other fort points especially the citra ddh. i bought this one for the low abv but it just doesnt measure up in flavor or feel
524,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.25,3/5/2020
525,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.9,#146 yum!
526,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.47,canned 12/2/22 consumed 12/26/22  i was surprised to see that trillium did a xmas drop in the chicagoland area of fresh hazy beers so i grabbed some as soon as i could for my holiday week. i find that when someone can do a lower abv (6.6%) with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a dipa. my pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs but i need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting. i am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything. the midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side but i actually like the dryer bitter finishes more. the beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as i am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep. the feel is full and smooth. overall a great beer. i wish i had a fresh zombie dust to compare to see which would win for me.
527,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.27,nice light fluffy pale ale. i love this line of pale ales in general with the ddh being the best variant. maybe due to having the ddh version first i really expected too much of this. full disclosure this is very good. one of the best pale ales ive had and packed with a lot of flavor for a relatively smaller abv and i do love galaxy hops - but this doesnt stand up to the ddh fort point.
528,O'Doul's Amber,3.43,clear light amber with 1/2 finger of quickly-dissipating light than head.  smell is slight caramel and toffee as would be expected. good aroma just not much of it.  taste is molasses toffee bread crust tea and a bit of noble hop spiciness. almost like having the base bread for gingerbread with a glass of iced tea but much less flavor intensity and drier. moderate bitterness.  feel is light  with moderate fine sharp carbonation.  overall decent beer in an absolute sense and good for na beer. none of the unfinished wort flavor that is present in old-school na beer. the tea flavor is the only oddity but half-way through it im used to it. if i wasnt doing a review im not sure i would have specifically noticed it.
529,O'Doul's Amber,2.39,purchased in canada brewed in canada under labatt. this is probably my favourite non alcohol brew so far. nice mild malt and the subtle hop expression really seems to shine in this one. not crazy about the ingredients having glucose syrup but theres only 2g of sugar per can so it cant be much.
530,O'Doul's Amber,4.81,if youre comparing this brew to real beer dont! this is a non-alcohol brew! if you are a retired alky like me this is a godsend! it is as close to real beer as i have ever tasted. i now have something to look forward to when eating pizza or burgers. now when we go to friends for dinner i bring a 6 pack of amber and i (capital i) can drive home! thanks a/b!
531,O'Doul's Amber,4.67,great alternative and nice taste. i enjoy it during the week when you don’t need or want to drink.
532,O'Doul's Amber,1.67,i only drink this if i am a guest at someones home and they bought it for me because i do not drink alcohol. otherwise i would not buy or drink this stuff.
533,O'Doul's Amber,1.77,tuesday october 12 2021 8:18 pm 12 ounce bottle poured to wine glass sight: amber clear off white foam lacing smell: malty aroma not a lot of hoppy aroma taste: slightly bitter not a lot of taste mouthfeel: creamy slightly tart  medium body lively carbonation long finish bitter aftertaste overall: fair not ok too repeat not to look for
534,O'Doul's Amber,2.23,12oz brown bottle - review from notes  this is slightly better than regular odouls but both suffer from having little flavor and what little flavor there is is mostly funky garbage juice. but there is a bit more malt to this and id take it over the og anyday  shout out to kenny dennis
535,O'Doul's Amber,1.23,purchased as a single bottle from kroger for $.99. poured into a nonic pint glass.  l - pale very clear amber with zero head. s - whole-grain sliced bread bran flakes and deer feed. not much else. t - molasses and bran are pretty upfront and is quickly followed by a vile flavor along the lines of a musky old bread thats been left in the hot sun for two or three weeks. fairly sweet with nothing to balance it out. reminds me almost of ipecac syrup... f - thick with minimal carbonation. not easy to drink. o - it\s pretty hard to fuck up worse than the original o\doul\s but they managed to do it with this one! for the price i would pay ten times the amount for you to not make me drink this. i have a feeling it would be slightly less terrible if it was well-carbonated. i mean it\d still be awful but it\d be drinkable! i think this is the second entry of the beers i actually hate list. i highly recommend not purchasing this. it\s not worth it even if it\s less than a dollar...
536,O'Doul's Amber,3.06,(12 oz bottle code: 20223 cg0156 twist-off crown; purchased single off shelf... poured into a 14 oz mug)  l: polished-clear tawny-colored liquid; amber-tinged foam on the pour which all but disappears leaving only a razor-thin collar  s: relatively mute aroma expression... lightly-worty brown bread crust... no off-putting off-aromas; just dull  t: vienna lager-like? but one thats old and perhaps slightly oxidized... bold yet dry apple juice overtone... the aftertaste is near bone dry with a mellow caramel note most prominent also a low-moderate neutral bitterness and maybe a mild toasted bread around the edges... really it tastes almost syrup/concentrate-like  f: might as well be flat; the little tingle it lends gives a flicker of life to its coiled light body... the little bit of pudge up front swells then vanishes  o: probably not supposed to pour this in a glass?? ... i guess i should have expected such bland blandness... the code suggests this bottle is almost a year old; maybe ill take another crack at this in the future ... interesting run of na brands leading up to this milestone review (1750)
537,Three Philosophers,3.96,12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip. best by: 8/30/28  l: ruby brown mostly clear 2 finger ruddy tan head foam is rocky and spongy and persistent. s: slightly mineral light fruit aroma both dark fruit and berries chocolate malt some alcohol. t: opens rich with a hint of chocolate and dark fruit malt sweetness but is ultimately sharp tart and bitter well attenuated finish is reminiscent of bitter baker’s chocolate. f: medium-ish body smooth and frothy has a little heat o: decent sipper.
538,Three Philosophers,4.53,pours dark tan with light belgium style carbonization. malty sweat finish make this an amazing domestic belgium style strong ale.
539,Three Philosophers,4.27,dark reddish mahogany color with a respectable tan head that hangs around and produces lots of nice lacing. the aroma is raisins figs brown sugar caramel earthy with some hints of cacao. the taste is all of that and more lots of brown sugar and dark fruit a bit of allspice cherries and toffee a hint of alcohol just moderately sweet but luscious. the body is full moderate soft carbonation smooth and very drinkable. this is really a great take on a belgian quadrupel very tasty complex and enjoyable especially as an after dinner sipper or as a cold weather warmer outstanding.
540,Three Philosophers,4.16,poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass. l - pours an opaque brown color with a tan head that dissipates quickly leaving a slight ring around the glass. s - smells of dark fruits molasses and booze. t - tastes of raisins and molasses with some cherry on the finish. f - has kind of a fizzy carbonation with a medium body. o - very nice quadrupel.
541,Three Philosophers,4,pours a deep brown. light foam. nutty aroma. sweet fruity body. warm bread finish. not too sweet. smooth for a quad. makes for a great holiday beer.
542,Three Philosophers,3.92,on tap at the den at st. burch. strong but good for a frigid day.
543,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.79,kind of a cider-y small. high abv but would not assume it was an ipa nor a double ipa based on taste and smell alone.
544,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.59,12 ounce can for a dollar from trader joe’s. pours ok little head stays. stinks. it’s pretty rank on the nose. tastes unfocused and strange. a malt backbone saves it. but as the brew warmed i considered a sink pour but obliged myself to finish. glad i only got one. i don’t want another. feels kinda thick mid carbonation. overall.. yuck. not a belgian. not a double ipa. malt liquor would be a compliment.
545,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),4.08,it reminds me of a less bitter less complex version of arrogant bastard which i truly love. i would also compare this to a winter warmer another style i enjoy. i think arrogant bastard used special b malt which i dont detect in this beer. it is very malt with some pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. i would buy this again. trader joes sells this for a fantastic price for a 6 pack. this is not a hazy or juicy dipa.
546,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.5,poured 12 oz. can into neculated muffin top glass. pleasing dark amber color. seemed to have an abundant amount of lacing in the glass. about 3 fingers of head immediately developed. a couple of tastes of head alone gave me a bit of lightheadedness. faint malt aroma heavy fruitiness. taste for me was not all that appealing. mouth was smooth with a hint of bitterness at the end. i guess i am not an ipa guy. probably this is my one and only 6 pack to go.
547,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.89,ahhhh the vaulted (approximately) $0.85 iipa offering at the world famous watering hole: trader joes. expectations set to overly critical thumbs set to overdrive. here we go:  theres a number of bad reviews of this beer here on beer advocate and yes i completely see where most of them are coming from. i mean really - is this really a iipa?? wheres the citrus? wheres the pine? wheres that gorgeous gorgeous (it says 75 ibus on the can but im guessing thats a typo) bitterness? other than the abv an iipa this is not.  and a belgian? its not even that great a belgian! sure its got the sweetness and maybe it could (barely) pass the mouthful test but wheres the dark fruit complexity? wheres the depth? wheres the hooded monks slaving over a barrel of dark sumptuous gloriously syrupy ale? a belgian it clearly is not.  so then what is this monstrosity of a (about) $0.85 per can beverage? what is it? and why did i just score it 4?  boatswain double ipa 8.4% poured from can into a clear double-sided microwave and dishwasher safe coffee mug from costco.  l: it says appearance- deep amber in all caps on the can. it\s not the deepest of amber i\ve ever seen on a beer but it\s not in this is false advertising territory either. this is a pretty heavy pour - just-finished-assembling-some-furniture-and-i-want-a-beer-quick type pour. it\s got quite a bit of a head that dissipates in a fair amount of time. there is lacing on the glass so that\s a plus. under the light it\s like i said not the deepest of amber. it\s cloudy with the lightest of fizz. it\s not bad for what it is - and it\s a...  s: oooooooh. sweeeet. like peach and biscuits and a little vanilla. its malty - you can smell the sweet molasses-ey maltiness of this. its almost like a...  t: malt. malt. malt. malt sweetness hits first. im guessing they use a fair amount of crystal malt. theres a very slight hint of that peach a little banana and a little bit of that sweet vanilla that hits too. theres a little hint of that hop bitterness its there. more pine than citrus not overly complex. and then theres the aftertaste. im writing like thats a bad thing - its not. its pleasant honey sweet maybe? and it lingers for a bit. i like it personally. all things considered its a pretty straightforward ale - malt biscuit sweet with enough bitterness to balance it out. a complete letdown as an iipa but its pretty good as a...  f: im nearly at the end of this glass. relishing every last drop to fill this review in. maybe one mouthful left. instantly regretting letting my wife try some but hey a shared beer is a good beer. its syrupy like a honey lemon drink made by someone with one too many pots of honey in their kitchen. and it lingers too - in your mouth and on your lips. it clings to your throat and sinuses. or thats just the weather talking. its thick and glossy and what youd expect from a...  malt liquor. actually more like a double amber ale. i mean its got everything an amber would have but like doubled. i actually like my british style ambers with their sweet malt biscuitiness and their simplicity. and i like this beer. as an amber it does exactly what youd expect and a little more and as a malt liquor you get a complexity that very few $0.85 (about) a can a beer can get you. its easy to drink its accessible its all-round pretty good. and id probably get a few more. once i get over the expected hangover.  tldr: its less than a dollar bought at trader joes. its not chimay or pliny or whatever iipa is in fashion. but its not kingfisher strong or red horse or some bottom shelf nonsense. its a good marginally complex ale that id recommend to new drinkers whod like to try something different.
548,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.41,this is a great starting point if your not familiar with double ipas. not to strong but enough of a kick! yes there is a slight aftertaste that is kinda weird. but this is a totally drinkable beer and so affordable! give this one a taste! i will definitely buy this again! thank you trader joes!
549,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.19,i love the reviews i read for this beer i was given a 6-pack by my daughters boyfriend i think its pretty good and now that i know its so cheap i like it even better
550,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.4,this is an odd one. it tastes like a belgian ale trying really really hard to be an imperial ipa- and not a great belgian either too thin to be a belgian. almost no bitterness. not a lot of complexity in the flavors here. could be improved by picking once and for all what this beer wants to do with its life and then either adding citrus peel to make it more belgiany or more hops to make it more imperial. it does not taste double hopped but it definitely hits like a double ipa at 8.4% while also being five bucks a 6-pack at trader joes... so that does sway my review here. if it were any more expensive or tasted any worse id say its not worth it. but as its less than a dollar a can for a drinking experience that is not overtly unpleasant ill say its a good value for its price. will likely buy again next time my job cuts my hours.
551,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.04,this is my 1st attempt at submitting a rating on this site. the plethora of beer snobs and their command of beer speak on this siteis impressive. here\s my review . . . i agree with the notion that this brew\s taste is more belgian than ipa . . . nevertheless it\s in-your-face flavor is pretty good with an abv of 8.4% and a price point that can\t be beat . . . this is the perfect get buzzed quick brew btw it pairs well with most sativas ;-)
552,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.82,let me start out by saying this beer sucks. all of the boatswain beers taste awful. but given todays current inflation the price point cannot be beat. at $4.99 plus deposit and tax it’s still a great value. this is how i get around that nasty taste. just add a tsp of fresh lime juice more or less depending on taste. now you have a corona on steroids just don’t pore in a clear glass. lol
553,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.82,nice amber color but the head is massive loose bubbles like root beer or cola that lasts maybe 1 minute. no lacing. overtly malty smell and taste. unremarkable mouthfeel. much more like a badly executed belgian than any kind of ipa. my wife called it disgusting.
554,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.67,overall; this beer reminds me a lot of pyramid brewings outburst ipa. a dominating sweet malt bill. nothing citrusy about the european type hops. along with a high abv. if you like outburst you will like this beer. very much a 90s type beer...  12 oz can. no package date. poured into a pint glass  pours a light orange/honey colored body with a white head. not much retention. a few rings of speck lacing.  nose is very understated. im getting sweet malt with a tiny whiff of german style hops.  taste is very reminiscent of pyramid brewings outburst ipa. hops under the radar along with a dominating sweet malt bill  feel is appropriate for the style.  overall-see first paragraph
555,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.44,lol this would be an acceptable belgian strong ale... slap in the face if you expect a double ipa!!!
556,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),4.65,an excellent dipa. easy to drink. i enjoyed straight out of the can as well as in a glass. has a strong hoppy aftertaste that feels good in the back of the throat.
557,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.58,if you love beer you will like this one alot. not the best but not the worst. i\m not a dangle my pinky and talk about the flavor notes type. i just like beer. this one is tasty but strong and goes down easy. give it shot. you will not regret it. if you do put it back on the shelf because then there will be more for me.
558,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.61,it literally tastes like how a bandaid smells. you know what im talking about here. rubber and cotton and adhesive.  i jumped on this at tjs today -- a double ipa for $4.99? sure sign me up! the amber color of my first pour was surprising as was the nose -- rubber and alcohol. but the taste is what put this over the edge -- sweet and malty -- not anything like any double ipas ive ever tried. downright nasty actually. it has an 8.4% abv which is great and all -- if you can stomach this abomination...i cant.  even at this price point im never doing this again.
559,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,1,they make p*$$ water beer and have 10 mg thc drinks which are also trash and barely even get you high. cannot wait till this company is over and finished with.
560,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,2.25,tried this one a while back hoping that maybe i would like it better than the original. i did not just a weaker less flavored version of pbr. could have been negatively impacted by my lifelong disdain for pbr but i dont like it.
561,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,3.13,clear pale gold with three fingers of white three minute head. splotches of lace. smell is grain bin. taste is grains bread crust and a tiny bit of grassy herbal hops. mouthfeel is light with strong carbonation. finish is lightly dry and mildly bitter. overall for the style it is just o.k. drink cold for best results.
562,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,2.22,not much to really say about pabst light. looks tastes and smells like municipal water. while i wasnt expecting it to be great it still managed to disappoint me. one to get if youre in for disappointment.
563,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,3.31,pabst blue ribbon light.  ahhh yes this is quite comical. never even knew there was a light version of good ole pbr. drank about ten thousand regular ones on my college days. friend came over with a mixed thirty of  who knows what  out of his now deceased grandfathers basement. not even sure if this stuff is brewed anymore. oh well for the sake of experimentation!.  look - surprisingly deep yellow with a big frothy white head that pops and splats like soap bubbles. carbonation is fairly high as expected. head actually retained quite well and left a bit of lacing to my shock. 3.5.  smell - grains are on high much like its older brother. adjuncts are clearly apparent though do not lead the way which is always a plus. a bit of an alcoholic smell despite the low abv. 3.  taste - bit fresh bready grain ordeal going on right from the get go. adjuncts fall to the back end and youre met with that slight grape flavor pabst is typically famous for. must admit it tastes exactly like its big brother. even if this beer is old it has held up quite well. 3.5.  feel - the body is as watery and smooth as ever with a massive dosage of carbonation. feels thin even for a light lager. 2.75.  overall - im honesty more impressed than my score may lead you to believe. i will admit i have and always will have a soft spot for pbr and they managed to pack the majority of big brothers flavor and all aspects into a little brother version. cannot complain a bit . 3.5
564,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,1.45,my bottle was heavily infected. 2022. anyone else have this happen?
565,Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.33,latest batch.
566,Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.79,this is one of the best beers on the planet. my favorite beer is lou pepe kriek and while of course nothing can replace lpk this is as close as you’ll find anywhere outside of brussels.  in the spirit of ba i’m tempted to use a bunch of pretentious adjectives to describe its color flavor mouthfeel etc. but the truth is you really don’t any of that. just find it.
567,Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.6,this is an excellent christmas eve beer. first it has a great color for christmas and the cherry and warm spice taste is perfect for the holiday.  bought the bottle of this during the pandemic when it was made possible to order and pick up. this beer pours a beautiful reddish purple color with a nice effervescent white head and excellent initial curtain lacing. intense tart cherry smell and taste with warm spice flavors and a nice earthy funk. enjoyed it very much!  had the latest batch on 6/5/22 from tap at the brewery. the latest version lives up to previous. detected a bit of rich vanilla as well. really a great beer.
568,Montmorency Vs Balaton,3.96,a: pours up a murky reddish grape hue with a quickly receding white one finger head. s: immediate cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. there is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal. t: surprisingly subdued it is sour but not brutally so and the cherry is certainly there but i got some baking spice what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . there are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins. m: surprisingly full but still bone dry. o: this is an interesting beer it is much more subtle nuanced and complex than i was expecting it to be. full disclosure i’m not a real kriek/cherry sour fan so i bought this on reputation alone and while i don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek i do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. i think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. fruited sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not but i will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here i would be more inclined to buy them.
569,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.27,long time want of mine! 2016 vintage. unfortunately most of the cocoa vanilla and cinnamon has faded already. all that remains is the apple brandy and strong ancho chilies. spicy burn on finish. i’m sure it’s a shell of its former self.
570,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.17,bottle share thx to hopelessly0.
571,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.46,review was for og not rerelease.
572,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.75,this amazing beer combines tobacco peppers vanilla and what tastes like brandy into the quintessential barrel aged beer that pours perfectly and combines amazing mouthfeel carb and taste
573,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.15,2016 vintage - drank 02/24/21  smell -pleasant with notes of tobacco and chocolate  taste - the tobacco over powers this one in the beginning. and then as it warms the peppers take over. very unique taste and i think it’s the brandy barrel influence.  feel - thin and i expected more  overall - for being the #4 overall beer on ba i expected more much more. the feel was thin and notes of pepper overpowered this. yet it was not completely unenjoyable just not even close to the 4th best beer in the world. regardless glad i gut to try it as it’s always nice to see what the hype is about. this one just didn’t live up to it
574,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.23,2016 was worth it. 2014 idk man
575,Bud Ice,3.88,honestly not a bad beer. a bit bready up front but it has no offensive flavors and goes down smooth. for what it is this is a good go to cheap beer. this is budweiser 2.0 and has a much crisper finish. im a big fan of this beer and think its one of the best budget options out there. i used to be a huge ipa guy but im now coming around to the fact that beers like this absolutely have their place.
576,Bud Ice,3.55,poured from a 25oz can into a 3 floyds pint glass. pours a clear straw gold with a finger a white foam that eventually fades away. no lacing of course but it’s not a bad looking beer. smell isn’t much. neither is the taste. it has that corn product domestic lager thing going on but it isn’t terrible. almost refreshing and appreciate the abv. very carbonated on the mouthfeel. what is there to say really? this is what it is and i enjoy it here and there. it’s at least got some alcohol content to it to make it worth drinking which it is.
577,Bud Ice,2.01,this beer is sour but not like a sour beer. not that good. high alcohol for low price. feeling the economy pinch so i bought this. no smell to it. light carbonation. clean taste that ghosts pretty quick.
578,Bud Ice,3.53,i like my ipas bitter.nowadaysbrewers sell ipas to the masses that taste and smell like mangos.i dont drink mangos. i have gone back to macros for my everyday beer.this is a 5.5% beer.its tasteif cold as it meant to be drankis cleanbut carbonated.it looks dark golden(who cares?).it smells like a cheapadjunct beerbut not offensive(dont take a large whiffit aint that kind of beer).i laugh at the morons that claim that this is a get drunk beer...its 5.5%less than any micro i drink! lookits brewed by bud;say what you wantbut they know what they are doing.looking for micro-taste at this price point?againyoure a moron.this is a cheap beer that has a clean taste for an adjunct;it aint bad for what it is at all.
579,Bud Ice,3.96,the taste is good for how high alcohol content it is it is a good cheap beer its my everyday drink after work after keystone stop selling keystone eyes.
580,Bud Ice,4,darker gold than regular budweiser. soapy loose head that doesn’t linger. smells very neutral. tastes like bread crackers malted grain very little in the way of hops. crisp with a surprisingly nice aftertaste. there’s a little alcohol heat on the backend as well probably from being brewed with rice or corn syrup. i think this beer gets a bad rap because it’s cheap it also makes good micheladas if your into that.
581,Bud Ice,2.18,only picked this one up because a fresh batch of 18 oz bottles came in and i figured hell i hate budweisers line of products even after a fair shake of trying them. so may as well try this one too since im a fair guy. first one had no carb had to go get a replacement short walk. this one carbonation is fine. heyoooooooo. tastes the same as the previous bottle with no carbonation. but with bubbles. ya these things are just beer for bums to get buzzed in a blaze of time. which i think makes it good for what it is im just not lookin for it. on the ice beer scale lower in terms of choice if one had the options of course. not everyone is as fair as i.
582,Bud Ice,2.25,poured from an undated 12oz can.  on the pour a fizzy soda like head forms then quickly disappears entirely. carbonation is very lively and the color is a yellow gold.  aroma is rough. a bit of green apple off sweetness followed by a skunky note and finished by a rough bad smell that i couldnt say where it came from. smells like expired cider even ice cold.  flavor isuch better than the aroma fortunately with some malts actually present. zero hops however. a fuel and alcohol flavor is present in the very back despite only being 5.5% abv. has the same ricey light note as standard bud. not the worst bit not good. to be honest everything leading up to this had me expecting worse.  feel is light watery and has a lot of co2 bite. despite all its flaws when ice cold this beer is relatively refreshing and some head does form when sipped despite being headless in the glass. it gets the job done but its still not great.  overall this is just a cheaper stronger version of budweiser. if you like bud and are on a budget this might be fore you but mhl is the same price and scores better in every category.
583,Bud Ice,2.65,not bad for the price. not a fan of the mouthfeel but this is one of the best bangs you can get for your buck. legendary among alcoholics.
584,Bud Ice,2.96,if i’m picking one 25 ounce beer to drink it’s between this or budweiser. similar to bud in taste beechwood aged with stronger alcohol at 5.5 percent biting on your tongue overpowering. decent smell when breathing through your nose. not as enjoyable but better buzz in a pinch.
585,Bud Ice,1,drain-pour!
586,Chill Caribbean Beer,1.81,date: july 30 2022... occasion: preparing for the terrazo italiano dining experience with the first of three balashi products to sample... pours a flat sallow golden body almost devoid of bubbles with a head that swiftly dissipates to a ring of off-white head--squarely in line with beers that require limes... dish detergent lemon some astringency something akin to the garden hose and cracker malts that don\t really stir the interest much... its palate refreshes swift with a slick malt base enough effervescence to register its real ingredients and a soft simple aftertaste that cleans rather than satisfies... the flavor is as expected--a beer whose name is in terms of advertising a glittering generality is reduced to the temperature to which it is served... slammable in its 7.4-ounce bottles it doesn\t move the needle for me though maybe if i were a twenty-something set loose in aruba this might be the morning/afternoon beer that keeps me hydrated until the night arrives... for now it\s pure novelty and a donation to balashi--you can\t beat fresh home-brewed beer in that regard!
587,Chill Caribbean Beer,4,had for lunch in 7.5 oz bottle and karmina’s kitchen in san nicholas aruba. i liked it better than the balashi it had a sweeter and cleaner more refreshing taste. pilsner is not my favorite but this was ok.
588,Chill Caribbean Beer,2.79,this glorious golden beer reminds me much of a corona. that being said you must drink this with a lime otherwise it is just not great. however if you’re on the beach or chilling poolside it is refreshing to sip on!
589,Chill Caribbean Beer,3.39,my bestie brought a can of this to nashville whilst there for my sons hockey tournament. it poured a clear yellow with white head that did not leave much lace. the scent had faint grain notes. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with grain and lemon kisses. the mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. overall its a good beer.
590,Chill Caribbean Beer,3.45,poured into a pint glass via can  color is a light yellow  smell is a lager..slight malt crispness light citrus  tatse follows the nose  medium carbinationlight mouthfeel  arubas version of bud light..like balashi its not a great beer but tastes better due to the location you are drinking it
591,Chill Caribbean Beer,2.61,its a good beach beer that i would recommend not drinking anywhere but aruba. this is a pretty unique barley/rice/corn flavor very sweet. not much in the aroma. feel is a little off.
592,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.95,12 fl. oz. bottle thanks to my son steinar. abv is 7.2%. cloudy dark brown colour big and creamy tan head. very nice aroma of fruity american hops and oak blackcurrants marmelade some vinous notes too. the mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. very bitter aftertaste. an arrogant beer perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as i feared. i am worthy!
593,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.18,reviewed from notes.  pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle excellent clarity. off white foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice foamy cap.  the smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. i get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. theres enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness but there are also softer floral notes an earthiness a very slight citrus zest. the malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. spicy like cloves.  the taste delivers on whats promised by the smell. caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. this rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak floral earthy definite citrus zest resembling orange and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. no sign of the abv whatsoever. while it could be jagged everything comes together for a smooth experience.  everything lingers into the aftertaste. it\s got a nice sticky feel without being overly cloying. carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. smooth and creamy. oddly the beer feels good.  overall this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. well done.
594,Oatmeal Stout,2.91,kind of weak in smell and taste mild molasses flavour.
595,Oatmeal Stout,4.65,if only the owner wasnt such a terrible person.
596,Oatmeal Stout,4.19,from a 12oz bottle. dark brown color with a finger of fluffy brown head. roasted malt aroma. full body with moderate carbonation. rich malty flavor with a slight roasted bitterness. very good
597,Oatmeal Stout,4.52,a fantastic stout - this one i always come back to! balanced notes of chocolate oats bread and raisins.
598,Oatmeal Stout,4.28,poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a pint glass.  appearance: nearly black with a very large tan head that required a gradual pour to keep it from overflowing the glass. the head dissipated gradually leaving moderate lacing.  nose: a sweet pleasant mixture of caramel and dried fruit with slight alcohol.  mouthfeel: moderately heavy smooth slight carbonation.  attack: sweetness followed by dark roast.  finish: slight bitterness from the roast.  overall: highly drinkable true to the mild character of an english ale; i.e. not near as intense as its american oatmeal stout cousins.
599,Oatmeal Stout,3.5,this is at least 5 and maybe as old as 10 years old so ill adjust ratings as best i can. pours cola brown with reddish tinges. minimal head possibly a byproduct of the age. aroma is pretty shot. smells oxidized. taste is actually a little better than i anticipated. still some nice full roast notes. feel has become thinner with age.
600,Oatmeal Stout,4.12,appearance: pours a completely dark jet black color with a massive foamy and heavy tan head that lingers. srm of 24. (4.25)  aroma: strong aromas of bittersweet cocoa english cream some coffee roast upfront. bitter english cocoa overpowers. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of milk chocolate upfront that evolves into a bittersweet english cocoa and cream flavor. mixes with some coffee roast and milk in the middle. some hazelnut and english cream linger off the end. creamy oatmeal malt body throughout. malty mildly sweet. (4.00)  feel: medium-bodied strong carbonation. full creamy and very smooth. (4.50)  overall: not a huge fan of the style but if anyone does it right its right here. pours beautifully. classic english bittersweet aromas. the malts come through in the flavor for smooth yet bittersweet chocolate and oatmeal. then a perfectly smooth and creamy malt body. all-around one of the best oatmeal stouts. (rating: 4.12)
601,Oatmeal Stout,4.86,oh! hello there you handsome gentleman...  first encounter with a stout and it did not disappoint. picked up a 550 ml bottle at my neighborhood boozitarium. poured into a clean glass.  looks perfectly black on pour with a thick head the color of fresh cream. head dissipated fairly quickly leaving a milky halo and delicate eggshell lacing. only at the barest edges when drinking could enough light pass to show a trace of mahogany.  smell was coffee and dark chocolate. taste followed suit–strong coffee and bitter chocolate with just a hint of brown bread lurking in the wings. feel was silky-smooth.  im a fan.
602,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.17,for me this is a great change of pace beer. i drink mostly light beers but i need a change up after 3 or 4 light beers one of these stouts is a perfect change. then back to a few light beers. i love the flavor and everything else about this beer. i know this isn’t the proper wine snob way to rate a beer i just can’t do that.
603,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.4,on tap at cardinal pub & bar stavanger. pitch black colour low brown head. lovely aroma of oak roasted malts dark chocolate and coffee hints of leather. roasty flavour dark malts coffee oak hints of chocolate and liquorice. nice bitterness in the finish.
604,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.5,2017 version sampled in a short glass as a bar share at ansaris. a wonderful blended treat.
605,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.96,stumbled upon this while gazing and kept coming back to it. glad i finally decided to buy it. great mouth feel delicious taste that has the mentioned cinnamon and coffee with additional hints of berry (similar to açaí). great beer overall!
606,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.91,i didn’t know if i’ve had this before but tonight i went through my fremonts and saw i had two so....  a beer that lives up to the ratings and rankings.  2018 vintage and if this has faded i can only imagine how strong it is fresh.  pours dark frothy creamy head and persistent lacing. strong scents of cinnamon coffee and bourbon barrel over dark malt. taste is very strong flavors of cinnamon coffee dark fruit cocoa and bourbon barrel. damn does this taste good. medium bodied mouth watering a very barrel forward presence.  this is just a goddamn great beer. although i probably won’t let my second bottle get too much older as this is in prime drinking time.
607,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.41,purchased on tavour. dark caramel color. smell awakens the senses with coffee & cinnamon dominating. taste follows light bourbon an the back end. feel is medium thickness. overall a wonderful strong ale.
608,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.2,8 ounce pour - $10.00 at woodstock beer market in woodstock georgia.  appearance: presents a very dark brown-hued body with a slim scant ring of beige foam.  smell: resounding rich dark maltiness infused with cinnamon-vanilla infused sugar (subtler) coffee chocolate powder german dark bread dark syrup dark fruits (all tings dark really).  taste: sweetish dark maltiness of toasted black bread rounded roasted barley scorched raw sugars with a mellow-minded earthy woodsy quality from the spice and barrel. a pleasant agreeable spiciness particularly with the cinnamon without venturing into heavy-handed crap-can red hot candy territory. dark fruitiness a little raisiny. touches of vanilla creme dutch stroop. subtle coffee infusion. good amount of barrel character its certainly warming though never heated or hot. continued traces of fruit and spice on the silken finish.  mouthfeel: medium-plus body. low carbonation. smooth supple mouthfeel.  overall: enjoyable.
609,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.39,2022 vintage. poured from a waxed 22oz bomber into a snifter.  clear bistre kissed seal brown liquid topped by a lasting event-horizon of desert sand. thick fine lacing; shimmering sticky panes of tears; excellent retention.  champurrado cocoa cinnamon and earthy coffee with a hints of kretek in the nose. very mild.  intense palate entry heavy/sharp sweetness with waves of blackstrap coffee walnuts black currant and fig. moderate earthy bitterness washed away by the alcohol (hints of rum and irish whiskey and port more than bourbon) and spice notes in the long medium finish. low tartness with hints of oak comes and goes.  rich creamy medium-full bodied with low astringency and good round carbonation. a tiny bit hot perhaps.  an interesting base beer not overwhelmed by adjuncts though quite coffee-forward at the moment.
610,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.79,look: black with a thin mocha head  smell: rich malts back up with bourbon a nice coffee note that is strong but not overpowering a bit of dark fruit  taste: very similar to the smell a great medley of flavors that come together for something greater  feel: smooth and velvety
611,Boatswain American IPA,1.51,as evidenced by the abundance of negative reviews this beer certainly is not worth experiencing for a refined palate. it definitely has both in terms of taste and smell a metallic cheap odor. however the value with which one can purchase this beer - less than 5 bucks for a 6 pack at trader joe\s - should be taken into consideration. if you don\t mind sipping on some horsesh*t beer that gets you buzzed after a few swigs this is the perfect way to enjoy a saturday afternoon with friends at a beach or at a cookout.
612,Boatswain American IPA,1.06,not good! it’s too bad trader joe’s lost the mission street brand. it was much better than this. will not be buying again.
613,Boatswain American IPA,1,nasty
614,Boatswain American IPA,1.07,this is not only the worst ipa ive ever had but one of the worst beers ive ever had. it tastes and smells like a cleaning product. it tastes like its made with the lowest possible quality adjuncts like the same kind that they make really cheap malt liquor out of and the worst possible quality hops known to man.  stay far away from this beer and the other trader joes boatswain brand beers. its a crime that they discontinued their mission street brand ales which were actually good and replaced it with the beyond awful boatswain beer.
615,Boatswain American IPA,5,well its 2022. with beer prices up 35% i refuse to be gouged by breweries just to have a cold one. and ive gotten over brewpubs that dont properly carbonate their beers starting at $6 a pint. this stuff has an alcohol content of 6.7%  an ibu of 79 and costs $4.99 for a 6 pack. bingo!  ps  i drink beer to cool off in the summertimeand get a nice buzz at the same time not have a mouthgasm. when i drink a beer i don\t use phrases like banana and clove in abundance to describe it. a good loud burb will suffice.
616,Boatswain American IPA,3.11,definitely not an aipa but as an english esb not bad. i am not getting the metallic or medicinal taste that others have but the bitterness of both the amber malt and the hops makes it taste like an amber ale. absolutely worth the price for students looking for something other than pbr or coors. they should look into brewing a mild just get rid of these hops they dont add to the flavor one bit.
617,Boatswain American IPA,2.34,12oz can from trader joes. light amber pour with a short-lived fizzy head. aroma is malty and sweet. taste is also malty with metallic notes. taste like youre licking the can.
618,Boatswain American IPA,1.06,honestly one of the more disgusting beers i have ever tasted--medicinal like a cleaning product. so bad i am taking the time to look up and contribute my own review. returning the rest of the 6 pack to trader joes tomorrow. i hope the smell and taste fade sooner than later not to mention my upset stomach from just a few sips.
619,Boatswain American IPA,1.38,just not a good ipa
620,Boatswain American IPA,3.02,from can.. $4 and change six pack at trader joes (rhinelander brewing company} -smell is good -appearance is a little cloudy for an ameican ipa -feel ..i didnt enjoy holding in mouth for long .. on the slightly hoppy side with balanced malt ....decent enough for the price.
621,Boatswain American IPA,2.89,trader joes pickup they really do a good job with variety and weird proprietary stuff always have super under the radar i reckon but its neat to know i can roll in here anytime and find something ive never had before that might only be available in their stores and the price is always right. this was under a buck for the single i think thankfully because its not worth any more than that thats for sure. its real malty almost tastes like an extract brew rather than an all malt one which is shocking really for something marketed as craft at first i was kind of bummed about it but my wife pointed out that if you consider it like a malty english pale rather than an american ipa it has some redeemable qualities. the grain is nutty and sweet amaretto and light brown sugar character caramelized some and the hops are more aromatic than flavorful there is just a moderate late bitterness that comes in decidedly old school in terms of recipe and pretty uninspired to me. it has a very weird aftertaste chemicals and malt extract syrupy feel but with some bubbles too fine to try i guess as something new but i wont be back for more of this. hoping the others in the lineup are better ill get around to trying them all eventually. as a budget beer this might work for some in a certain context but smack in the middle of fresh hop season in northwest this is an embarrassment...
622,Boatswain American IPA,1.94,wouldnt buy again. for $5/6 pack give it to your guests you dont like
623,Boatswain American IPA,2.88,12oz can no date just a stupid code  hard pour big foam dark amber and cloudy some very pretty lacing left on the glass. smells like rust water and alcohol. tastes like heavy malts and aromatic bittering hops. pine is the defining hop characteristic but theres not a ton of it this is mostly a malt bomb apart from the bitterness. has that classic minhas brewery diacetyl butterscotch burnt bandaid aroma/taste. as it warms it begins to taste worse and worse drink cold  this isnt for the west-coast hop heads - more of an old-head classic representative of the style. and at $5 a sixer how can you even begin to be critical?!
624,Boatswain American IPA,1,prominent hand sanitizer flavor with notes of old varnish & rancid malt. not sure i even want to cook with this. positive marks: the can makes for good recycling.
625,Boatswain American IPA,1.06,this is not an ipa.  this tastes like someones first batch of homebrew. and it was really warm where it fermented. banana and clove in abundance.
626,Saint Lamvinus,5,this was drank almost a week ago at vítor claros home - the winemaker from portalegre behind the dominó and claro & ferreira brands.  trying to review this from the top of my mind.  poured from the bottle to a stemmed wine glass.  a: the body is dark purple with a light purple almost pinkish head. created a generous foam quantity that lasted quite a while before jumping in. s: the aroma is actually perfect without any overpowering acidity. its balanced as it is sweet savory and acidic to the right point. its a great beer only by smelling it. t: its the taste of heaven. i think that after foufoune this might be my favorite cantillon beer. its perfectly balanced with the sweet notes from the grain and the grapes embracing quite well the light fruitiness and very light bitterness of aged hops combined with just the right amount of acidity incoming from brettanomyces. its really great with nothing to point to as a downside. m: body has just the right feel being light with the cool effervescence and silky tones from the sweetness you can find in this beer. bitterness is low. acidity is mild. o: as said before this ranks at the top of my favorite beers. unbelievably good.
627,Saint Lamvinus,4.3,on tap at armsby abby  great red counterpoint to vigneronne. huge barnyard funk in the aromas with a bit of red wine coming through in the back. tart tannic and winey in the flavors. maybe a bit vinegar-y but thats how it is with cantillon. basically the liquid equivalent of farmhouse cheese  86/100
628,Saint Lamvinus,4.22,(~5 oz tiny snifter draft pour at monks for zwanze day 2022... review copied from scant notes taken on my phone)  band aid plum powder malty lipsmacky fuller bodied  what i can add from memory: for me this is the one from that first flight that had the most personality and i think my drinking buddy would agree he being a luster of red wine... i believe this beer poured near brilliantly clear making its reddish-purple hue more vibrant and alluring mwahaha... its slight phenolic note definitely hits first and firm while its fruity flavors take a few moments to surface... the plum flavor for me wasnt so much fresh fruit as it was a ghostly concentrate essence of floral fruity aromatics lingering in the background... would love to try it again from a bottle (2039)
629,Saint Lamvinus,4.24,pours a rich deep purple brief pink head that settles to a thin ring light lacing. taste is tart fruit up front balanced by a mild noble hop character (mushroom earth grass); lots of lingering oak barrel character as well. feel is crisp and clean. a very good expression of both grape and barrel without letting these elements overwhelm.
630,Saint Lamvinus,4.39,on tap at armsby abbey  welp i inadvertently ended up here for zwanze day! i was at a show right down the road at palladium and figured i’d come here after only to find some true whales of mine. it’s finally time to see what their grape lambic is all about  pours a clear reddish purple with a finger of light pink head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  it’s quite soft in the nose but there’s still the requisite funk. i’m picking up on aromas of red wine vinegar lemon juice wheat bread wet hay stone and sharp oak  there’s more bite to it in taste but conversely less grape. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting wildflower honey lemon juice straw apple skin red grape light toasted oak and a hint of cherry. the swallow brings notes of lemon zest wet hay sharp oak red wine vinegar crabapple light blueberry and pear skin  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a sharp beer. finishes bone dry and tart  damn this is awesome stuff. not quite on par with fou foune but it’s always nice to try cantillon
631,Saint Lamvinus,4.84,2019 bottle  consumed 8/12/22  i love the funk and balance of tartness and dryness. a superb fruited lambic.
632,London Porter,4.27,poured from a 500ml bottle. poured a deep red  almost black with a tight bubbled chocolate head . the smell is coffee and then chocolate and the tastes follows exactly with bitter notes and a slight sweetness. the mouthfeel is good coats the tongue fizzy  spot on really. overall a really good beer  deep rich and satisfying as they come .
633,London Porter,4.17,pours a deep dark mahogany coloration with a ruby sheen when held up the light and a medium creamy head. smells of bready roasted malt and chocolate with just a hint of herbal hops as well. taste is a great balance of roasted slightly caramelly malt milk chocolate much lighter dark/red fruit with notes of raisin and cranberry and just a hint of coffee licorice and earthy herbal hops. finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt chocolate and licorice lingering in the aftertaste. smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  this makes for a very nice english porter with distinct notes of roasted malt and chocolate and a great balance of sweet roasted and bitter notes with the roasted and bitter notes clearly dominating just like i like it. hints of drak/red fruit coffee and licorice add a certain depth while earthy herbal hops provide that certain bitterness to this. its just a very well-balanced easy drinking yet flavorfull example of the style with a good body and mouthfeel for the style as well.
634,London Porter,4.24,quite simply the best porter ever made. still the g.o.a.t. after all these years.
635,London Porter,4.16,11.2 oz bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. pours a dark brown slight darker than cola with some ruby highlights. thin tan head falls quickly to some whisps of foam. smell is roasted malt coffee chocolate and a bit of hops. taste starts with coffee and chocolate up front then a bit of bitterness and roasted malt. finishes with a bit of earthiness and a long coffee/chocolate aftertaste. feel is smooth and easy drinking. medium-light mouthful with nice carbonation that remains present yet soft. overall i am enjoying this beer a lot. easy to drink flavorful manageable abv when having more than one or two. will buy again especially if i can find it relatively fresh for an english import.
636,London Porter,4.25,l: very dark chestnut colour good head and lacing s: chocolate toffee roastiness t: toast chocolate dark fruit s: quite well-bodied balanced carbonation  o: 4.25
637,London Porter,4.93,12 oz bottle that states best before 6/1/21 poured into a tulip glass at approx 55 degrees f: l - dark as coal with a caramel head that quickly disappeared s - roasted malt coffee toffee t - roasted malt flavor toffee coffee and a bit of nuttiness f - silky smooth with minimal carbonation o - very very robust flavor this is a classic porter
638,London Porter,4.02,cola colored with a hint of red and an 1/8 of an inch of tan head that disappears quickly. very subdued nose that has roasted malts some cocoa and coffee. the taste follows the nose but expansive. more of the roasted malt cocoa and coffee with a bitter coffee finish. its a little thin but fine. this beer is easy to drink and enjoyable.
639,London Porter,4.13,dark cordovan appearance with a loose tan head with good retention and decent lacing. bitter roasty coffee chocolate bread malt. medium body pleasant carbonation.
640,Schmidt,2.9,does anyone remember schmidt city club? that was a decent quaff.
641,Schmidt,2.52,this was a beer that i remember from my service days when i was stationed in texas and oklahoma. got it from a friend along with many other brands that he picked up for me along the way when he drove up to visit. beer tasted like i remembered it not something to get excited about but it will quench a thirst when you need it.
642,Schmidt,2.74,this rant review is in honor of 1980 nl mvp mike schmidt... how did i see this beer in a variety of locations over the last 10 years but now on a day when i visit the damn neighborhood where the brewery used to stand i cant find a single can. they gave the bar at the fire a new snazzy coat of paint but no longer do i see schmidt breweriana on the walls or cans in the their fridge... none of the other joints in the vicinity had it. shame on you garage with all your canned dreams to not include a row for dear old schmidt... i will find you soon i know i will and ill do a proper review even though i already know what you probably taste like... the above number ratings are based on schmidts 1979 stats. im sure his namesake beer smells of an 8 but i cant bring myself to give an overall 1... dont mind me... just delirious playing with digits. (1980)
643,Schmidt,2.88,pours a crystal-clear straw yellow with a thin short lived white cap. aroma is corn and biscuity. flavor follows the nose when ice cold its a very modest priced refresher after drinking higher quality beers. i mean to say that theres nothing wrong with saving a few bucks after the taste buds are as buzzed as the rest of you. feel is crisp and well carbonated. overall not a beer to write home about but now that im retired a cheap beer now and then works for me.
644,Schmidt,3,i remember it being a decent beer for the money on a hot summer day. the 12-packs had the various sportsmen outdoors fishing and hunting motifs on the cardboard and the cans. it was an okay beer for the budget-minded (cheap). about 4 bucks a 12-pack back in the 80s. definitely a light beer. ice cold its crisp and unassuming with not much of an aftertaste.
645,Schmidt,4.32,decent basic lager. crisp clean refreshing and tastes good. biscuity. nicely blended hops. medium to light body. dry finish. not sweet
646,Schmidt,3.09,a middle-of-the-road adjunct lager. poured from 12-ounce can into a vintage hollow-stemmed goblet mainly for looks. a center pour yielded a nice two-finger white head atop a clear pale-yellow body. decent retention some nice lacing and good carbonation. thats about it. aromas and flavors of corn grassy hops and tart cider. light in body not much bitterness. a little bit of fruity tartness lingers on the finish. overall not much here to offend the taste buds and the olfactory senses.
647,Schmidt,4.84,when i was farming i grew cereal grains soybeans corn sunflowers and more. schmidt doesn\t taste or smell like corn! when you\re combining storing augering or hauling barley you know what it smells like. how many of you have been in the dust; it itches like heck! as a trucker i hauled malted barley from moorhead & shakopee mn to anhesuser-busch in baldwinsville ny houston tx & stroh\s brewery in n.j. years ago i toured red hook in woodinville wa too; ugh the coffee one was well like coffee. i\ve hauled pearled feed and needles barley. i know breweries and i know barley. i drink schmidt because it has an aftertaste. i drink it because it isn\t a water-flavored beer. i slayed the big mouth bottles back in the day. i\ve sent emails to pabst about bringing the big schmidty back but to no avail. in my ratings i don\t believe in rating the look or the feel what for? how many of you rate the beer based upon the 2 row or 6 row barley varieties? is it good in a can yes; is it good it a bottle absolutely! how would i change it? i\d add just a little more hops flavor. love you all but i love schmidt more.
648,Schmidt,2.68,from a 12oz can $4.99 for a 6 pack:  appearance: clear yellow ok head.  smell: mild corn.  taste: mix of mild sweet corn and a slight sourness. it would be fine but then gives a butyric twinge.  overall: continuing a mini-tour of sub-premium lagers schmidt used to be made in st. paul and some signs can still be seen outside dive bars advertising it. my can had a bear on it. beer wasnt bad but wasnt too good either with a weird sour note to it.
649,Schmidt,4.11,drank from a 12 ounce can. scores are based on the style.  look - the can is a vibrant red with a deer on it. its a very honest and masculine can. the schmidt logo would look good as a sticker in the back window of a pickup.  smell - light and corny simple and airy. a classic smell.  taste - crisp and refined. not too sweet not too earthy. a really nice balanced flavor. better than a lot of bigger name aals.  feel - thin and still. could use a bit more pep in its step though.  overall - i had never heard of or seen this beer before just bought a case on a whim. its way better than i expected. its a simple casual drinker i could go through a lot of this.
650,Schmidt,1.24,i’d rather drink keystone light
651,Irish Breakfast Ale,4.5,pours a clear amber. thin foam. strong maple aroma. big maple and coffee body. smooth creamy finish. delicious from start to finish. i could definitely drink a few of these for breakfast.
652,Irish Breakfast Ale,4.19,16 oz can picked up as part of a wegmans mix-6. poured into a willi becher glass. pours a gorgeous mahogany reddish brown with a big fluffy light tan head. good retention not much lacing. aroma and flavor feature maple coffee and caramel in that order with just a hint of smoke. overall its a tasty beer that is appropriately named (although no i did not have this for breakfast - but maybe i should have!) and very drinkable. i appreciate the low abv as well. i would pick this up again and will be on the lookout for more resurgence brews next time im in the area.
653,Irish Breakfast Ale,4,the beer pours a thin ruby brown color with a tall fast fizzy head and no lacing.  the smell is like candy. there is a ton of maple and vanilla with strong hints of coffee. its like a really sweet caramel macchiato.  the taste brings the coffee forward on the front but the finish is all pancakes with syrup. there is a ton of maple in this beer. im guessing @wesmantooth can taste it from where he is.  the mouthfeel is thin and fizzy but expected based on the look and abv.  overall this is delicious. its like breakfast in a glass.
654,Irish Breakfast Ale,3.77,poured into a mug the appearance was a mostly dark red color with a fingers worth of white foamy head that dissipated evenly to leave some sliding messy lace. the aroma had some sweet maple up front light cocoa powder some caramel/toffee malt tones and then a little bit of the sweeter side of coffee. the flavor was mainly sweet through the blend of the prior mentioned aromas to coincide in the aftertaste. the mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionable to sipping quality about it. seemed like some of the maple wanted to show a little bit of cloying but honestly it wasnt too distracting. abv did feel appropriate. overall as an irish red ale well it somewhat works id say it definitely looks like one. but personally i have to give it up to resurgence to outfit a style barely anyone tends to like any more to a modernized and fun sort of way. id still have this again.
655,Irish Breakfast Ale,4.4,look: mohagany redish with nearly zero head smell: straight coffee and maple syrup nothing else... very straight forward and delicious. taste: coffee followed by smooth malt and finishes with maple syrup the syrup isnt sugary just really smooth feel: very smooth slightly thin body easy to drink
656,Irish Breakfast Ale,4.47,pours a dark red small head light lace. great maple smell with a smokey maple taste. very light and easy to drink. as usual another perfect seasonal beer by resurgence
657,Irish Breakfast Ale,4.48,one of this up and coming breweries finer beers. had on tap at the brewery and took a 22oz home. strong notes of maple and coffee. the taste mirrors this. very straight forward and pleasant mouth feel. a terrific concept art work on the bottle is really cool as well. highly recommended try. they hit the nail on the head with this one.
658,Labatt Ice,3.51,its not a bad beer by any means but fairly cheap looking tasting and smelling. the feeling is smooth and vibrant saving it from falling below average.
659,Labatt Ice,3.45,l: standard straw yellow lager color. head looks okay but fades away quick. s: hard to really smell much. malt a bit of alcohol and the usual corn adjuncts. t: possibly the most well rounded of the macro ice beers. corn grassy hops you can taste a bit of alcohol and the sweetness but not offensive. you get a hint of the sour aftertaste like milwaukees best ice etc. but much less strong. it has a bit of that soy sauce taste you get in stronger beers which i like. not overwhelmed by corn sweetness or sour aftertaste. f: less carbonated than some ice beers. very refreshing and easy to drink. overall: definitely one of the best for the category. a very solid go-to for cheap beer enthusiasts.
660,Labatt Ice,2.58,american brewed faint lacing. 1 finger rapidly fading head. taste of adjunct beer with a splash at the finish of vodka. not very good priced accordingly. this is one whole dollar cheaper than a weaker imported labatt bleue single
661,Labatt Ice,2.46,the local beer store has been really good about single purchases of their beers and this was another that i picked up. poured into a clear glass and the color was a light golden with a small white head. the smell was beer-like nothing really special. taste was okay and not as good as i expected. would i drink it again? sure but i can’t say that i would seek it out.
662,Labatt Ice,2.5,24oz can. poured out a clear straw-yellow color with a small fizzy white head of bubbly foam. it left no lacing at all. it smelled of caramel grains corn and some grassy notes. sweet caramel and grain taste with a bitter bite. crisp and sharp.
663,Labatt Ice,2.2,purchased as a single bottle from the nearest citgo for $1.99. poured into a nonic pint glass.  l - clear gold with a minimal pale white head. s - corn flakes biscuit and grass. t - follows nose exactly. finish is very clean. f - light-bodied; well-carbonated. super drinkable. refreshing. o - its a cheap macro with simple flavors and barely a smell. however this is one of the more palatable ones. id put this on-par with natty ice or bud ice but there are definitely better macros for the price point that fit the vibe of this one. probably wont buy again but its not too bad.
664,Labatt Ice,3.15,embarking on an adjunct adventure lately seeing if i can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests pbr for my taste buds. this one is pretty decent - no offensive smells or flavors. a light-bodied easy-drinking bready malt but not as good as labatt blue all-around.
665,Labatt Ice,3.36,24oz can stamped b19127 poured into a becher glass at fridge temp 5.6% abv. the beer pours bright light golden in color with off white head. the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. minimal lacing. the aroma is faint with vague corny and grainy notes. the taste is semisweet corn plus stewed mixed vegetables and vegetable oil. minimal bitterness and a hint of tart. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and somewhat dry finish. overall not great but it appears to be over two years old from the stamp. id drink again in the right setting with a fresher sample.
666,Labatt Ice,3.36,it is a canadian adjunct lager that you can only get in canada. if you are in america you will only be able to get the brewed in america water grain and freeze method. this is watching hockey or football beer. this is a summer and it is a hot day or oktoberfest is over. or your hockey team made it to the playoffs. not sure why it is only getting a 65 but i liked it! it is smooth drinkable and has taste notes of adjuncts. the maple leaf on the front fools americans into buying a 30 pack for dirt cheap calling it canadian and even making a joke about the metric system saying eh or cracks about geese moose and maple syrup.
667,Labatt Ice,2.67,not better than normal labatt blue. dont believe the reviews. the smell is strange.
668,Labatt Ice,3.4,okay so as the first ice brewed beer ever made i have to give it props.  that being said i put this in the freezer but the alcohol content isnt nearly enough to keep it from completely freezing. i dont understand the purpose of an ice beer if it cant be served ice cold.  anyway it is reasonably priced.  the flavor is pretty standard for an ice beer. better tasting than milwaukees best ice.  im not really a fan of ice brewed beer especially keystone ice but this one is tolerable for what its worth.  it\s nothing to write home about. just an ice brewed beer or how they say in the frenchy part of canada bière.
669,Labatt Ice,3.67,ok so ice beer look strong amber appearance. smell mellow slight red wine smell as well as aftertaste almost has a mouth feel of a dry red wine. taste compared to a lot of other iced beers does not have a strong alcohol after taste. mouth feel is average. above average.
670,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.49,16iz can from tavour. hazy yellow pour one finger fluffy white head. ripe fruity aroma orange pineapple. taste is juicy grapefruit orange pineapple creamy zesty. so full so tasty.
671,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.43,a - pours a cloudy golden orange with a two finger creamy white head. heavy amount of soapy lacing.  s - aroma is mango peach guava and grapefruit.  t - the taste is mango pineapple tangerine lychee grapefruit bready malts and light bitter finish.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. creamy mouthfeel with a big crisp finish.  o - touch notch neipa.
672,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.53,poured from a 16oz can into a p3 pixel density nordic pint glass. pours a hazy light orange with a finger of firm white foam. leaves decent lacing. lots of fresh citrus on the nose and taste. like fresh-squeezed oranges plus candied oranges with just a hint of pine on the finish. just bitter enough but insanely drinkable for 8.5%. thick full mouthfeel start to finish. this is a fantastic ddh dipa.
673,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.54,poured into a 13 oz teku glass canned on 3/13/23. pours a very attract hazy yellow with a finger sticky white head that thin streaks of lace with excellent retention. 4.75  aroma is passionfruit mango tangerine and apricot. 4.5  taste follows passionfruit mango tangerine and apricot very well balanced. 4.5  mouthfeel is above average not sticky or dry soft gentle almost creamy carbonation and at 8.5% plenty of flavor but really easy sipping. 4.75  overall other half is as good as anyone at this style. pretty amazing stuff. 4.5
674,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.15,pours a hazy layer but golden straw. the aroma is incredible on this. mango pineapple even cold this omits the best of citra hops. unfortunately it’s a little flat n the flavor. even letting it warm it kind of under delivers. in fact this felt a little thin. i’ll revisit and rereview but this was a little disappointing.
675,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,3.23,this one is just over 3 months old so it’s kind of like showing up to the super bowl at half time ya feel me? and when you get there it’s pregnant rhianna (not last year where the weeknd brought the thunder). yeah it’s ok. but there’s also a perfume element that isn’t a cool equation like walter white during a cook.  the more i drink. the more it stink. heavy bad perfume all over.
676,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.48,032719: ohbc brooklyn 032919: ohbc brooklyn 031923 cod 010623 thank you blake.
677,Rodenbach Alexander,4.22,750 ml corked & caged bottle from the lcbo; best before 03/01/2021 and served slightly chilled.  pours a clear purplish burgundy colour shining ruby red when held to the light. less than a finger of frothy off white-coloured head fizzles within ninety seconds or so soon reduced to a sickly thin collar and an islet of film on the surface. the aroma is a fragrant blend of balsamic red wine vinegar sour cherries oak and mild barnyard funk with further suggestions of cherry juice cranberry and vanilla.  fruity at the forefront with black cherry sweetness giving way to red wine balsamic vinegar and sour cherries by mid-sip. notes of vanilla oak cherry juice and mild funk develop on the tail end with mild wine vinegar acidity cherry pit and sour cherries lingering into the aftertaste. not particularly funky at least not by rodenbach standards. light-medium in body with average carbonation that rolls across the tongue supplying a light frothiness to this brews smooth soft mouthfeel. regular imbibers of rodenbach as well as kriek enthusiasts should be able to finish this bottle themselves without too much trouble but its always better to share.  final grade: 4.22 an a-. alexander strikes me as a mellower lighter less complex version of their caractère rouge which is clearly the superior product imo. on the other hand alexanders cherry flavours do pop quite nicely making for a surprisingly refreshing pick on this cool late summer evening. a poor cellaring candidate especially compared to most of rodenbachs other beers but it does seem to hold up ok in the short-term (i.e. 3 years or less). a genuinely solid red ale - much like caractère rouge i think this would serve quite well as an introduction to flemish reds.
678,Rodenbach Alexander,4.65,look: moderately hazy reddish-brown hue with a thick cream-colored head with just a hint of pinkish red. fairly significant lacing and a very slow dissipation to the head.  smell: it has that red wine-esque aroma that all of the truly great flanders red ales have. theres a minor hint of fruit but the aroma is dominated by the ale itself.  taste: the excellent quality flanders red ale dominates up-front. taste of malt oak red wine vinegar plus that distinctive flanders red taste that is hard to pin down in words. the sour cherry starts to become apparent next with a lingering sweet cherry on the aftertaste. the lingering sweet cherry is surprising and pushes right up to the edge of being too much like cough syrup but it never quite crosses the line and gives this a truly unique and distinctive taste. both the sour and sweet cherry become more apparent as the beer warms.  feel: fairly highly carbonated light body overall.  overall: theres a reason this is a world-class beer. the ale itself is truly top notch but what pushes this over the edge is the unique blend of sour and sweet cherry that i have never encountered in any other beer ive tried.
679,Rodenbach Alexander,4.47,a 750ml corked and caged bottle. poured into a tilquin stemmed glass.  appearance: a nice clear maroon red colour with a half finger beige head that dissipated fairly quickly white leaving only sparse lacing.  aroma: tart cherry strawberry oak with notes of vanilla and fruit vinegar.  taste: lightly sour sweet cherry strawberry oak and fruit vinegar.  mouthfeel: light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  overall: good enjoyable aroma and flavours that is balanced and very fruity. my preference is still caractère rouge though.
680,Rodenbach Alexander,4.15,330 ml bottle poured into a tulip.  l: hazy red-hued brown 2 finger pink head fizzy foam has moderate retention lively pour. s: nose is mild but pleasant light berry rainwater and spicy hop aromas. t: medium-high lactic sweetness no bitterness notes of red fruit (cherries/berries) hint of oak finishes sour with the sweetness drying quite a bit. f: light bodied smooth and slightly soft hardens a bit toward the finish no bite somewhat chewy. o: good never gets too sour for my palate and remains easy to drink seems similar to a fruit lambic.
681,Rodenbach Alexander,4.37,rodenbach alexander pours a reddish/brownish color with lots of bubbles and not much head. the aroma is the tart cherry. the flavor is big tart and prominent sweet cherry notes almost candy-like that linger just a bit on the palate. great feeling. overall a sweeter flanders red with a tart kick. lots of cherry flavors.
682,Rodenbach Alexander,4.42,poured from 330ml bottle into my beeradvocate teku.  appearance: rich amber-ruby hue with a clear body and a thin layer of frothy foam that is perhaps light tan with a hint of pink. pretty!  smell: rich aroma with a hint of sourness and wonderful cherry character. its just sweet enough to be very candylike; im super duper into it.  taste: holy cow its even more candylike than the aroma! the extra tartness in the flavor combined with the sweetness and cherry give almost a jolly rancher like character to this thing. that said theres definitely malt underneath the candy. is there such a thing as *too* much candy in a beer like this? i am not sure but if there is this might be approaching it. still -- very good indeed.  mouthfeel: medium body with a nice carbonation and a good creaminess. it comes together well.  overall: i mean this beer is definitely my speed. i love cherry and i love flemish beers so really this ticks a lot of boxes for me. its extremely good but i want to say its almost too much even for me. so excellent if not transcendent.
683,Rodenbach Alexander,4.29,production date is difficult to decipher - october 2021? consumed on 12/30/2022. poured from a 330ml bottle into my rodenbach flute.  cloudy old rose body with auburn highlights and a lasting ivory collar and faint surface slick. fine sandy lacing; delicate legs.  fruit forward aroma fairly vinous (like fine aged balsamic with a hint of blood orange) with a complex sweet graininess.  intensely juicy palate entry suffused with pressed cherry juice orange blossom honey and an almost savory malt note. light acidity (more from fruit than lacto) very little oxidation; faint cocoa plum vanilla and rosewater. medium finish with hints of apple and raspberry. vague hops diacetyl and oak all complimentary to the malt base and ongoing fruit.  creamy medium-bodied sufficiently carbonated.  was expecting much more acidity (and more tannins) but this is nearly a dessert beer given the prominence of smooth (almost artificial/jolly rancher like) fruit flavor.
684,Rodenbach Alexander,5,poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a champagne flute because it seemed like the right thing to do. not much left to be desired with this one. slightly hazy dark reddish orange with a bright reddish-orange highlight and a pinkish head that settled to a beautiful ring. tart funky and fruity with a cherry jolly rancher thing going on. medium bodied with a slightly oaky finish with lingering notes of tart cherry. overall it just doesnt get much better than this. highly recommended.
685,Rodenbach Alexander,4.68,i really like the rodenbach caractère rouge so i thought id give the rodenbach alexander a try.  look – looks a lot like the caractère rouge with just a bit more head. a beautiful clear amber red with a head that doesnt last very long.  smell – a nice cherry scent that isnt overly sour. also oak and flanders funk. this smells really nice!  taste – the taste is very much like the smell. not sour at all. in fact this is the first sour that i think could use just a bit more sourness though i much prefer this to overly sour sours. a bit dry but very good.  feel – a nice carbonation. very easy to drink.  overall – this is another great beer from rodenbach. im generally not a huge fan of this style of beer because its usually too sour for my liking but this one is nice.
686,Rodenbach Alexander,4.5,murky reddish brown with a little fast fading head.  smells of musky oak apple cider vinegar dusty cellar and balsamic.  the taste follows the nose but is a balance of puckering sour and sweetness. cherries are in there as well.  thick and acidic somewhat woody texture with moderate to low carbonation.  i got this a long time ago somewhere in north america probably the usa likely california. brought it to phuket with me over 18 months ago where i’m drinking during our second covid quarantine june 21st 2022. great brew survived a lot but not this time of isolation!
687,Rodenbach Alexander,4.49,cloudy sark redbrowncranberry appearance. plenty of effervescent champagne like carbonation with maybe just a hair above average body. aroma is fresh black cherriescherry juicered winevinegarwoodearthy bread.. flavor is sweeter than expected but definitely is sour along with tartness and a little funk.. similar to aroma but its dryer than expected but very pleasant. overall this is an excellent top notch beer that even if you dont like sour beer this might still be enjoyable
688,Bourbon County Brand Stout,5,goose island bourbon county imperial stout.  now i must say this is quite quite good. like very good. somewhere between a good stout and an aged whiskey which isnt a surprise based on the drink itself. that being said it does not exemplify the thing i like most about beer so far being drinkability. i do like the refreshing nature of a beer quite a bit and that is the only thing id say is absent here.  at 14.3 percent its quite high for a beer and you feel a lingering alcohol taste towards the end. it is accompanied by some sweet notes like date and chocolate though.  mouthfeel is very unique in that somehow the bubbles feel thick. like the consistency is buttery and but the bubbles feel heavy for some reason bringing out a very odd and unique but not off putting almost soupy texture. mouthfeel end notes are sticky and also a little velvety or caramel-like.  smell is a little sour and very malt forward slightly fruity and even slightly-er herby.  if you havent tried it i highly recommend. ive been sipping as i write this and am appreciating it more and more. one hell of a beer. if you do grab one the only thing i can say is that its not smashable but should be enjoyed slowly.
689,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.86,finally getting to try this. 2022 vintage poured from bottle into a snifter.  look: black-brown-red thick oily. very thin light brown head no retention except a tiny ring.  smell: oh wow. damn this is pulling no punches. chocolate coffee caramel malt bourbon dark bread and the tiniest hints of vanilla beans raisins and bananas. incredibly complex.  taste: yuuuuup. heavyweight but incredibly smooth at the same time. lots of the chocolate with the vanilla bean and caramel notes playing second and third fiddle. heavy maltiness and bourbon character but still incredibly smooth with very little burn for the abv. raisin note is slightly present in the back as well as the faintest banana peeking through once the malt onslaught begins to fade.  feel: thick but only slightly oily on the palette light but lingering carbonation. sticks around a bit but in a pleasant way and doesnt overstay its welcome. very slightly syrupy. really pleasant.  overall: masterclass of an imperial stout. has more distinct flavour impressions than most stouts with adjuncts but is still perfectly balanced. deserves the hype.
690,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.45,opened the 2019 bottle that has been aging in my cellar. poured into a tulip glass. the chocolate colored head quickly dissipated. midnight color smell was extraordinary complex consisting of a beautiful bouquet of chocolate alcohol fine whiskey and espresso. taste was exceedingly complex. the stout lingered on my palate forever it seemed. take your time to sip this beauty as it has a high alcohol content. overall a warm stout to enjoy in the midst of a winter storm near a fireplace. well done.
691,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.65,2022.  a- pours a beautiful black oily color perfectly opaque. hardly any head  s-wow. rich chocolate plums oakespresso a bit of whiskey. probably the best smelling beer i’ve had the pleasure of smelling.  t-chocolate bourbon oaky goodness raisins coffee. can’t believe this is 14.5 percent abv.  m- rich and oily  o- it’s incredible. it lives up to the hype.
692,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.91,pours a deep brown nearly black.  the smell is very reminiscent of whiskey due to the barrel aging. slight alcohol tinge but very fruity and sweet smelling. the smell is like raisins or figs. there is a slight fermentation flavor that reminds me of wine likely due to the high abv.  the flavor is very sweet and low in bitterness. the flavor is extremely malty and fruity. the taste seems like a cross between a high malt beer a wine and a bourbon. notes of figs raisins trailed by syruppy molasses and fermentation flavors.  the mouthfeel is thick and syrupy.  a very excellent beer
693,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.75,this is my favorite stout beer. since i live in the chicago area its easily accessible. i see some reviews that state kbs is as good or better. im writing this review to say that is false.
694,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.75,pours very dark. dark tan foam. heavy bourbon aroma. big flavors. chocolate caramel and oak. very complex but well balanced. strong alcohol finish. beyond excellent. best imperial stout ive ever had.
695,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.83,look: pours obsidian black with a very light copper-colored head.  smell: strong whiskey and vanilla aromas along with fudge and coffee.  taste: silky smooth bourbon and vanilla taste i’m also getting the hints of chocolate and coffee and there is also some caramel going on as well. the oak is present as it goes down and just finished the taste perfectly.  feel: man this is too smooth for how heavy it is. the feel is heavy but this is easily drinkable and just paints the palette with a velvety finish.  overall: absolute dynamite for the style this is one of the best out there and lives up to the hype.
696,All Hallows Treat,4.61,l- pours jet black with light quickly dissipating head out of a 16 oz can. little to no lacing s- unmistakable peanut butter with soft chocolate and alcohol in the background. t- chololate peanut butter with some light banana ester flavors are present here. similar to a really good trappist ale but with some extra fun... f- medium light carbonation. my only complaint is that this beer could use a bit more carb to retain some head. o- maybe my favorite beer ive had in the flavored stout realm. this beer really delivers on what was advertised.
697,All Hallows Treat,3.84,for those who think that you have to give up the childhood treats for craft beer brewery ommegang has some news for you! applying a light coat of chocolate and peanut butter onto a belgian-styled stout gives us a little more treat and a much less trick.  dark and rusty garnet all hallows treat comes with a yeasty fogginess and a heady tarnish froth. as the scent of fruit and chocolate come first the undercurrents of peanut vinous spice and deep caramelization provides a complex and balanced aroma. sweet with brown sugar hard candy and chocolate the early palate shares a malty balance with a sugary coat of spice cake.  as the ale rolls along the middle palate the fruit flavors of cherry date fig and raisin links up with a near pie-spice medley of cinnamon allspice clove and ginger for that quintessential beglain balance. but then the chocolate and peanut come together in a buttercup way especially with the lingering candied sweetness that leads to a vinous peppery and woodsy taste late on the palate.  full bodied and malty-dry overall the beer carries a drying and relaxed sense of maltiness with hints of cola and coffee into a long aftertaste redolent with red wine and spiced rum.
698,All Hallows Treat,3.89,purchased as part of a “build your own “ 4 pack from wegmans in collegeville pa. purchased on 8/28/23. two dates on the bottom of the can: 7/17/23 which is the canned date and 2/12/24.  l- pitch black.  s- robust peanut butter and subtle dark chocolate aroma.  t- bitter dark chocolate faint peanut butter flavor.  f- quite thin mouthfeel. moderate carbonation.  o- a good imperial stout. the aroma is better than the flavor but still enjoyable!
699,All Hallows Treat,3.94,aroma is peanut butter chocolate and slightly earthy dark malts. the flavor is fruit/mild raspberries/cherries dark malts and a mildly sweet chocolate/peanut butter finish.
700,All Hallows Treat,4.15,not much to look at…black with a little short-lived head. no lacing. chocolate and vanilla on nose with a hint of peanut butter. the flavor is where this shines… same as nose but really amped up without tasting like fake chemical additions. moderate to heavy-ish body but leaving a clean mouth feel.
701,All Hallows Treat,3.84,ommegang all hallows treat imperial stout 7.6% abv. pours black with a slight head that dissipated quickly. nose is slight peanut butter and chocolate. taste follows slightly sweet moderately bitter. decent mouthfeel overall very good.
702,All Hallows Treat,3.96,black in color with a fingernail of beige around nearly all of the rim. there’s also just a trace of it elsewhere on top. the aroma is of a lot of peanut butter and some milk chocolate. i’m tasting peanut butter and milk chocolate. the mouth is dry and viscous.
703,All Hallows Treat,3.91,pours dark. thin foam. heavy pb aroma. tasty pb and chocolate body. not too sweet. good flavor. could be smoother. i wouldnt call this imperial at 7.6 but its worth a try.
704,All Hallows Treat,4.43,love this one sweet balanced cocoa chocolate sweet peanut butter very balanced hops not dry in the slightest. dark sweet easy drinking hope to find it again.
705,Foggy Window,4.34,from a 16oz can dated 08/29/23. served in a spiegelau ipa glass. cap-tip to @franktank18 for his resourcefulness incidental generosity and just how murderous he looks in a tie.  pours an opaque milky orange with two fingers of airy whipped egg white-like foam. retention is fairly decent leaving a fizzy cap and sudsy slippery lacing.  nose is pretty faint but what there is of it seems to me sugary candy-like. aroma of lemon drops and orange lifesavers.  taste is less sweet than expected drier and more tart. tasting lemon rind tangerine and gooseberries. some astringency standing in for actual legitimate bitterness - but not such that i’d care to complain about it.  feel is dry and drying clean and maybe feeling a bit lighter bodied than it really is due to fairly aggressive bright and fizzy carbonation. there’s a mildly acidic and boozy smoulder in the gullet not unexpected given the abv.  overall tasty and gone all too soon. in accordance with can instructions i shall now refrain from operating machinery for some appropriate period of time.
706,Foggy Window,4.48,appearance - the beer was the expected hazy orange color with a fluffy white head topping in the glass.  smell - the moment i open the can  it radiated oranges. the sweetness was penetrating.  taste - from the moment of the first sip the profile was very orange forward. however it was not all candy fruit as there was a nice level of bitterness. there were notes of fluffy dreamsicle orange throughout the taste.  mouthfeel - this was a thick one with the haze clogging the spaces in between teeth.  overall - this was a benchmark new england ipa.
707,Foggy Window,4.28,16oz. can into a founders snifter.  nice pale orange color creamy white head. nose is citrus fruit overripe white peach and clementine juice. very aromatic. beer opens peach gummy clementine and cantaloupe. cane sugar sweetness and more citrus fruit in the middle. some resin and grapefruit dryness in the end. body is light with moderate carbonation. soft and velvety on the palate and goes down dry with a long lingering finish. super drinkable.  great balance with an incredible mouthfeel.
708,Oerbier,4.21,330ml bottle into a tulip. bottled february 2019 so over 4 years old.  looks splendid dark reddish brown body with a persistent off white head leaving gobs of lacing. musty fruit aroma. taste is sweet and a little tart with tons of dark fruit and a winey note. aged beautifully. abv well hidden.
709,Oerbier,4.29,foggy amber color minimal head. smell is sweet with figs honey cranberry oak and orange peel. taste is sweet and tart. upfront caramel and toasted malt quickly becomes tart cranberry apple and grape with hoppy notes and oak. there’s a bit of lingering bread on the finish as well. feel is a bit chalky with a nice alcohol presence. wonderful complexity and balance.
710,Oerbier,4.24,11.6 ounce bottled april 2021 (13 months ago) poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 9% abv. the beer pours opaque medium brown with light brown head. the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves no lacing. the aroma is moderate in strength featuring raspberry cherry clove and brown sugar. the taste is semisweet burnt sugar caramel with additional notes of raspberry and cherry before a mildly earthy mildly bitter finish. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with just above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. no trace of the abv in the aroma or taste. overall very good.
711,Oerbier,4.08,12oz can. no dating information found. murky amber brown colored body. light tan head. leaves layered rings of lacing. aroma fills the immediate area of the glass. roasted malts but the wafting smells are an array of dark fruits and yeast esters. spicy as in esters. taste expresses dark fruits sweet green apple a bit of sour wine and a hint of chocolate. roasted malts make a base. goes tart then sweet. aftertaste is a mix of fruit spice and caramel. medium mouth feel. alcohol is quite well hidden but comes through a bit in the nose. good carbonation. not what i expected even the nose is considerably different from the flavors. there is complexity here.
712,Oerbier,4.34,bbe 7/22. 33cl bottle to wine glass.  look: pours a lightly reddish opaque brown with a beige fluffy head that dissipates after a while without leaving any lacing. no floaters.  smell: dark red fruits especially sour cherry. also red apple and plum. rather acidic than sweet.  taste: notes of sour cherry plum raisins ripe red apples caramel and brown sugar. fruity and malty. first tart then sweet and somehow bitter. a bit alcoholic.  feel: not as full as other belgian dark ales. rather juicy and quite fresh. medium carbonation.  overall: not the best but easily one of the most interesting and unique belgian beers ive had. very complex and nicely balanced with taste notes you wouldnt expect in one and the same beer. it feels a bit like a melange of the most famous belgian beer styles. very good beer with an even better bottle label.
713,Oerbier,3.67,l: dark red brown. more brown than red wine similar to a light dr.pepper. minimal head tan in color.  s: dark fruit notes. tartness.  t: dark fruit notes again prune raisins and stone fruit. a little saltiness to it like a nut brittle. tart sour fruit.  f: medium-full bodied. creamy and full mouthfeel that sour tartness around the mouth.  o: very dark fruit forward. decent for the category.
714,Oerbier,4.2,bottle to tulip zeno’s pub state college penna.  l: reddish-to-brown with a finger of tan head that fades quickly but leaves a layer behind. not much lacing. s: i get bready maybe some barrel and a little fruit (plums?) t: plums other stone fruits some barrel heat with a spicy finish. as it warms up i get more sweetness. f: medium-bodied dry finish. o: outstanding belgian dark. everything de dolle does is great
715,Jai Alai IPA,3.99,95?  ipa my ass.  tastes like a mass produced burnt ale. quite malty.  not bad for the style. but pretty terrible as an ipa.
716,Jai Alai IPA,3.85,really good easy to sink ipa. pours opaque lemon gold good head medium lacing. notes of lemon and grapefruit. taste follows with minimal dankness.really enjoyable.
717,Jai Alai IPA,3.76,would love to try this super fresh but a solid legend nontheless.
718,Jai Alai IPA,3.32,smells nice nothing that blows me away but i know that i am cracking into a good ipa. has a very citrus taste with a decent bitter and rosin flavor. nothing that bites me away or particularly wows me but enjoyable on a nice hot day.
719,Jai Alai IPA,4.46,so i was an “early adopter” of ipas and have tasted tons of greats tons of meh but mostly a lot of unbalanced stuff…  juicy ne west coast east coast missoula citrus guava pale over oak dry-hopped let’s just shove chia hops in a bottle and call it done:  this is just nice. very balanced. not overly sugary. alcohol is well-hidden and i don’t feel like i’m drinking repurposed bong-water.  this is a lovely well-balanced experience.  p.s. i have lived in fl for three years and avoided it like the plague mainly because i just want a decent refreshing lager.
720,Jai Alai IPA,4.24,this beer is super popular in florida and kind of put this brewery on the map. it’s smooth and easy to drink. good beer to snag at any local store in florida or out of state if you like ipas.
721,Jai Alai IPA,4.39,great beer especially if you can find it fresh outside of florida. just picked up a 6 canned 15 days ago. my second favorite ipa next to two hearted.
722,Jai Alai IPA,4.25,from a 12oz can:  appearance: clear yellow-gold big head.  smell: citrusy pine citrus rind.  taste: on the sweet side to start grapefruit sweetened with a few spoonfuls of table sugar. citrusy sweetness continues through the body the finish dries up a little with some orange and a little bitterness.  overall: finally got a 6 pack that wasnt old so i can do a review. on the sweet side for a traditional ipa but less sweet than most of the new hazy/cloudy ipas. i kind of like my old-school ipas with a little sweetness so no problems here. a good drinker but falls off when it is old.
723,Faro,4.37,pours a clear golden yellow 1 eggshell head that fades out to a coaster of head moderate lacing. nose is malic green apple good funk and rounder barrel notes far back; complex belgian candi sugar notes come through as it warms. but fairly mild. taste follows - nicely tart but not bracing; very little residual sugar. just a touch of dark fruit on the palate. finish is dry and mouthfeel is moderate with good weight lightly carbonated. a very enjoyable and well executed beer.
724,Faro,3.95,think this was a sept 2018 release. apple and lemon tart definitely fruity. mild funk. very easy drinking. @d half of the bottle 24 hrs later showed even more funk on nthe nose less apple more lemon. for only $8 on closeout this was a qpr darling.
725,Faro,4.25,rare stateside example no added sweetener or unfermented sugar in the process bottled conditioned with belgian candi sugar that ferments out.  moderately tart and juicy with citrusy grapefruit and lemon dry oak in the aftertaste. hazy amber with mild wet hay funk in the aroma. medium bodied well attenuated. very tasty and reminiscent of 3f faro i had earlier this year before toer de geuze.
726,Faro,4.18,had on tap. find many faros to be very sweet cumulatively but this was not the case here. the barrel presence really helped balance plus the lemon brett grass hay cracker malt and orange zest add in enough crisp flavor by themselves. smell is more brett and citrus forward than taste. feel is incredibly airy and bright wonderful for a faro. really one of the best faros i have had
727,Faro,4.25,on draft. stemmed glass. slightly cloudy straw yellow body one finger white head good retention bit of lacing here and there. smell is funk-forward; oak dry lemon a bit of bright citrus zest mild acetic acidity leather white grape zest a touch of grain. flavour is incredibly refreshing; it has some complexity to it from the method traditionelle component- bright citrusy lemon bit of leathery brett damp oak but tempered by the light acetic acidity and grainy lemon-forward presence of meerts. the sugar doesnt really play a big role here; it seems to perhaps add a bit of dryness. mouthfeel is medium bodied good carbonation incredibly refreshing and re-energizes my palate with every sip i take after drinking the stout i had next to it. a really tasty brew from ffg it combines the best of the two things they do quite well.
728,Ichnusa,1.91,best before: 02/2024. classic smell of industrial beer on the nose: only malts and cereals. (especially corn). very clear straw very clean... very filtered. nice foam hat. in the mouth effervescent liquid without soul. classic industrial product based on maize and with a contribution of hops reduced to a minimum both in terms of taste and above all in terms of bitterness. just enough body not to be called watery and always active carbonation. malted part that prevails but does not give a real defined taste. slight hint of corn in the aftertaste and nothing else. beer for mass consumption. soulless.
729,Ichnusa,2.45,nice light taste but there are other beers i would buy again
730,Ichnusa,3.53,i tried this beer a few days ago when i arrived in rome. poured from a brown 22.3 oz. bottle. has a straw color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of malts a touch skunky. taste is strong of malts and grains refreshing. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer.
731,Ichnusa,3.23,330ml bottle poured into la chouffe tulip.  a: golden clear medium sized head which hung around for a bit and left some lacing.  s: other than a small hint of malt there wasnt much to report.  t: malty slight notes of corn and grain.  m: crisp texture moderate carbonation.  o: typical southern european pale lager not bad for what it was but not exciting or memorable.
732,Ichnusa,1.83,cerveza ligera de carbonatación media con una cabeza espumosa de poca retención. aromas débiles a malta y maíz. en boca es plana sin llegar a destacar ningún ingrediente.
733,Ichnusa,2.68,from a large bottle obtained in cagliari sardinia. clear golden color with white head. smells of grain. light feel and moderate carbonation. light grain and straw flavors with some grassy hops. had this on a hot day accompanied by pizza and it was pretty enjoyable. but on its own its a pretty generic euro lager.
734,Ichnusa,3.15,looks thin smells bready tastes relatively okay but with slightly sharp almost annoying carbonation and a bit strange sticky bitter aftertaste. anima sarda - sardinian soul stands on the label i hope there was one originally before heineken...
735,Susan,4.02,draught. bitter and black pepper. meh.
736,Susan,4.9,#159 yummy!
737,Susan,4.87,golden amber with a modest and enduring off-white head a full clear pint glass full just spilled out of a tap head. as with many hazies this doesnt punch the nose but it is pleasant. theres a pleasant starchy backing for resinous hops which arent at all that bitter to smell. theres a near perfect softness to the mouthfeel just like a hazy styled aipa should provide. unlike too many others its neither too thin nor too sticky. the same goes for the hopping. it too is close to perfect for the style. its vaguely resinous with a hint of a spice like lemongrass coriander or pepper. with some nice glass lacing this also looks close to perfect. overall this is one incredibly good beer. outside of new england this is a rare find. when it shows beer geeks are on their phones to their buddies and it doesnt last long.
738,Susan,4.82,one month old. can to wine glass.  l: pours an opaque golden brownish orange with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. no floaters.  s: hoppy and slightly malty with notes of ripe orange honey pines and stone fruits. herbal and grassy.  t: malty with caramelly and bready notes on the one side hoppy with a fruity sweetness on the other side. honey peach and a bit of pineapple.  f: crisp and crushable with a medium carbonation. soft and smooth.  o: i think ive never had a beer with less than 8% abv that was as complex and flavorful as this one. even though it drinks almost as crisp as a lager all kinds of malty and hoppy notes keep popping up. absolutely outstanding.
739,Susan,4.34,canned 12/13/22  alright it’s time. the highest rated american ipa on ba!! i’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time and i’m thrilled to finally get the opportunity to. i’ve been seeing more hill farmstead beers near me as time goes on and i’m excited by all of it. let’s see if it can truly live up to the hype  pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing  the nose is somewhat delicate for lack of a better word but still shows an excellent balance of all of its elements that ends up turning out really nice. im picking up on aromas of orange zest pine sap bready malt grassy hops honey pineapple juice white pepper grapefruit zest and light orange marmalade  in taste it falls a little bit flat of the complexity on display in the aroma not exactly one-dimensional but more focused on bitterness. on the front end of the sip im tasting grapefruit zest piney hops bready malt weed white pepper honey light passionfruit and pineapple. the swallow brings notes of crackery malt white pepper piney hops fresh cut grass honey grapefruit zest passionfruit and light orange  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick and sharp beer. finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness  while i think this is quite good its nothing mind blowing. theres better examples of the style out there but id also like to try this fresher one day as ive heard hf can be really particular about the best by dates on their ipas
740,Susan,4,poured from tap into a 12 oz tulip glass at positive pies in plainfield. hazy-ish golden yellow with one fingers worth of head. light citrus taste coupled with biscuit/bread tones. good hop presence but not overpowering. good.
741,Bir Bintang Pilsner,2.92,bintang “pilsner” 330ml green glass bottle “best before bb190122”  notes: labeled “for export only”. clear deep gold/brass in color beneath a short head of bright white. surprisingly good head retention and lacing! aroma of basic dull grainy malt and generic hops. fyi this is an adjunct beer with “sucrose” added. flavor follows with no exception. short and dry finish. medium-light in body and crisp. overall quite dull and boring.
742,Bir Bintang Pilsner,3.36,that bitterness make me sick. but at least this beer is still drinkable
743,Bir Bintang Pilsner,1.51,330ml bottle in a hotel in surabaya at inr65000 the cheapest on the menu. i had to check the label as i initially thought the waiter had brought me a non-alcoholic version. very little to recommend here other than the fact it can be gulped down like water taste not dissimilar to water in fact. boasting the colour of weak tea and a rapidly diminishing foamy head this drink entices the nose with very little at all. the tasting doesn’t disappoint as the hope of any flavour is dashed by its soapy blandness. if you’ve been surfing all day this stuff is probably great but i hadn’t and it wasn’t.
744,Bir Bintang Pilsner,1.28,looks and feels like most standard malty american lagers. bland malt smell head thins into a broken lace. looks like apple juice or urine tastes malty with a metallic-tinge and a slightly chemical soapy aftertaste. in the part of indonesia where i stayed it was the most abundant and affordable alcoholic beverage and was a decent thirst quencher. avoid otherwise.
745,Bir Bintang Pilsner,1.64,decanted from a 11.2 oz (330 ml) can into a custom taster pint; best by 30 july 2019. a: pours a nearly clear dark golden color with a less than one finger briefly foamy white head no serious retention and little or no lacing. s: picked up a butyric acid aroma throughout. hard to smell anything other than that. t: dry. almost an apple flavor very light malty and grainy with low bitterness. m: light bodied with very low carbonation. drinks smoothly but slightly astringent. o: off aroma of butyric acid is pretty much a deal breaker. this was also not an old can based on the best by dating so no excuse. basically a very low end pilsener. might be my lowest rating ever.
746,First Call,4.08,clear yellow pour with a full eggshell head. medium roast coffee with slight cocoa with pale hops for the nose. taste adds a buttery malt base to the sharp coffee and hops to play off of. feel is light crisp rises sharply to a pale finish. a fun use of coffee in an unorthodox style selection well balanced makes this work
747,First Call,4.14,a: pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a decent head. s: pale malt coffee t: coffee biscuit hops on the finish. taste is mostly coffee though not overly strong but over shadows everything else. m: medium bodied and smooth o: easy drinking would make a nice after dinner beer (for those that like coffee with dessert).
748,First Call,4.09,from brewvana 12 days of christmas. theres dating on the bottom of the can but it is unreadable.  it pours a not quite clear orange gold with a small but persistent head of foam with excellent lacing.  the smell has strong notes of coffee pretty much overwhelms everything else. i do get a light hop kick.  the taste is a wee bit more complex. big coffee some hops detecting some lactose like flavour. hops seem to be noticeable mostly in the finish.  great mouthfeel.  very interesting and very enjoyable.
749,First Call,3.11,caffe latte almost on nitro. fresh! appears... common. nose is all coffee. body is nice and smooth almost its redemptive quality. taste is all coffee. gets a bit bitter as it warms and the “coffee” aspects fade there are no indications of turtles cheesecake pecans or cocoa. i give it a wobbly ‘ok’..  part of the awesome extreme beer box 2022!
750,First Call,4.25,can from the extreme beer box. pours a clear light amber gold with a finger bubbly white head that sticks around nice lacing smell is straight ground coffee beans chocolate covered espresso beans cocoa powder maybe hints of graham cracker crust sourish grain twang but mostly beautiful fruit roast coffee taste is roasted espresso coffee beans sweet espresso foam coffee ice cream cocoa powder caramel hints of nutty pecan graham cracker and sour grains feel is medium bodied creamy and smooth sweet. the coffee is complimented by the cocoa nibs and the pecans don’t get the cheesecake but it adds a nice sweetness to the the overall coffee/roast chocolate character an excellent coffee forward lager.
751,First Call,3.94,creamy coffee flavored lager with caramel cocoa after taste great beer to enjoy
752,First Call,4.45,i never had a coffee lager before so this sounded interesting. from a 16 oz. can it poured a great caramel color with a one inch head. there was no mistaking the coffee aroma. the coffee flavor was nice and smooth but it might be a little sweet for some. the head dissipated quickly and the carbonation wasnt overpowering...maybe a little thin.
753,First Call,4.09,very interesting beer. billed as a lager but had some nice coffee notes. 4/21/20 date printed on can. pours a deceptively clear golden color with a little fluffy white head and some scant lingering lacing. smells of crisp bready malt medium roast coffee caramel vanilla corn and some faint milk chocolate and perhaps some nuttiness. taste follows the nose good balance surprisingly clean crisp coffee punch throughout. nicely done. smooth mild mouthfeel quite round in the mouth for a lager. good carbonation retention. quite an interesting refreshing easy to drink beer.
754,Labatt Blue Light,2.38,tastes like beer watered down. still it is refreshing when youre thirsty. if you have a touchy stomach like i do its a good choice. that is  if price is an issue.
755,Labatt Blue Light,2.51,12oz can  on a hard pour 2 fingers of head that dissipates as son as it goes above the rim of my glass. the head itself dissipates to a surprisingly clingy ring around the glass that actually leaves some lacing although over a couple minutes it dissapears.. body is a clear light golden yellow.  aroma is basically just cheap beer theres that industrial lager funk going on that implies dryness but not much else.  flavor is similar to the aroma but i actually get some malt. again not a lot going on but i guess there is some citrus from the hops like regular blue.  for a light beer the feel is fine but not great. the finish is verging on long with a mouth coating seemingly dry maltiness.  overall not a bad cheaper light beer certainly better than coors light but not all that amazing.
756,Labatt Blue Light,4.36,the lightest crispest and most inoffensive cheap beer option.
757,Labatt Blue Light,5,blue light is easily one of the most prestigious beverages around. have you ever just wanted to slam 24pack. well this is the beer to do it with. after drinking 10-12 of these only thing you can think is dang that went down to easy. if you luck the magical labatt will bless you with out a hangover. best beert
758,Labatt Blue Light,3.39,a notch above southern mainstream corn style lights in taste imo. def go to when in the north!
759,Labatt Blue Light,2.63,12oz can into a tall lager glass. l: pours pale light caramel w a thin eggshell white head decent large carbo bubbles light random splotchy lacing. s: grains lightly sweet malts corn lightly metallic a light trace of pastry dough. t: sweet grains corn a hint of malting a suggestion of grassy hops lightly pale no aftertaste. f: gently fizzy lighter bodied feel w a very fast finish that is rather drying. o: fast dry easy drinking and rather light on taste and thats good as its quite dry on the tongue which aids in faster drinking. i enjoy the dryness of it and think its good in its style.
760,Labatt Blue Light,2.23,this was another one bottle purchase. good thing that i didnt get more. terrible beer. i really had a hard time drinking this one as the taste reminded me of diluted beer at least what i thought.
761,Keene Idea,4.37,old school piney crisp westie. just a style that isnt brewed enough these days and its a real shame. kick you in the teeth bitter - pours a delicious golden amber and perfectly carbed. very sippable. not sure it lives up to the god-like status some hold it in but its a very solid west coast ipa.
762,Keene Idea,4.44,not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of it\s an old style not fit for today\s trends.......it was brewed to be a piney bitter and malty beer and it\s damn well crafted. if you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of louis xiii cognac would you poo-poo it for being different? old school west coast ipa\s exist for a reason and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style. this beer is a fantastic brew with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just don\t find with most beers made elsewhere. when you take a sip you just know it is a well crafted and balanced brew.
763,Keene Idea,3.75,no. no no no. i cant understand how everyone takes this well-balanced yet boring double ipa and elevates it to a godly status. its fine but the flavors scent and mouthfeel stop there. as a california born dude i above all want to champion our beers. this is fine but its just not the champ.
764,Keene Idea,4.28,many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. theyre not wrong. this beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s juiciness for a safety net.  make no mistake this is a bitter beer. it demands an experienced drinkers palate but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy piney resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double ipa genes.  in reality this is an anachronism in 2022. it recalls the ibu wars of 15 years ago but remains relevant because at the end of the day its a damn good beer  cheers!
765,Keene Idea,4.78,pours golden in color with a nice head that leaves a beautiful lacing. the nose is slightly sweet almost honey like hint but a bitterness added. taste is bitter that quickly goes away with a dry finish. superb beer.
766,Keene Idea,4.02,nearly clear amber brew with plenty of foam in the fat wheat beer glass. lush with creamy carbonation. malty and medium sweet. aromatic with citrus and papaya. taste is candied bitter orange or marmalade. very sippable and well made.  hops are listed at citra southern cross nelson and pacific jade. this dipa bears the extra alcohol and malt well. a little of a hop overdose as you might expect. i have not had an alpine beer in years so was happy to try one i had not seen. brewed in san diego. from the 16 oz can dated 10/25/21.
767,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.5,it tastes like a tomato flavored sprite a bit too rich for me. i’d be curious to try it with a freshly cracked open modelo especial and the fixings added afterwards that would also bump the alc/vol up from 3.5% to 4.4%. the canned version will not be a repurchase for me.  style: fruit beer | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 3.5% | rating: 2.5
768,Modelo Especial Chelada,4.64,this is a great summer beer to drink in the pool or river on a hot summer day. especially between meals if you want to fancy line a pint glass with salt and lime slice. perfect beer!
769,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.82,24 ounce can best by date of jul 2022 stamped on the bottom of the can. served in a pint glass the beer pours a slightly hazy reddish/amber color with about a half inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly. pretty much no lacing at all. the brew smells like tomato juice and salt and thats about it. taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of some lime grainy malt and a slight weird bitter flavor. i didnt care for it much at first but did get a little better as it warmed. mouthfeel/body is light its easy enough to drink with a good amount of carbonation. this is ok i guess but theres other chelada style beers id rather have. but with that being said id drink this one again if someone gave me one.
770,Modelo Especial Chelada,1.47,24oz can served to me by so-called friends  this is an abomination no matter how you slice it... but people seem to love it... im not sure how to rate this because i truly hate it but it obviously has its place: ive seen these chelada beers all over. gives me gut rot heartburn and tastes like musty cheap beer and spoiled tomato juice  ugh
771,Modelo Especial Chelada,4.06,it was very tasty.
772,Modelo Especial Chelada,3.02,tried this on a whim as i dont think i have ever had a chelada style beer. drank from the 24oz can. the beer smells and tastes like v8 which is to be expected with a slightly salty finish. nothing much more to say. i tried to find other notes but it was tomato all the way. altogether not terrible but id rather have a bloody mary.
773,Modelo Especial Chelada,3,bought a 24oz can $3.25 foodland 122 days old or 4 months before best by month date stamp smell of lime and tomatoes reddish brown color high carbonation medium-heavy mouthfeel taste of tomato salt lime. reminds me of a chilled tomato soup appetizer. overall not bad. first time drinking a chelada and it is better than i expected. refreshing on a hot day. good as a pre-meal drink.
774,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.71,my wife loves these things im still trying to learn her ways but this is marginally better than some of its peers i suppose. brewed with natural and artificial flavors and sweeteners and whatever the hell certified color is sounds pretty fake to me and that kind of thing turns me off in beer shouldnt it just be tomato juice and some salt and lime? i dont know but it doesnt taste bad. murky reddish brown color to this no head at all but a lot of fizz and just a little sediment in the big can which was somewhat more expensive than anticipated not quite a budget beer. it smells salty and citrus forward some acidity evident from the tomato and a natural enough lime essence maybe a hint of black pepper too but i dont get any real beer character in the aroma at all more like a bloody mary without the booze this is very low alcohol. the flavor is okay salty and kind of cheap tasting at first but the tomato comes in nicely and there is a v8 juicy vibe to it. it is a touch sweet and i wish that would go away but also i think the proportion of beer is a little light in here like i want more lager crispness coming through and i think this loses some refreshment capacity because its more the tomato juice than the beer. that said ive had worse and even though this gets a little yucky as it warms its one of the lesser of the evils i reckon in this style. nothing is ever going to beat making and blending your own but you can do a lot worse than this one. ive heard from a trusted source that the limon is dynamite i need to track that one down...
775,Smooth,4.3,yellow gold in color with a murky complexion. the aroma is of fresh nectarines and lactobacillius. im tasting fresh nectarine juice and lactobacillius which on a day with a 100+ heat index is very refreshing. the mouth is crisp and moderately carbonated.
776,Smooth,4.5,finally got to visit side project and this bad boy happened to be on and did not disappoint. great acid level that was not overpowering and was just dripping with ripe nectarine flavour; phenomonal beer!
777,Smooth,4.24,burnt orange with white head that quickly disappears. tart nectarine and barnyard funk. crisp and dry. overall quite nice.
778,Smooth,4.42,pours an amber orange with white head. aroma of oranges and grapes. hits you with a sour pucker that fades. lots of orange nectarine with vinous notes. very well done.
779,Smooth,4.19,look - clear golden with great rimming smell - tart yeasty grain taste - fantastic nectarine tartness feel - light and crisp slight syrup overall - really nice beer
780,Traquair Jacobite,3.78,l: solid almost black brown with a khaki head. appears red when viewed from above s: coffee banana molasses worcestershire or soy sauce t: coca-cola cream coffee molasses. coriander similar to gin f: touch watery  a very mild pleasant scotch ale. no alcohol bite. probably would work well in cooking where a darker beer is desired.
781,Traquair Jacobite,4.16,bought in 2017 with expiration date 2025. dark brown color with no head. rich malty aroma with notes of cocoa dark fruits vanilla and dates. flavor with notes of dark fruits cocoa lots of plums nuts licorice cola maillard and mild coriander. if i want i can keep harvesting other alike flavors. dry aftertaste with a medium bitterness. light to medium body with mild carbonation. alcohol of 8% is absent. complex scotch ale with lots of different nuances raging from dark fruits to nutty flavors to malt diversity. this aged incredibly well.
782,Traquair Jacobite,4.31,look- very dark with a thin rapidly dissipating head. 4.25  smell- sweet candied fruit 4.50  taste - fruity esters that finishes dry 4.25  feel- slight tingle on the tongue and finishes clean 4.25  overall - very enjoyable scotch ale. one of the best ive had and certainly the best non ba one. 4.25 #98a moment ago
783,Traquair Jacobite,3.92,bottle from altopalato served at home in a dimpled mug. brown rddisih colur small head with no retention and no lacing. aroma of dried fruits dates raisins toffee roasted malts vanilla. medium to full body creamy texture flat carbonation sweet finish. taste follows the aroma. very good.
784,Traquair Jacobite,4.25,best before january 31...not sure if this mean january 2031? or january 31st on an unnamed year; drank 2/23/22 @ the yarchives.  semi-opaque brown orange appearance.  an even pour yielded a small noisy khaki head; decent lace.  sarsaparilla black licorice & mild coriander notes in the nose.  creamy medium mouthfeel.  coriander blackberry & cream flavors.  interesting tasty but pretty challenging overall. definitely worth trying!
785,Traquair Jacobite,4.4,been a damn minute since i have had this beer maybe a decade to be honest. one of those beers i tried in the very beginning of getting into craft beer. excited to see what i think with some experience now.  a- very dark brown cola body when poured from the stubby 500ml bottle into a becher glass. a nice foamy cap up to a finger with a very light tan off white hue. small sheets of thin lacing.  s- rich and sweet dark dried fruits are bright and intense with raisin prune and especially plum coming to mind. definitely picking up a touch of herbal coriander as well as a hint of orange peel. molasses brown sugar toffee nuttiness pear caramel berry jam and a hint of smoke.  t- just ground up some coriander the other day and it is not exactly strong but certainly a featured prominent flavor atop the rich dark grains and the dried dark fruits from the ferment. the malt profile is diverse with toasty nutty bready grainy slight cocoa light roast caramel molasses and a touch of smoky notes. plums are bright and are joined by notes of raisin and prune. pear comes to mind again.  mf- medium bodied overall with a foamy and slightly creamy texture. the carbonation is at a moderate level and it has a smooth soft feel to it. ends with a spice bitterness lingering.  coriander a ton of dark bright fruits and a great malt profile. brings me back a long ways and still a classic that really is quite unique.
786,Traquair Jacobite,4.1,poured this beer from a bottle purchased at a dallas bottle shop into a tulip glass. dark brown color with a reddish hue. initially a beige head and some lacing. caramel and oak smell and taste. pleasant warming beer but expected it to be a bit meatier. a nice beer and i bet it is better fresh on tap.
787,Traquair Jacobite,4.12,review 1514  i had no idea that i did not review this beer. i have drunk this beer several years ago do not remember much about it. the beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. the pour of the beer created a light tan one-finger head. the head is creamy and foamy with excellent retention. the slow dissipation on the glass left a lot of lacing on the glass. the color of the beer is srm 24 dark brown with ruby red hues. this beer is opaque. overall this beer is above average for this style.  the aromas in the beer are caramel roasted malts toffee malty sweetness subtle peat a touch of smoke a smidge of maillard floral oranges and some earthiness.  the flavors in the beer start with a light caramel then segway into peat with oranges and earthiness. next i taste some maillard floral toffee dried raisins molasses and herbal.  the mouthfeel is coating and warming.  the body of the beer is medium medium-plus carbonation and a medium-plus finish.  at times i felt the malts thin out. it is a malty beer with expressive flavors. it is a solid scotch ale. i wanted a beefier malt profile to make it heavier.
788,Oktoberfest,3.54,this one was a bit disappointing to me. this brewery is world class and maybe my expectations were high b/c of that but honestly i prefer the sam adams oktoberfest to this one. it seemed to be missing some of the toasted malty goodness that i notice in other fest beers but maybe my palate was off that day. ill give it another shot sometime but it underwhelmed me. a tad too light with the malt and lacking in depth of flavor.
789,Oktoberfest,3.64,pours a light copper color with a half finger of head. the nose has mild bready notes. the flavor is crisp and clean without the hearty maltiness that generally accompanies beers of this style. the body is light for the style as well.
790,Oktoberfest,4.09,appearance: pours a clear medium amber color. moderate white head. srm of 13. (4.25)  aroma: moderate aromas of white bread crackers yeast. some hints of honey. (4.00)  flavor: moderate flavors of pale malt crackers smooth bread. some toasted bread flower and honey. mildly sweet. dry finish. (4.00)  feel: medium-bodied excellent carbonation. smooth finish. (4.25)  compared to fair state festbier 9/2023: pours darker milder aromas. more amber notes and smooth clean mouthfeel. less rich toasted sweet.  overall: toppling goliath has a pretty good märzen. amber toasted with mild flavors. this one is subtle but excellent. rich bread lightly toasted. the aromas and flavors wont impress you initially but how they subtly linger off the smooth mouthfeel is what makes this one good. often märzens are too heavy boozy and cloyingly sweet. this is crisp dry clean and drinkable. excellent stuff. (rating: 4.09+)
791,Oktoberfest,3.95,nice marzen good caramel sweetness and breast malts lots of bitter zesty hops for the style. clear brown amber color with no head retention.
792,Oktoberfest,4.13,16oz can pkgd 7/11/23 into a dimple mug. l: pours 95% clear orange amber with a thin creamy off white head strong steady carbo bubbles good head retention very light lacing. s: caramelized malts brown bread apples a light mineral note honey. t: bright citrus a touch of honey slightly pale toasted grains orange & tangerine zest it is gently sweet plum apricot bread notes in the finish. not much aftertaste. f: brisk medium bodied with a smooth slightly creamy center then a very lightly dry finish. o: a quick-drinking lager that has a little snap to it. accents on citrus are gently sweet fruity and pleasing. it is excellent in its style.
793,Oktoberfest,3,can:  high c / average
794,Oktoberfest,3.63,i’m a huge oktoberfest fan and i really look forward to this time of year. when i was walking through the beer store today i was looking for a sam adam but it’s not out yet. so looking around they had a few and i wanted to try something new so i grab this one over bells. i liked the beer but i don’t think it’s it’s an oktoberfest its just doesn’t have that malt feel and it’s a little thin. solid lager but not what i was looking for today.
795,Oktoberfest,3.39,from a 16 oz can packed on 7/11/23 consumed on 8/12/23  clear pouring beer from the can and copper colored. when i hold it to the light i see a few carbonation bubbles rising in the glass. the head that formed was minimal less than one finger and off white. the head isnt long lasting and theres no lacing on the glass as it dissipates to a ring around the glass. the aroma is just screaming biscuit and uncooked bread to me. so malty. notes of caramel also hit my nose but faint. taste - the flavor isnt as malty as i was expecting from the aroma. it seems somewhat crisp up front with more of the malts on the back. they just dont jump out as much as i expected. theres actually more hops than i expect from this styler and they produce a bitterness on the back that just doesnt seem to work for the style. the body is decent for the style. not too sure about this one. its not bad tasting though the hop bitterness that im getting just doesnt seem right for the style.
796,Oktoberfest,3.94,pours a beautiful clear golden copper with a thick ivory head that leaves spotty lacing. aroma is caramel malt rye bread and some floral hops. flavor follows the nose sweet up front with minimal floral hops in the finish. feel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. overall another nice beer from these folks.
797,Oktoberfest,4,16oz can. date stamp on can bottom is pkg07/11/23. mostly clear deep gold colored body. two fingers of dirty white head. this transforms to a scuzzy cap and ring. leaves behind partial webs of lacing. aroma is very much of bread seems to be a mix of sourdough sweet bread and dark bread. taste is quite sweet but very malty. toasted bread sourdough home made whole grain bread and dark bread. has a touch of floral hops. all continue into the aftertaste. full mouth feel. clean and crisp finish. good carbonation. lots of bread flavors and an easy to drink feel. a meal in a can.
798,Molson XXX,2.84,kinda mid weird aftertaste not a fan of the corn flavor personally
799,Molson XXX,3.4,l: moderate yellow the head lingers and leaves some lacing but not super foamy. s: mildly sweet smell and barley malt. t: more malt than anything. sweet but not enough to offend. no harsh alcohol or medicinal flavors (impressive considering the style and abv). it definitely tastes like a malt liquor but in a good way. not noticing the corn flavor (probably still has corn syrup in there). f: medium carbonation medium body does not linger. o: considering the style price and abv its pretty good. its inching pretty close to steel reserves niche and doesnt taste gross at all. would recommend trying it for those who like the style.
800,Molson XXX,3.78,12 fl. oz. bottle served in a can glass  this beer pours a brilliant amber hue and is topped with an inch of beige head that leaves spotty lacing.  sweet malty aroma with some grain and grass scents.  sweet taste upfront. actually the sweetness carries throughout the taste. not much in the way of hops. hints of alcohol.  medium bodies with an almost syrupy mouthfeel  i am just happy to get a 12 pack of super premium beer with all these $20-25 four packs out there. fantastic value for the money. this used to be my go-to beer at my local moose lodge. it was $2 a bottle there.
801,Molson XXX,3.11,its a malt liquor from canada. its crystal clear pale yellow and has very little head. the flavor is semi- sugary sweet with an unpleasant harsh alcohol presence. there is no hop character or bitterness. its better than a malt liquor from the us. that is all. drink accordingly.
802,Molson XXX,2.43,12 ounce bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass.  l: brilliantly clear yellow one finger white head is constantly renewed by masses of rising bubbles. s: subdued quick whiff of grainy malt light aroma of clean spicy hops. t: super malty medium sweet bread grain corn a medicine taste developed about half glass sweetness builds. f: medium body crisp to open smooth finish. o: nice feel but the sweet medicinal flavor i’m getting isnt for me.
803,Molson XXX,3.52,picked up a 6 pack from the case in the cooler simply because the liquor store i live above doesnt have as many choices as the others in town. wasnt expecting much but that was the beauty of experiencing this. the other reason i decided to grab it was the fact it was brewed in golden so i was confident the water would make the beer tolerable since its so high on the abv scale. pours; and retains; a large 4 finger head staying with the beer all the way down and leaving sticky lacing on the weihenstephan glass. dry finish sweet initial taste almost a mix between a belgian golden ale and an american adjunct. great malt liquor would revisit and recommend.
804,Molson XXX,2.85,this was not awful! alcohols was well hidden despite cheap ingredients. mostly inoffensive nose of malt and corn. flavors similar with some bready notes similar to molson golden. i would have another of these for sure in a pinch.
805,Molson XXX,2.79,got a 12 oz bottle of this for free recently. poured into one of my pint glasses this pours a very clear medium golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles continuously and rapidly rising to the surface. has a nice white head thats an inch thick when first poured that settles to a very thick surface coating and a very thick ring lining the inside of the glass and decent lacing. head settles eventually to a nice film layer of surface foam and there is some pretty good lacing in the inside of the glass too after a few sips. aromas of some bready malt sweetness along w/ whats likely corn and rice and not much else. not the best aroma by any means but not unpleasant or offensive either. the taste is pretty much the same some bready malt sweetness followed by rice and corn and just a slight hint of hop bitterness. as i get a few more sips into this and as this starts to warm up a bit im starting to taste an unpleasant grassy cardboard metallic bitter like off flavor of some sort. also a touch of hops. has a crisp and also smooth medium bodied mouthfeel w/ moderate carbonation. that unpleasant grassy metallic bitterness taste lingers on my palate after each sip. im not even going to finish this one.  eric
806,Molson XXX,2.82,24 oz can pours golden with a light white head and lots of small bubbles. a light malt with ad little hops on the nose. mouthfeel is light with just a little bubble foam on the palate. the flavors are decent with a bit of malt and a generic hops. you don’t get the 7.3% bite you might expect. has a sweet rather than dry finish. a decent north american adjunct beer. try it if you like simple adjuncts.
807,Molson XXX,1.88,from a can poured into a frozen mug. some malty bread corn smell. clear gold with 3 finger head. there’s a slight sweetness to it and mostly malt. not great but not horrible. is it worth it because of the 7.3% abv? no. if that’s your destination you’re better off getting a good bottle of scotch or bourbon.
808,Molson XXX,5,i read some of the reviews which are ridiculous??? paragraphes about notes of and hints of ??? are you kidding me??? if your trying this beer and you\re a beer snob then don\t rate it! i tried this brew on my lunch hour at work with a sandwich and some veggies and it was great! better than a bud lite and satisfying for a quick lunch brew during work break. i\m not a beer snob but usually drink good beer founder\s short\s sierra nevada but for a cheap satisfying brew on launch break this beer is great! notes and hints escape me. this is why wine snobs get bilked out of millions because they think they know wine tasting. drink beer to enjoy not to examine. btw my great grandfather was a brew master from the old country who drank and made good beer and passed it down to his family. i\ve said enough enjoy this brew!!!
809,Old Milwaukee Beer,2.77,12oz can. date stamp on bottom for best by is oct0923. clear straw colored body. thin fizzy white head. small lacing spots are left behind. aroma of faint grain malts and a slight fruity hops. taste is slightly sweet from the grain malts. sulfur note later in the profile. wet cardboard malt in the aftertaste. thin mouth feel and not much else except for the fizziness. okay carbonation. americas beer or so it says on the can. this is an acceptable cheap beer and provides a buzz but not much of a reward for getting there.
810,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.63,light color like a blonde very lacy ..i poured like in that miller ad and it created a big fluffy head smells like 1970s to 1980s bar without the cigarettes  surprisingly malty leaves a feeling of both meaty heavy and refreshing light  as a side note the last time i tasted this i was a minor about 10 or 11 yrs old i have tried beer since i was a toddler only little sips and all mostly dixie and this one but after dixie closed down it was mainly this now dixie has reopened and was pressured to change it\s name to faubourg because dixie is offensive to some people... hope the bring blackened voodoo back
811,Old Milwaukee Beer,4.15,poured from a can into a pint glass. has a nice thick head that slowly fades lots of carbonation bubbles. light gold in colour. smell is wet grains taste is barley with some corn. finish is dry. good.  edit: a couple minutes later still have a thin head much like a draft beer.
812,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.61,16oz can best by 7/31/23. pours a clear golden color with a finger of foamy white head. grainy wet cardboard smell. light body with plenty of carbonation. sweet corn flavor with a strong floral hop finish. not understanding the low ratings this is pretty much a classic aal. you dont have to like the style but this is good for what it is.
813,Old Milwaukee Beer,3,poured from a 16oz can best by june 5th 2023  on the pour about a finger of head that quickly recedes to a thin cap. body is light straw yellow. high carbonation.  aroma is very dry but there is a slight skunky sulfur note that isnt very pleasant. hops are present but they add to the smell in a strange skunk boosting way. like a lower quality mexican lager. maybe some light alcohol is on the nose.  taste loses a lot of the hop character except for right up front with a slightly spicy or zezty and herbal but cheap hop note. immediately malt and corn character build in a crackery and popcorny way while maintaining a dryness.  feel is surprisingly full bodied with a slight dryness but medium long grainy moutcoating finish.  overall this is an interesting beer. the aroma made me think it was going to be worse than it was but surprisingly refreshing once on the palate. the hop notes also make this beer unique for a pabst product.
814,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.14,l- light straw color. nice white top that disappears quickly. s- corn syrup. not much else. t- i drank many of these years ago and old mil had a distinct flavor that set it apart from other aal. not anymore. f- very light smooth. nothing to report. o- sub par aal. i picked up a 30 pack and i am having trouble finishing over many weeks. i would suggest hamms or modelo especial or strohs over this beer.
815,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.53,way underrated ! especially considering the style which essentially is classic old style milwaukee adjunct lager; like what was served in midwest bars in the 70s and 80s. accept it for what it is ! extremely drinkable kind of creamy easygoing moderately light tho with acceptable taste (yes ranging from malt to hops) and reasonable body. if it was more expensive . . everyone would probably give it get a higher rating. : ) and if youre lucky . . . you get the version with the 1940s pin-up girl on the label . perfect.
816,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.6,could be worse . could be bud light miller lite or shudder to think coors light!
817,Old Milwaukee Beer,2.92,355ml can poured into kitchen glass. i dont intend to let it warm up.  might be the palest beer i ever poured. pours a pale straw yellow with one finger of sudsy white head that leaves some decent chunks of lace as it recedes.  smells of white bread crispy corn flakes faint flowers and a bit of veggie hops.  tastes of more bready malt corny adjunct and more faint veggie floral hops.  feels light and fizzy. light bodied with bubbly carbonation. finishes off-dry. its warming a bit and the taste of corn is getting more annoying.  verdict: not recommended. not very good but i cant really complain. probably good after mowing your lawn but then again so is weihenstephaner.
818,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.38,found a 12 pack of cans for under 11 bucks in a ghetto liquor store after work. its nj remember they pull your pants down check to see if your socks match and may as well stick a gun in your face for how expensive everything is in this dump state. drier than a high life possibly better than a pbr. fine lasting head great lacing dry finish. recommended. - brewed in latrobe pa
819,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.26,this beer is the epitome of an adjunct lager. if you like this style i can\t see why you would rate this beer poorly or awful as ba reviewers did. it\s crystal clear highly carbonated. color leans more yellow than gold. taste follows aroma nothing out of the ordinary. does lack depth and finish is a bit course but overall easy drinking good hot weather beer. 6 pk 16 oz was $4.99 + tax. if you like adjuncts this is a good choice.
820,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.19,doesn’t deserve the “awful” rating. a lot better then most of the mass-produced pig vomit that is out there. perfect summer fun beer.
821,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-Märzen,3.71,12oz bottle into a pint glass. best by october 2023.  reddish body head disappears quickly. sweet caramely aroma which carries over into the taste. seems a little dead not much body. no aftertaste though.
822,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-Märzen,3.75,thought this was very whatever for an oktoberfest. its not a bad beer but the hype behind it left me very disappointed. aroma is grassy/wet hay. taste is not much like aroma. its more in line with the traditional toastiness of oktoberfests but has a metallic thing going on that just hampers anything good going on here. not bad but prefer ayinger.
823,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-Märzen,3.92,was surprised to see this brew is specifically for american consumption... i wonder why? that said mine was nearing its expiration date and that may be affecting my thoughts here ... i bit flat but still good.
824,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-Märzen,3.82,very similar to heineken good beer overall.
825,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-Märzen,3.6,better than most americans märzens iv tried but 1 of my least favorite german märzens available to me.
826,Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-Märzen,4.5,a: pours a nice amber color with a white head. beer gives off that classic appearance you would expect from an oktoberfest  s: th beer as rich malty notes of toffee bread an toast. beer also has some floral scents from the hops.  t: rich malt flavor. notes of caramel and toffee. hops provide a smooth balanced finish.  mf: medium bodied.  o: excellent oktoberfest beer
827,120 Minute IPA,4.32,12 ounce bottle into a tulip snifter. bottled 3/30/17 had 5/3/22.  pours a somewhat cloudy medium amber with a quarter inch foamy head and some spotty cling. aromas of caramel malt brown sugar some pine some raisins light figs and dates. pretty similar flavors- caramel pine malt brown sugar light raisins and dates. tastes a little bit herbal with a light hop bitterness and some alcohol warming as it warms. smooth for the abv a very good medium body appropriately carbonated.  wow this really does age well. lots of caramel malt and pine. need to buy this more often. really enjoyable.
828,120 Minute IPA,4.81,this beer is so unique that it’s hard to describe. it really is nothing short of incredible and worth every penny of the price i paid for it. if you’re lucky enough to find a four pack of this in the store don’t even hesitate just buy it.
829,120 Minute IPA,4.13,5/20/23 poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at the denny house waynesburg pa....gala night for the way.  pours a strange (not bad) deep amber orange color. very little head or lacing.  hints of sweetness with the very chewy beer. pine and pineapple. smooth hoppy bite!  special beer and a fun night!
830,120 Minute IPA,4,12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2017 vintage 5 years old.  a: the most vigorous pour i could muster did not turn up any head. deep brown in color with good clarity. i half expected sediment but there really isnt any. not much in the way of lacing either. a few tiny specs.  s: a lot of raw honey apricot malty aromas of fig jam and a pop of berry. highly estery with pineapple/tropical notes. orange marmalade complete with peels. earthy and leafy notes with that aged forest floor character. treacle and a hint of toast/crust.  t: follows the nose. lots of raw honey up front figs and berries richer malty notes of molasses and toasted crust and scones. very tropical and estery- big notes of pineapple starfruit papaya. orange marmalade. hit of warming alcohol. downright spicy with herbal oiliness. earthy and leafy. dose of musty book and nutty sherry oxidation. aggressive spicy/oily hop finish with trailing alcohol heat and figgy malt.  m: very thick with a ton of coating residual sugar. it is syrupy in texture. good pressing sense of weight. carbonation is fading but theres still some fine pricking around the tip of the tongue. gritty hop astringency.  o: this beer becomes very interesting with age. it might be an acquired taste for those who prefer ipas fresh though. it becomes a three way brawl between a brawny malt character aggressively estery alcohol and a good dose of oily/spicy hops. age has deepened that malt into a lot of fruity complexity brought out more earthy forest floor hop notes and a lot of musty and sherry-like oxidation. it\s also hot and a bit much when fresh though. something like 1-3 years of age may be the sweet spot for me i think but it comes down to preferences. it certainly isn\t bad now.
831,120 Minute IPA,4.29,well well 15$ for this one. had to try it. nice experience after a hard day of work. but no sir it aint for me. tastes like a bitter honey syrup. low to no carbonation. definitely worth to try. once!!!
832,120 Minute IPA,3.99,yea this ipa is an icon. however not the most drinkable ipa for the masses. your wife nor girlfriend will like this beer! i have heard the term robitussin voiced. however you as a beer drinker must try it at least once. i’ve tried it several times.heavy and alcoholic are the first terms that come to mind. refreshing no. tasty yes. everyday no.
833,120 Minute IPA,4,pours a cloudy copper. thin foam. very chunky. cider aroma. huge malt and hop flavor simultaneously. very heavy. sweet alcohol cider finish. not really you typical ipa and not something i would drink regularly. definitely worth a try though.
834,120 Minute IPA,2.9,the 90min ipa tastes so much better than the 60min that i assumed the 120min would be amazing. perhaps i have an unrefined pallet but it tastes like a poorly made overly alcoholic mixed drink i would have made in college circa 2006. worth a try but i wont be having this ever again.
835,120 Minute IPA,4.1,got a couple of bottles of this as an x-mas gift. bottles a year or two old this is the 2021 release. poured into pint glass. pours a dark rich copper tone. the short off-white head dissipates quickly but leaves a nice ring and dense lacing. smells a little like apple cider. i take a sip. malt! malt and its punching me in the face. much maltier than it is hoppy- a logical progression from the 90 minute ipa which holds the two in balance. i wasnt sure i liked it until i kept drinking and decided i definitely do. very sweet. brings a caramel apple to mind and then you get piney notes on the back end to remind you youre drinking an ipa. a little alcoholic which works here. i wouldnt mind it being more bitter. perfectly carbonated with a full body. its a strange ipa. a prior reviewer said it reminded them of a barleywine which does track. another reviewer said its not an ipa and im not sure im equipped to argue with them. im not sure what it is though other than very good. while i do appreciate a beer that is what it says it is i can also respect a beer that dares to push limits especially when its this good.
836,120 Minute IPA,4.18,first this bottle is very old. not sure how old but could possibly be around a dozen years old. still have another bottle. so with that preface...  pours a dark copper like dark apple cider. opaque. small brown head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar.  aroma of malt dark fruit mild alcohol dark sugar spice and somewhat herbal.  taste is dark fruit alcohol [but not overpowering] apples prunes caramel bread bitter orange dates and pine.  mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing. nicely smooth in the mouth.  overall very interesting. hides the alcohol well and rather complex flavor notes.
837,120 Minute IPA,4.28,as per plan this is the xmas celebration beer the last holdout from the extreme box bottled on 9/13/19. a little over three years old it pours a deep coppery color into the tulip with lots of head that fades off rapidly into a partial top cloud and ring. it has a sweet syrupy and malty smell. it does taste sweet more sweet than bitter. the bitterness is slighty lingering around a slight alcohol taste. i think its like butterscotch and caramel up front. its a little fruity definitely along the barleywine track. fairly thick syrupy easy to drink but warming. moderately carbonated and somewhat dry. very interesting.  i would love to do a vertical taste test. the last time i had this was in... 2019! at a tasting event that also served utopias. its powerful. im really out of the race at this point.
838,120 Minute IPA,1,this is in no way an ipa. it\s false advertisement and a horrible beer product for $11-12 per bottle. it\s all hype/gimmick. it\s not satisfying at all. it\s over the top in the worst way. should be discontinued.
839,120 Minute IPA,4.73,the 2022 version is the best iteration of this beer that ive had. the hops and malt are in perfect balance for an imperial ipa.
840,120 Minute IPA,4.15,there is no rational reason to have more than one of these per occasion. so one brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. almost no head was produced and it vanished almost instantaneously. forget about the head because the brew is beautiful anyway. its bright copper-amber and its on the translucent side. malt is the predominant smell with hints of alcohol and hops. of course theres an alcoholic aspect to the taste thats too big to ignore. after all the abv here is an incredible 18 percent. considering that this tastes so much better than some that are less potent but taste like a shot of whisky was dropped into the beer. this is malty in the scottish ale way sweetly and with a kick. the hops are there for some counterbalance and they add an enjoyable extra layer of taste. but this is malt and alcohol driven. its good for what it is an attempt at making an incredibly high abv brew that tastes good. to that point this is a success for others in this range almost never taste this good. but for most beer drinkers even those that can enjoy an imperial ipa or stout in the 8-10% abv range this is a little much. there reaches a point when this much alcohol reduces the beer drinking experience and this might be it.
841,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,3.99,b11 (2020). appearance is a bright translucent yellow with plenty of persistent white head. aroma while somewhat muted is really nice up close. blind i might actually think this was a hefeweizen given the clove like esters im getting.  taste is more in line with what i was expecting with lemon & hay and some mixed fruit. very light and tasty and extraordinarily easy drinking. absolutely perfect way to end a beautiful long weekend.
842,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.3,appearance: faintly cloudy straw-yellow with a slight cap of bubbles on the top that quickly subsided.  smell: moderate barnyard funk grassy/hay notes and mild fruity notes.  taste: following the hints from the nose i pick up moderate funk notes moderate grassy/hay notes and mild citrus fruit notes. the individual flavors are very distinct from each other but at the same time form a cohesive flavor profile. the beer finishes dry with some mildly bitter grassy/hay notes.  mouth-feel: light-bodied with a modest level of carbonation.  overall: a very nice saison. tasty flavor profile with a light body and dry finish.
843,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.31,cloudy golden body with a white cap that settles into a collar. grapefruit lemon bright oak faint melon and passion fruit faint yeast nose. taste is simpler with big lemon and oak mild saison yeast faint ripe tropical fruits. feel is light and cool sour and slightly acidic dries a bit with yeast on finish
844,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.23,bottle: poured a blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. aroma of tart notes with some funky brett notes and light vinous notes. taste is a mix of tart notes with some funky brett notes and a vinous finish with light oak. body is about average for style with good carbonation and no perceptible alcohol. enjoyable saison with a nice level of complexity.
845,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.51,pours soft hazy yellow/straw with a massive head and great retention. nose is primarily brett lemon oak but smells fantastic. taste is similar to the nose a light tartness from the lemon and hay funk from the brett and balance from the oak. the flavors all blend together wonderfully to form a fantastic saison. the mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. each taste of the slight tartness invites additional sipping. just a wonderful farmhouse ale.
846,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.32,poured from a 750ml bottle into my troubadour tulip:  lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. crenelated nearly rocky lacing; superior retention.  lemon curd wildflowers hay and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well.  brett. forward on the palate tart funky and gently peppery. unripe pears meyer lemon and some minerality. low bitterness moderate sourness. more fruit than phenols. finishes fairly dry with some residual wild elements. flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.  medium bodied soft well carbonated. refreshing yet satisfying.  well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. better with food as the ales flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with.
847,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.65,on tap at windsor homebrew in anaheim ca.  tally ho! i feel like errol flynn in “the seahawk” while drinking this thing. just wow. it’s as if nothing can stop me and that i could have it all. maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty. so much so that i think that i don’t need olivia de haviland because i want them all.  i am lost. i am found. i am. i just am.
848,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.36,no bottling date (number on inside of cap indicates potential batch 10 or later released in 4/2020); consumed on 12/31/21  pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky fluffy off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap a moderate frothy collar and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.  aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.  taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish.  mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end leaving a predominantly clean activated finish.  a bright funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic.
849,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.46,appearance - the beer poured an orange-gold color with a bubbly white head.  smell - the nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent.  taste - my initial impression was the taste of green apples. the sour impression fit the green apple notes. the saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish.  mouthfeel - the carbonation gave influence to the dry finish.  overall - this is pretty much everything i want in a saison. i don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty.
850,Oktoberfest,3.34,not a fan of this one. looked great in my sam adams oktoberfest mug but went downhill from there. aroma foretold the sweetness that was to come. also some earthiness and slight alcohol comes through. flavor wise its too sweet for my liking but did have a little roasty earthiness to it and a slight bitterness on the end. not enough to save it though. alcohol poked out as it warmed. glad i only bought a single.
851,Oktoberfest,4.19,draft pour into standard shaker pint glass. light brown; nearly see-through and not much foam. malty and bread-like on the nose with a light hop presence. taste follows but i like it better than the nose. medium-full mouthfeel with a crisp finish. this is like oktoberfest lite or at least it’s very easy drinking for 6%.
852,Oktoberfest,3.79,pours a clear copper color with a nice head and lacing aroma has bready and malt hints taste has bready and malt flavors a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent marzen
853,Oktoberfest,4.24,having lived long enough in austria to be able to tell what makes a good marzen. and this one i know for sure is an excellent take on it. the good thing is that it doesn’t try to carbon copy a marzen but it takes it further instead: makes the malts more caramelized puts more hops into the aroma and brings more richness and excitement into the whole deal. sometimes marzens can get too sweet and overwhelming but this one does not. this one feels like a “craft marzen” and not just a regular one but one made in the us - which made me realize once again how great and outstanding american craft beers are. oktoberfest and a german marzen gets born again to beome a hop infused fresh and excellent craft brew with full of life. i liked it a lot never get disappointed by founders.
854,Oktoberfest,3.73,poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is copper transparent head presents 1/2 inch thick and dissipates quickly to thin top spotty lacing on the glass sides.  smell is caramel toast honey malt light earthy hops.  taste is thinner than most american oktoberfests threads the marzen/festbier styles with a grainy flavor intermixed with the caramel and german malts; limited grape nut like note with more caramel/honey flavors.  mouthfeel is lighter on the carbonation moderate sweetness crisp finish.  overall this presents as a hybrid of the fest/marzen styles - more grainy-ness less munich malt than the sweeter oktoberfest (americanized versions) and more caramel than the lighter festbier styling.
855,Oktoberfest,3.81,look: it pours amber with a white. head retention is excellent.  smell: it has bready and toasty aromas there are low spicy notes in the background.  taste: it has bready and toasty flavors with a bit of sweetness up front. there are very low herbal elements in the background.  feel: it has a smooth texture with slight alcohol warming.  overall the flavor is fairly sweet throughout the flavor tasting including the finish. it does have nice toasty bready elements.
856,Oktoberfest,3.93,canned on 07/22/22. poured a golden amber color into a standard pint glass. brite white finger high head with tons of visible fizzy carbonation and spotty lacing. aroma is mainly malty with earthy and biscuit overtones. taste of honey malts with hints of spice permeate throughout. light to medium in body is more in tune with the austrian style of märzenbier. smooth dry finish and very drinkable. one of the top american version of this type of beer.
857,Oktoberfest,3.71,a: the beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has hues of orange along with a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation. it poured with a short white head that quickly settled down and left a thin collar around the edge of the glass. s: moderate aromas of sweet malts are present in the nose. t: the taste follows the smell but is also accompanied by a moderate amount of bitterness and hints of spiciness from the hops. m: it feels a bit more than light-bodied and a bit crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. there is some dryness in the finish. o: this beer seems to be much lighter in body compared to other beers in the style. its easy to drink but not as malty.  serving type: can
858,Oktoberfest,4.04,in a can- hearty and flavorful. big taste almost ale like. decent brew especially in a cold day
859,Black Gold,4.7,2022 bottle split among friends. l: pours jet black no head very thin edge foam no carbo visible clinging of beer to sides of glass. s: chocolate cherry black forest chocolate moist cake a hint of coffee toffee a halo of barrel. t: taste follows nose and is sweet. chocolate molasses bourbon. deeply roasted flavor without char. there are suggestions of dark berries raisins dates. f: smooth silky heavy bodied with a long slick finish. it is very lightly oily. o: an amazing tasting and drinking beer. gushing with chocolate cake flavor and is a sipper. soft bourbon and a silky feel and finish make this world class in its style.
860,Black Gold,4.07,dark brown pour looks black in the glass; thin head. nutty woody smell. rich dark malt taste; boozy; wheat. heavy body; smooth; very warm.  damn good!  bottling info: 2022 source: bottle share in sheboygan wi with multiple other bas may 12th 2023 (review based on notes)
861,Black Gold,4.75,#136 yum!
862,Black Gold,4.6,2022 bottle; pours jet black with a thin head. lots of barrel character on the nose. cold the flavors are chocolate on the front barrel on the back. warmer the flavors integrate to barrel chocolate and bourbon. wonderful.
863,Black Gold,4.53,not getting much bourbon but the barrel wood is really coming through. at first it seemed a tad bitter or tannic but ten minutes or so of breathing mellowed that. very easy to drink. solid all around. thirty minutes out there’s more sweetness and a bit more bourbon vibe. the base stout is for lack of better description and palate a savory type not sweet or chocolatey. buy it if you see it.
864,Black Gold,3.82,i don’t get any bourbon barrel character whatsoever. extremely roasty character.
865,O'Doul's,3.11,from the bottle it pours a clear light yellow color with nice white head that slowly reduces. the nose gets alight dose of grassy hops. the mouth gets an initial burst of grass followed by a gentle smooth feeling very lightly malt flavored brew.
866,O'Doul's,2,the only positive thing i can say about this stuff is that its better than coors light! way back when we were younger my buddy and i used to by cases of this stuff dump it and replace it with bud so his girlfriend would think he wasnt getting drunk. those were the days. of course we had to have a few real bottles now and then.
867,O'Doul's,3.06,poured from an undated 12oz can into a smaller antique coors glass  on the pour 1 finger of perfectly average head formed then recedes pretty quickly to a decent cap. the body is your typical aal color with fine medium carbonation.  aroma is like sex in a canoe.... after eating a single peanut i cant pick up much of anything at all. at least its clean i guess. some slight corn way off in the distance.  taste is stronger than the aroma but not by much. super light but at the same time it is super clean as well. some corny malt off in the background again but slightly stronger. tastes like corn flakes steeped in carbonated water.  feel is bigger than the taste and aroma suggest with the actual feel of beer as opposed to budweiser zero which feels like beer flavored soda. medium short finish with a mouthcoating feel. carbonation mixed with the decent head is a big driving force here.  overall i wish anhueser busch would get it together and make a beer with the feel of this and the taste of budweiser zero or at least make this have more flavor. if the taste was stronger it would remind me a lot of tivoli outlaw lager.
868,O'Doul's,5,best non alcoholic beverage ever for us nonalcoholic drinkers.
869,O'Doul's,2.4,very mild straw colored slightly sweet. doesnt have the bitter taste of a lot of the other mass market non-alcoholic beers.
870,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.19,pours a deep dark brown color with a finger of tan head. the nose has notes of milk chocolate syrup and the chocolate notes carry over in the flavor.  this is a fine effort but compared to other th milk stouts in the same abv range it is incredibly average.
871,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.5,16 oz can stamped: “summer 2023” drank: 7/7/23  look- dark with tan head  smell - sweet milk chocolate and vanilla  taste - dark roasty and malty with a slightly burnt coffee finish. not nearly as sweet as it smells in a good way. coffee finish  feel - not thick not thin creamy mouthfeel  overall - quite enjoyable. expected it to be much sweeter like most treehouse milk stouts but this one was not overly sweet and very drinkable
872,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.27,pours very dark with an appropriately large foamy mocha head. aroma is sweet chocolate maple syrup. flavor is sweet maple syrup light chocolate vanilla light coffee. creamy texture. overall a delicious imperial milk stout.  5/28/22 16 oz can dated 4/9/21 4.25 rating
873,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",4.51,** 06/04/21  can to tumbler; share complements of dc.  look: big thick black. beautiful tan head. excellent retention.  aroma: a lot of maple. brown sugar light roasts.  taste: caramel. fudge. very sweet even a little too much but super tasty.  feel: excellent carbonation for such a thick beer. really nice.  **
874,Taddy Porter,4.06,poured from a 12-oz bottle (undated) into a pint glass.  appearance: very dark brown with a large tan head that only gradually reduced but still left a portion and plenty of lacing.  nose: roasted malt sweet raisin maybe a bit of brown sugar.  mouthfeel: medium thick smooth adequate carbonation.  attack: follows the nose pretty closely; very gentle just the slightest hint of spice.  finish: a bit of bitterness from the hops and dark roast just to balance.  overall: this is an extremely drinkable brew and would pair well with any meat. the gentleness of this (and other) english porters is a nice occasional change from the sometimes more full-flavored but also more bitter american porters which i also love. im enjoying it.
875,Taddy Porter,4.06,pours a nice dark black colour with a thin head when all is settled. nose (to me) is hard water about it. taste is roasty (but not overly) finishes slightly bitter. some cocoa notes also on finish.
876,Taddy Porter,3.95,pours a dark brownish color with a half finger of head. the nose has some mild roasty notes but thats about it. the flavor has some modest roasted bitterness accompanied by a touch of molasses and smoke. that said the lack of heartiness somewhat drags the whole flavor profile down.
877,Taddy Porter,4.55,from a bottle. black with a half inch of fluffy brown head. nutty roasted malt aroma. medium body. nutty roasted malt with a lasting earthy bitterness. excellent
878,Taddy Porter,4.57,this is a really nice brew. very relaxed buzz and drinkable. i dont think i can justify buying this one over something similar like maduro brown ale or newcastle. and although i found this beer in a 4 pack but at the price of a craft sixer i cant hold that against it because it is very good.  if you like a stout beverage this one is worth trying... or if you just want something a bit classy and sophisticated.
879,Taddy Porter,4.17,550ml bottle. l: very dark brown almost black with a thick and creamy mocha-coloured head and sheets of lacing. s: rich and toasty. becomes more fruity as it warms. t: milky coffee cocoa dried figs some charring. nicely dry rather than outright bitter. f: medium/light body foaming carbonation velvet soft mouthfeel. o: a classic porter in the traditional style. lovely stuff.
880,Taddy Porter,5,fantastic! world class. pricey but worth it. i guess i have to add more words to make it submit as a review. odd rule by the beer advocate web master.
881,Taddy Porter,4.26,appearance: pours a jet black with a off-white foam head. decent retention.  aroma: very aromatic. clean crisp toffee. raisins and dark fruit.  taste: sweet malts chocolate raisins dark fruit. a little bit of caramel with a clean finish.  overall: wow. quite refreshing. the aroma gives me an instant rush of crisp freshness that i havent had in many beers. the taste follows. this is an amazing porter.
882,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.02,i love the intensity. it is a treat.
883,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.1,notes from 2011-12. 12oz bottle into a pint glass. l: copper fairly clear. lite tan head. s: caramel candy earthy and fruity. t: malty sweet with a fine hop bite that doesnt go too far. some pine lingers. f: fairly smooth drinking with a medium heavy mouthfeel. on par with lagunitas. o: reminds me of a christmas ale but not as bitter. excellent.
884,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.36,355 ml bottle cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 9.6% og 1085 ibu 66.6. beautiful amber to copper colour moderate off-white head. strong aroma of fruity american hops old marmalade caramel and crystal malts alcohol. the flavour is very sweet and the alcohol is not well hidden but soon overpowered by a massive hoppy attack. warming mouth- and throatfeel.maybe too much of everything but still a guilty pleasure to drink.
885,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.93,the pour from a tap into a plain pint glass brings an amber-brown fluid closest to 16 on the srm chart. theres a nice light biege head atop but attention quickly shifts to the enticing malty hop aroma. there is rich body here as evidenced by all the pretty glass lacing. the initial taste is good malty but with some hop contributions. what kills the enjoyment is the cloyingly sweet after taste. if a honey like finish to a beer sounds good here it is.
886,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4,12 oz bottle pours a deep amber in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass. strong hop aromas of grapefruit and pine. full bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel. flavors of pine and grapefruit. more of a strong ipa.
887,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.91,this here is the one that turned me onto american pale ales.  i think apa is now my favorite beer and its thanks to undercover investigation shutdown and others like it.  doesnt look or smell too special but it tastes like a million bucks. for the high abv you mostly just taste the hops and it is delish.  one of my top 5 beers i always look for and enjoy in season.  great job lagunitas!
888,Big Bad Baptist,4.24,pours jet black with low tan head.  smell is roasted with notes of coffee coffee grounds dark chocolate and tobacco.  taste is roasted and a bit sweet with notes of coffee chocolate bourbon and vanilla. some hints of cured meat and a bit of bitterness.  mouthfeel is medium soft and well carbonated.  overall a very nice pretty laid back impy.
889,Big Bad Baptist,4.38,pored great it went exceptionally well with a cigarette. very thick and strong bodied but not in a bad way. my only complaint is that the head takes forever to dissipate regardless of how you pour.  for taste i have to give it a 9/10 honestly one of the best bottle of beers i have ever had.
890,Big Bad Baptist,4.49,pours a dark brown black with a little tan head. the aroma kills; chocolate coffee bourbon with the taste those same qualities with a strong presence from the barrel it’s like fbs on steroids delicious and oh so easy to drink at this high abv. epic has a winner with this one and will definitely keep an eye peeled for this in the future!
891,Big Bad Baptist,4.63,look: poured from a 12oz can into a sniffer - jet black pour with about a fingers length of foam risen to the surface. a bit of lacing is left behind as it dissolves back into liquid form. pours quite thin for a 11.8%. smell: getting big notes of chocolate - rich baking chocolate. getting some caramel and toffee as well as some molasses too. not to much on the coffee notes here or bourbon/whiskey either. taste: first you get a coffee aromic taste followed by the chocolatey that backs it up. the thing that stands out the most is definitely the chocolate. im getting hints of oaky-ness and vanilla as well. its rich yet not to heavy in a sense that you can drink it easily. the alcohol is very well hidden and thats surprising being a 11.8% beer. i didnt get much of a whiskey taste in this and this might be due to ageing it for months in a barrel vs some places do years. even though the whiskey/ bourbon barrels arent to present but its a very good sipper. feel: this is so smooth that you cant even tell its a heavy beer. its not chewy or oily at all very light carbonation - might throw a lot of people off by this alone yet so smooth. easy sipper for sure. overall: i was hesitant paying the price for a four pack but man im glad i got to experience this. ill definitely be buying again and even aging some to see how it turns out.
892,Big Bad Baptist,4,smell is huuuge spicy bourbon notes chocolate marshmallow and a hint of coffee. taste is plenty of bourbon coffee and dark chocolate with oaky hints. i think the feel is what throws me off. very nice heat behind it but not as thick or as carbonated as expected. overall i think the feel distracts from the taste a bit which is too bad because the balance of coffee and bourbon is phenomenal.
893,Big Bad Baptist,4.46,pours out a black color with a beige head. smell is of whiskey coffee dark chocolate and malt. the taste is of whiskey coffee cocoa dark chocolate malt oak and vanilla. very good and i had this one for breakfast along with my usual straight black cup of coffee. great!! ill be drinking more of this type for sure.
894,Big Bad Baptist,4.62,12 ounce can into an epic snifter poured at 50°. deep night black with a generous finger of dense foam. smell on the spin is coffee up front malt sweetness right behind. taste is roasty malt fresh pulled espresso rich dark cacao sweet tobacco. the bourbon barrel is subtle but present. coffee is the star of this show. feel is smooth decadently rich light to medium carbonation. overall: beautifully smooth coffee stout sipper very well-executed and balanced. one of anerica’s best.
895,Big Bad Baptist,4.43,pours black gloriously dark with a wondrous two finger head of nicely bubbled foam. aroma is strongly coffee and dark chocolate. i could smell this brew all day. taste is not as carbonated as i thought a light chocolate than anticipated and the coffee is likewise present but subdued. none of this is truly as bad as it sounds but is noticeable. this is very pleasant and for this abv very drinkable. an easy to like imperial stout.
896,Big Bad Baptist,3.8,rel #101. pours a dark dark brown with a faint hint of red. fully opaque in the glass with a think khaki colored head that quickly receded to a long-lasting cap. aroma is really nice. rich chocolate dominates while the coffee and whiskey barrels have faded.  taste is almost the opposite of the nose. no direct coffee notes but plenty of roast and some really nice barrel flavors. theres not much in the way of sweetness but thats not at all a bad thing. this beer is several years old and while i cant attest to what it tastes like fresh it has a certain balanced mellowness to it that im really enjoying. full bodied and smooth going down.
897,Big Bad Baptist,3,might have gotten one of the bad batches(2020 is all i remember). had a weird sour note i couldnt shake. got a little better as it warmed but not much. definitely wont be buying again. disappointing
898,Viking Blod,4.24,300 ml bottle no dating on it that i noticed. served in a chalice the mead pours a dark gold/amber color. its more mead than beer to me its still so no lacing or carbonation. aroma is nice it smells like honey hibiscus earthiness ginger and some herbal hops. taste is pretty much just like the aroma but i think the honey stands out somewhat compared to the other flavors without overpowering them. mouthfeel/body is full its syrupy and slick with pretty much no carbonation. doesnt seem like its 19% abv either. i thought this was a good overall braggot wouldnt mind trying this again in the future. worth a try for sure!
899,Viking Blod,3.84,i feel like i was tricked into drinking mead. but the name and bottle is bad ass so i\m fine with it! never have i had a 19% braggot before yet this is surprisingly drinkable with a lighter but very viscous boozy body slight dark graininess accenting. smell features hibiscus grape schnapps with honey and leaves and a hint of earth. taste as it smells but not schnapps thankfully much more gentle red sweet grape adheres to the plum finish is boozy flower. a time capsule of a beer that holds up decently
900,Viking Blod,4.28,300ml bottle (shared) into a small goblet. no idea on age but doubt it matters. fairly recent arrival at my usual bottle shop.  looks very nice. glowing amber honey body faintly hazy. no head or lacing of course.  lovely floral sweet aroma seems very well balanced.  on tasting sweet without being cloying or syrupy. the light floral notes are very pleasant. featherlight ginger hit. hops are hard to detect but maybe part of a beautifully balanced drink.  mouth between medium and full finish warming sweet faint spice. loving the finish very relaxing.  overall a finely crafted and thought out drink. pricey but worth it on special occasions.
901,Viking Blod,4.79,look: amber no carbonation  smell: honey floral  taste: sweet and complex very nice  feel: good aftertaste  overall: really good this is a wine though not a beer
902,Viking Blod,3.52,no date but this one is about 12-14 years old. picked this up in va a looong time ago.  the pour has zero carbonation. like none. basically a wine.  aroma is alcohol and honey maybe some pineapple?  this one is so sweet. i already feel the hangover. lots of honey lots of alcohol maybe some lavender and clover?  this mf is strong and tasty. i am alone and drinking this but i would recommend splitting between three or four of your besties. a really sweet dessert beer.
903,Viking Blod,4.53,look: auburn carmel opague smell: ethanol at first sweet fruitiness grassy sweet sour smell taste: earth fruitiness honey sweet strawberry some slight hoppy bitterness on the end sweetness stays on the tongue for awhile feel: syrupy overall: a delight with a cool name!
904,Viking Blod,4.36,from a 750ml ceramic bottle with no legible freshness date into a perfect pint glass. it’s a hazy golden color with zero head or carbonation. nice smells pleasantly of honey with perhaps some alcohol and clove-like spice. taste is very sweet with strong alcohol presence. not exactly honey flavored but kind of like a fruity syrup with a little bit of musky scuppernong type flavor. a bit of black tea simple syrup raisins butter. a little bitter but no distinguishable hops character. quite complex. as others have mentioned alcohol is very well masked. mouth is like diluted syrup sticky yet smooth and quenching. overall very good; i’ve had mead before and this is probably the best i’ve tried. still it’s a bit too syrupy sweet for me; i think i’d enjoy a slightly more attenuated sweetness. and at about $25 us this is a once and done for me.
905,Viking Blod,4.16,first and foremost - to all the other reviewers who are saying this isnt beer. - that is correct. it is mead they are nothing alike as this is a honey wine. it just so happens to also have hops and other sundries within as well. honestly that combats the overly sweet taste common in many meads without having to resort to a champagne yeast base. this mead is sweet yet a bit tart with the hop and hibiscus while the apricot smooths the transition between the two.  the taste profile has a hint of molasses but i believe that comes from the hibiscus/apricot combined with the honey. i believe they may put a bit more honey in the brew after the fermentation process to make it so lovingly syrupy. slick move really!  surprisingly this is a great mead. a little pricey here ~$25us especially with a few meaderys close to where i live. the average mead goes for about 12-15% alcohol while this one tops off at 19% you really can not tell it is so high. when i brew mead i usually go for 15-18% so this one hits the spot for me.  if this is your first mead experience i would suggest going with a more simple brew keeping the more complex varieties (flavors so many to choose from!) for after your first bottle.  yes i would recommend it and i will be drinking this again.
906,Viking Blod,3.99,first of all i have to give this mead a 5 for the coolest name. appearance: a lovely golden color. aroma: just about perfect with honey maple & hibiscus. flavor is sweet & complex with hops that misses the mark of what appeals to me. i found vikinggernes mjod much closer to what i’m looking for in a mead. feel is silky smooth & it’s 19% is well hidden. it’s is certainly enjoyable & worth trying but at $30 a bottle i probably won’t be buying more.
907,Viking Blod,4.55,first time tasting mead and i have to say i was not disappointed! the nose on this mead was amazing. strong spicy smell to it that matches the color of the drink. golden honey like consistency that matched the taste and texture of every sip. goes down pretty warm not spicy and not hard to take. the alcohol content of 19% was never tasted but for sure felt afterwards. and even then i wanted more. i wouldnt consider this a beer tho more like a strong sweet wine or a light sweet liquor. will for sure be buying a few bottles to drink over the years. good job dansk mjod. sadly it is no longer brewed.
908,Viking Blod,4.03,i drank viking blod from my 1 liter disneyland cup. the alcohol level is high it is deceptively drinkable it is very sweet the bottle is big and yes youll get buzzed.  look: semi-clear light brown and red with a thin quickly disappearing white head  aroma: honey maybe hibiscus  taste: the flavor is honey lots of honey with hint of hibiscus and grapefruit like hops but mostly honey. the amazing thing is that the high alcohol level is not very noticeable.  body/overall: thick viscous body easy drinking for the alcohol level.
909,Reaction State,4.9,#150 yummy!
910,Reaction State,4.5,2022 version poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a plastic cup. my day 12 beer for bottle logic 12 days of christmas. nice thickness. excellent blend of vanilla maple and coffee.
911,Reaction State,3.5,cinnamon is becoming my kryptonite so i’m hoping it’s been used with an appropriately light touch in this 500ml bottle ‘cause i like everything else added to this brute.  hard black with a few stray brown bubbles that quiet swiftly. oh oh. cinnamon bite is strong on the nose. please no brew deities.  reaction state tiptoes along the abyss of cinnamon gorge. cinnamon is straddling the beer but doesn’t quite crush it into submission. underneath the spice are touches of maple vanilla & the ghost of cocoas past. light bourbon winds its way betwixt & between & the finish is mulled apple cider. should have split this one with my wife.  hey brewers: quit putting so much fucking cinnamon in your beers. if you can’t get the balance right throw the crap away. pretty good beer which is sad as i can sense something really good underneath the cinnamon avalanche.
912,Reaction State,4.57,pours a dark brown like motor oil. just a half of a finger of dark brown head shows up and disappears just as quickly.  nose is a walloping of bourbon barrel aged stout. its got that rich dense still wet barrel level of intensity. huge oak profile. i love it. next is the roasted malt and a strong presence of chocolate. this reminds me a little of one of my favorites of all time; weyerbachers chocolate pretzel sunday morning stout. then in the background there lies the cinnamon.  taste is much of the same on the nose. oak bourbon roasted malt chocolate cinnamon. but now i get the slight bit of maple syrup. maple syrup presents almost with i hesitate to say this but a sour note when its put in stouts sometimes. like an extremely subtle tartness or tanginess. it doesnt detract but it is a unique quality. the tannins from the barrel kind of leave that soapy flavor that also sometimes tends to happen in these barrel aged stouts. its incredibly mild and doesnt linger but thats why i decided to put it at a 4.5 rather than 4.75 similar to the nose.  mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. brief flash of carbonation right at the beginning. abv makes its presence known but not as severely as that maumasi i had the other night. there is a little bit of drying but not harsh on the palate or on the way down.  overall my favorite bottle logic brew so far. i was surprised because i though this was just going to be another breakfast stout but this one actually blew me away. well balanced and all the flavors work well with each other and don\t feel like novelty additions. masterclass level stuff.
913,Reaction State,4.54,opaque midnight black pour with a finger of brown foam. smells of big coffee and maple forward nose with vanilla chocolate and molasses accents. taste is incredible hype meeting even: coffee rich dark chocolate molasses and the difference lush bourbon before vanilla cinnamon and bigger maple elevate to a finish with espresso biscotti and a lingering caramel nougat. lush rich smooth full and decently thick with good barrel warmth and coffee percolation.
914,Spotted Cow,4,a: slight haze; medium gold in color; 1 finger finely pored ivory head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;  s: funky lemon orange and clove;  t: yeast driven flavor that follows the nose; mild to moderate bitterness at the end;  m: light to medium bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish;  o: very enjoyable; easy drinking; refreshing; would pair well with a wide variety of foods;
915,Spotted Cow,4.45,a perennial favorite. this has a nice robust flavor while still maintaining a certain lightness to the beer. if youre not expecting the bottle conditioning the yeast you find in the bottle might gross you out but it makes for a delicious beer.
916,Spotted Cow,4.21,claims to be a farmhouse ale taste like a cream ale. nice summer beer could drink all day long and not feel bloated. picked up a case at total wine after stopping at brewery. this one you will remember- best selling beer in wi and only available there as well
917,Spotted Cow,3.75,1 pint draft poured into shaker glass at dugout 54 in milwaukee. very quickly dissipating head. light mild taste highly sessionable beer. not much hoppiness or maltiness.
918,Spotted Cow,4.55,tried this for the first time as a draft beer. smell great and had a nice light finish.
919,Green,4.64,darker yellow very hazy pour. lots of citrus and pine on the nose. flavor follows suit but adds a touch of pineapple. strong bitterness follows leaving you wanting more.
920,Green,4.27,this is another treehouse that varies a fair amount in taste due to either a) batch or time (measured by the week) or b) day to day based on my particular taste buds. that said it is always good but sometimes it is fabulous.
921,Green,4.79,4 pack from sandwich location. look is hazy dark yellow to orange. taste is a little more bitter than sweet. pine tropical fruit (mango/ papaya mainly) and some citrus. mouthfeel is medium bodied and soft. overall a great ne ipa plain and simple.
922,Green,3.25,probably my least favorite of ths ipa but stillgood and in a blast bette than most. this one seemed less juicy to me and more plain of an ipa but not one id eve turn down.
923,Green,4.33,look - thick tannish orange with a big lasting sticky white head and lacing smell - green... smells green! fresh pineapple citrus orange/tangerine taste - that has a lot going on! pineapple orange like the smell along with way more... more bitter than almost all ne hazy beers with a slight grassy/pine feel - medium body with a medium slightly light carb and a lil fluff overall - great blend between a great ne and a great w. coast. kind of has both
924,Green,4.9,#157 yum!
925,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.4,dark and rich complex and earthy. oaky bready with texture and beautiful complexity. aromas and tastes of banana bread slight cloves and pecan with a crisp finish then rich aftertaste. dark mahogany and rich luxurious mouth feel. gorgeous.
926,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.9,my personal favorite from weihenstephaner and my favorite dunkel overall. sometimes it’s a little different to locate locally but it’s a solid choice that i buy whenever i see it. if you like dunkles try it you’ll love it.
927,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.41,malty with a noticeable banana flavor. definitely an outstanding beer that anyone can enjoy.
928,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,3.88,6/15/23 anniversary trip to athens oh. found this surprise treat at the kroger!  beautiful deep amber/light copper color in the glass. nice creamy tan head.  aroma is slightly sour brown bread brown sugar spice bush malt mineral.  bright and light in the mouth not as full bodied as expected.  sweet and malty can just get the over ripe banana and bubble gum flavors. finishes caramel and slightly metallic.  reading through some other reviews we are wondering if this bottle has been on the shelf too long. its not matching up as well as we had expected.  from date code (1412) im thinking this beer was made mid october of 2022. sat in cooler for 8 months...ugh.
929,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.55,tastes like a darker version of a hefe weissen
930,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,5,awesome!
931,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.23,500ml bottle. dark amber with a light brown head that dissapears fairly quickly. nice rich mouthfeel. banana and caramel. medium to light carbonation. very nice.
932,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.43,banana freshly baked bread crust caramel very slight floral noble hop honey-like maltiness low bitterness so damn smooth and crushable. awesome brew!
933,St. Pauli N. A.,2.39,12 oz bottle poured straight from the fridge into a nonic.  pours a medium gold with a 1.5 finger staying white head leaving a good film of lacing.  initial aroma is very much skunk and marijuana even upon opening the bottle. other than that all i can really say is it smells like a lager years and crisp.  taste is very much sweet malt with some bitterness and not much else. the sweetness is surprisingly very high being slightly fruity but very much a caramel malt flavor tasting light in color. the aftertaste comprises strongly bitter hops and the afformentioned sweetness both present on the back of the top of the tongue.  mouthfeel is thin and watery but also crisp and slightly fluffy. honestly not bad despite the drawbacks.  overall not terrible but nothing to write home about. its a macro.  not going to buy again but worth it to try once.
934,St. Pauli N. A.,2.84,appearance - pours clear and light yellow with a white half finger width head. not much for lacing.  smell - light skunk malty sweetness and faint whiffs of grain and grass.  taste - follows the nose. cereal malt sweetness slight grain and a touch of grassy hops. sweetness dominates the aftertaste.  mouthfeel - light in body with moderate bitey carbonation. slick drinker with a crisp finish.  overall - its okay for what it is but the sweetness makes it hard to drink more than a few of these before moving onto something else.
935,St. Pauli N. A.,3.07,st pauli na. pours clear golden with a two-finger snow-white head that left great lacing. nose is malty. taste is sweet malt with slight bitterness. mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated and watery. overall good.
936,St. Pauli N. A.,2.88,extremely low expectations for this one pours a fizzy foamy 1 finger head with good retention a bit of lacing crystal clear light pale watery color  nose light cereal grain and mild skunk dank skunky note malt water a little herbal hop maybe? not as bad as expected other than skunk  taste brings more stale cereal grain water and skunky straw mild skunk dank like and skunk is only mild touch of bitterness and herbal hop dry finish with med bitterness and a hint astringent  mouth is lighter bod med carb  overall not a great beer but not as bad as i expected a bit like malt water but somewhat typical for na beers only mild skunky note which when i had the original it was crazy skunk thanks to the green bottle
937,St. Pauli N. A.,3.8,(12 oz green bottle freshest before 02.2022; purchased single off shelf at roger wilco pennsauken... poured into a 14 oz mug)  l: brilliantly-clear pale gold liquid; foam forms on the pour but breaks up in chunklets... no lace  s: somehow a little skunky wet coins and/or vinyl siding wet forest hint of doughy biscuity malt  t: all of those aromas are pretty much exactly what i get on the palate with the malt of course opening up taking over the flavors... bit of back end grassy bitterness and perhaps a hint of toasty smoke that helps establish a little balance and depth  f: medium-bodied a bit sluggish flowing through but ends with a nice tickle of carbonation giving way to the soft stunning hum of hop bitterness... about standard for its ilk  o: overall not too bad... base flavors are about standard; the bit of bitterness there certainly provides a touch of interest... i could do this one on the regular if need be (1912)
938,St. Pauli N. A.,2.87,this one pours a crystal clear golden color. thinner one finger velvety white head. average retention. aroma is skunky sweet grain slight honey and some grassy hops.  taste follows the nose with strong notes of sweet malty grains dried hay grassy hops. it is quite skunked which should not be surprising since it is in a green bottle.still its skunked enough that it is actively distracting. feel is light crisp moderate carbonation.  overall this one is ok. it is too skunked to really enjoy but seems to do a solid job capturing the essence of the regular version.
939,St. Pauli N. A.,1.86,12oz bottle - review from notes  this is a good beer but a terrible na beer. i dont know what they lost in translation but this tastes like funky water. there are much better na options these days  this needs alcohol to be worth drinking
940,St. Pauli N. A.,3.56,goes down smooth with just a light tinge of noble hop variety. vegetal aftertaste some grass and a slight bitterness. cereal grain malts. overall this is what one would expect of the style and i would drink it again.
941,Places I've Been,4.79,what a collaborative! a surprising dbl ipa onto your taste palette. i loved it from the 16oz can.
942,Places I've Been,4.34,tasted on draft at the craft bar fort walton beach fl.  good hazy ipa appearance. not too much head. great aromas and flavors of grapefruit and lighter tropical notes. there is strong hops bitterness but it is not overpowering and seems restrained for the hops flavors and aromas. warming alcohol level.  this is a big delicious hazy ipa.
943,Places I've Been,4.13,hazy deep gold pour with white head of mixed bubbles; excellent cap retention; solid ring soapy lace. slightly dank nose. mild tropical fruit juice flavors. medium light body moderate carbonation; no astringency; dusty tongue coating. overall another “hazylite” unfiltered american dipa.
944,Places I've Been,4.03,this is my least favorite brew i have had from this amazing brewer .... that said it is still quite good ... heavy and citrusy... i just don\t concur with the outstanding label placed upon it .... but it\s no slight to be just an ok beer from a top tier brewery
945,Places I've Been,4.25,places ive been pours a darker hazy orangish color with a good-sized lasting head. the aroma is dank; vegetable notes the flavor is the same with dank vegetable notes and good solid and bold flavors. good feel. overall a classic dank ipa with lots of flavors.
946,Places I've Been,4.05,16oz can. stamped on can bottom is pkg 06/12/23. cloudy pale gold colored body. various sizes of sediment. two fingers of white head. leaves behind spots and strings of lacing. aroma of orange grapefruit pineapple and pine resin. taste is overripe fruit - orange papaya pineapple and grapefruit. dank with pine resin. bitterness level is low. medium mouth feel with a softer texture. recognizable astringency; drying finish. very good carbonation. wets the whistle but has a tea-like finish.
947,Places I've Been,3.99,16 oz can into a pint glass. l: pours hazy med-dark orange with a 1/2 off white head low carbo ok head retention random spotty sticky lacing. s: tropical fruits melon pineapple berries citrus. t: tropical fruits melon citrus very lightly dank melon rind tastes lightly green fruit-wise. f: gently sharp smooth medium-heavy feel with a slightly drying finish. feels like most all other tg dipas. o: a nice fruity dipa. ez drinking pleasant feel. it tastes very similar to many of tgs dipas that its splitting hairs. not distinctive imho in any way. pretty average for tg. it is very good in its style.
948,Tynt Meadow,4.18,bottle purchased and drank at apothecary ale house in morgantown wv.  this one pours a dark-ish golden brown color with a small white head and a little bit of lacing.  this smells like licorice peat breadiness caramel dark chocolate and some dark fruit.  this feels pretty dang spot on for the style. there’s a nice earthy sweetness some spice some fig and raisin dark fruit notes with a nice chocolatey creamy finish.  this is medium bodied creamy with a nice warming feel to it.  it’s fun to get a completely spot on take on this style from a trappist brewery.
949,Tynt Meadow,3.97,poured from 330ml bottle into a dimpled mug. date on the bottle is 7/27/24 so im going to assume thats a best-by date. the label says its made in a place called coalville which ... seems legit.  appearance: rich red-brown hue with plenty of haze and a finger of creamy tan foam with a bit of an amber cast. looks good!  smell: quite sweet with a nutty caramelly and biscuity malt element. i must say although it seems well-made its not particularly catered to my taste.  taste: sweet caramelly perhaps even with a hint of toffee. theres that biscuity finish which im not as much of a fan of. this is definitely a sweet malty treat. i like it although its not perfect.  mouthfeel: medium body with a good carbonation and a nice smooth creaminess. actually the creaminess is more than good -- its quite lovely indeed!  overall: i mean i generally dont like biscuity beers. but this one holds most of that particular character in the aroma so ill give it a little bit of a pass. a nice dessert beer.
950,Tynt Meadow,4,lots going on in this one hard to pick out all the flavors. most of them are subtle nothing overwhelming. but its definitely a malty beer with bread and caramel. a slight feel of alcohol. dark brown medium/high carbonation. i would need another one to appreciate it better.
951,Tynt Meadow,4.16,poured from the 375 ml bottle dated 27/07/24 into the test glass. a - deep cooper mahagony color gentle pour yields a thin off white cap. during the experience a steady production keeps a ring alive clinging to the glass. s - brown sugar a bit of anise sweet malt dark fruit  primarily raisin. there is a spicy thread in there not quite pepper not quite yeasty ester but its there. t - candied dark sugar some licorice again with that peppery thread with a warm up a really nice plum aspect develops m - sweet start stays in the lanes fully coats the palate. just on the edge of sticky. a nice dry finish o - a very good trappist with all the elements. make no mistake it leans hard to english strong ale. the peppery yeast and dark fruit keep this lovely offering strongly in thr trappsit camp
952,Tynt Meadow,4.11,pours a somewhat cloudy amber-brown and then full cloudy with a lot of yeast sediment; opaque in the glass; thin yet lasting light khaki colored head. nice spicy nose; star anise and licorice; candi sugar sweetness smell; light suggestion of raisins. spicy malty flavors; anise red licorice and candi sugar; cloves; light cocoa on the backend; a touch booziness; very mild bitterness. heavy mouthfeel; thick and sticky on the palate; a touch of boozy warmth.  other than a bit of over-carbonation overflow (likely due to the beer not being that cold - must have been just added to the stores coolers) there are no major flaws with this beer. ill be back to pick up another sample and let it sit in the fridge a few days before re-trying the beer. i love the complexity and mouthfeel of this beer. a very nice find. the beer buyer guy said this is the only true trappist beer brewed in the uk.  pouring temperature: 63 °f: bottling info: source: local purchase (coaltrain fine wine craft beer & spirits)
953,Tynt Meadow,3.98,look: it pours brown with a tan head. head retention is good.  smell: it has caramel and spicy aromas up front. there are some bread crust elements with some figs and licorice.  taste: there are caramel and toffee flavors with quite a bit of spiciness. there are a bit of figs and other dark fruits in support.  feel: it has a medium full body with some alcohol warming.  overall an interesting beer that features plenty of malt with strong spiciness in both the aroma and flavor.
954,Tynt Meadow,4.1,330ml bottle - $6.49 at total wine & more in kennesaw georgia.  appearance: pours a not-altogether-clear tawny brown body with an off-white head.  smell: lush caramel cooked brown sugar laced with a little nibble of chocolate and instant coffee powder. perfumy wafts of spice-studded fruitcake soaked in a little sherry.  taste: caramelized sweet sugars and cocoa powder curtailed by a shot of roasty coffee and a nutty earthy quality. pop of spiciness and bitter orange amidst the panettone laced with raisins and dates and chestnuts. a return of that hearty roast with a bit of vanilla. warming sweetish earthy finish.  mouthfeel: medium-full body. medium carbonation.  overall: a trappist-style beer with some english leanings. bathe in its deliciousness.
955,Tynt Meadow,4.02,a - pours a murky amber with a large fizzy off white head. the head fades into a thin ring leaving light spotty lacing  s - aroma is plums dark cherry and chocolate.  t - the taste is chocolate coffee raisins figs dark cherries caramel white pepper and a lingering bitter finish.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. creamy mouthfeel with a nice soft finish.  o - solid.
956,Tynt Meadow,4.18,tynt meadow (2023)  mount saint bernard abbey strong ale english  smells of tangy chocolate and bing cherries. the yeast is earthy bitter and sour but very nice and unique. super smooth feel. bakers chocolate covered raisins and fruity esters roll on heavy. super clean spring water body with earthy and bitter fin  4.20  bottle
957,Tynt Meadow,4.25,english trappist ale is a great description for this newcomer because youve never had an english trappist ale before and so this is a new/unique experience. more english influences than a belgian more belgian influences than a english strong. i loved the unique complexity in the nose the taste and the finnish. i hope the monks of st bernard have a successful launch and look forward to additional offerings.
958,Tynt Meadow,4.29,a: pours a dark ruby red color that is nearly opaque. a dense beige head forms that last forever light lace is left as this finally and gently recedes. s: the aroma is all malts and incredibly nuanced. fresh baked bread toasted malts light chocolate covered cherries. the dark fruit character lingers on a bit. incredibly inviting and welcoming. t: like the nose all the malty characteristics are there and great. baked bread dark fruits chocolate brown/caramelized sugars. just a touch of earthy hoppiness for which helps keep this form being cloying in anyway. m/o: a medium body with moderate carbonation. if there is any fault here this could be a bit fuller. though that just makes it all the easier to drink and it is smooth sweet but not too sweet and just all around warming and moreish.  a great nuanced malt character that doesnt become cloying and is just spot on english in every way. i have been missing these kinds of english strong ales and ill be coming back to this one a lot. well until it inevitably becomes scarce and you cant find it anymore on the shelve. until then im going to enjoy this as much as i can.
959,Tynt Meadow,4.52,poured from bottle into tulip good 2+ finger tight bubbled light tan head great retention and lacing. dark ruby in the glass not light passes thru really exceptional looking beer. big malt on the nose toffee caramel and dark fruit comes to mind. taste follows the nose big sweet malt in the front with a good strong carbonation to pull it back in along with a good heavy hand on the bitterness. as it warms the flavors start to come out caramel toffee roasted malt on the front with dark dried fruits figs raisins floating around the background. i will take an english strong on this but it is teetering between english and american barley wine. man it is 100 degrees during the day and 85 at night and i am drinking this thinking it is truly a great winter beer but it is hitting the spot now
960,Tynt Meadow,4.75,07/18/23 bottle @ winking lizard peninsula
961,Backwoods Bastard,4.74,this is one of my favorite beers on planet earth. it has it all and i buy it any chance i get. it really does sip similar to a single malt scotch which is great because i had to swear off my whisky fetish awhile back. beer makes me behave much better. i get the typical notes of vanilla caramel and toffee from the bourbon barrels and it has a bit more sweetness than similar beers which i personally love. not too much but just right. lastly the mouthfeel on this beer is top notch. i cannot recommend a beer more than this one.
962,Backwoods Bastard,4,335 ml bottle (bottled on 4/10/23). samoled on 8/17/23 looks dark like stout on initial pour. red highlights bubbles when held under light smells boozy due to 11% abv taste is dark bitter chocolate scotchy notes apricots feel; creamy and thick overall; not bad a bit boozy defo a good beer. a plus imho. a sipper not a chugger. id put this in the catagory of desert beer it is like a hershey candybar melted in a peaty single malt scotch
963,Backwoods Bastard,4.67,on tap at the brewery 8 oz. poured into a snifter.  appearance: very dark brown slight off-white head that lingered long leaving even considerable lacing.  nose: alcohol dried fruit.  mouthfeel: medium thick adequate carbonation.  attack: very complex rich malt dark dried fruit followed by warming alcohol.  finish: just enough bitterness from the roasted malt to balance the attack.  overall: this ale well deserves its world-class rating. the only wee heavy i’ve enjoyed more was the old cincinnati-based quaff bros. collaboration wee honey.
964,Backwoods Bastard,4.6,bottled 9.22.16  poured at fridge temp into a tulip glass  head gushed out as i popped the top pours a light cola brown with light coming though on the ends and a 1f tan head that settled quickly but persisted down the glass. 4.5  scotch heat and warmth off the nose sweet malt and caramel. a delight for sure. 4.5  malty scotch oak and barrel lingering earthy hops. its a fantastic sipper and good cold or cellar temp. 4.75  warming but solid moderate body with just the right amount of bitterness and carbo. 4.5  overall the best wee heavy ive had to date and would love to try again. 4.5
965,Backwoods Bastard,3.84,caramely the high abv is perfect going down not too much but really adds.
966,Backwoods Bastard,4.45,im sorry i dont know how to review like everyone. all i know is i was having a sophies choice beer battle with myself and i a die-hard stout lover said overall probably backwoods. i was delighted to see it was ranked so high!
967,Backwoods Bastard,4.45,bottled 3 months ago (12/14/22) look: ruby red decent head recedes quickly lots of smoke opening the bottle smells amazing like toffee raisin marshmallow candied nuts and definitely scotch whiskey taste: really satisfying everything youd want from the nose whiskey a kind of mapley sweetness pecan smokiness vanilla just delicious had with some chorizo sausages (a good meal); 11% so be careful :) had this another night and picked up a lot of cherry maybe some chocolate. buttery and smooth mouthfeel pleasantly carbonated. that scotch taste is what does it for me in this beer need to try more of this style.
968,Christmas Ale,4.5,a bit sweet a bit spicy quite carbonated
969,Christmas Ale,4.65,2022 release poured into chilled whisky chalice at 55degf.  l: pours dark with a fine-bubbled tan head that dissipates within a minute or so  s: dark fruits malt caramel banana clove pear warmed s: caramel and booze notes come out in full force with fruit receding  t: surprising blood orange note mixed in with clove allspice caramel with boozy notes on the end reminiscent of cognac. continued partaking sees a buildup of barrel aged flavors. warmed t: sweet dates mix with the blood orange spices recede somewhat  f: medium/heavy mouthfeel that coats the tongue. definitely a sipper that can stand without a food pairing. satisfying to the palate on its own. the texture clings in a way that layers on flavors as you continue to sip enhancing what comes through as almost a barrel-aged taste although without the normal acridity you get from the tannins in barrel-aged beers. there is a light hopping that would cleanse the palate if drunk with food. warmed f: coats the palate less the longer you drink perhaps a buildup of the hops or a thinning as the beverage warms.  o: an excellent quad. not too sweet (thank god). i wouldn\t say it screams christmas but it is a spectacular trappist offering. so glad i managed to get my hands on this beer. feels stronger than 10% when you\re near the end of it.  it does make your breath smell christmas-y
970,Christmas Ale,3.77,poured from an 11.2 oz. can. has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of dark fruits light spices. taste is dark fruits alcohol malts light spices. feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer.
971,Christmas Ale,4.5,we should all look forward to the 2023 release because every one b4 has been killer. spiced quad baby!
972,Christmas Ale,4.38,classic christmas ale lots of flavoured aromas (that change with warmth…i liked the cherry that popped out of the glass right off the bat)…high abv so a real sipper…a perfect after dinner treat tho i got first taste before…paired with a piece of stolen bacon from the kitchen and a sunset on the back deck….perfect. the salt and the sweetness of the ale contrasted beautifully….highly recommended. this is why the old world old school breweries are still top of the line in this category.
973,Christmas Ale,3.53,clear copper-approaching-ruby-colored body with a creamy off-tan head; malty bready moderately sweet with some minor spices and earthy/herbal notes some dark fruit characteristics typical of belgian quads. smooth and sweet but really un-remarkable to me.
974,Darkness,4.58,2022 vintage:  poured from a 16 ounce can dated 9/28/22 into a snifter.  look- black opaque medium brown frothy head above average head retention and lacing.  smell- toasted oats cacao toffee medium strength of scent.  taste- coffee cacao cherry mildly sweet high strength of flavor.  feel- between medium and full body average carbonation moderately bitter mildly sweet moderately mouth coating moderately mouth warming.  overall- black with medium brown frothy head and above average head retention and lacing. bouquet was medium in strength and dominated by toasted oats with notes of cacao and toffee. taste was high in strength and a superbly balanced mix of coffee cacao and cherry. feel was between medium and full body with moderate mouth warming and moderate coating properties. overall the bouquet of this beer was more understated than expected but the rest of the attributes more than made up the difference providing an overall great drinking experience.
975,Darkness,4.33,a huge ris well appointed with robust fruit and chocolate an earthy and grass splash of hops and a long lingering alcohol warmth. the finish is clean and impressive for it. well done!
976,Darkness,4.12,traded for this ages ago probably from shogokawada thanks whoever it was! 2008 vintage. enjoyed on 3/3/23. poured from a 750ml waxed and capped bottled into a snifter. served lightly chilled.  impenetrable seal brown liquid with a lasting dun collar. fine lacing; thick viscous legs. surprisingly good retention.  molasses chocolate covered cherries medium-roast coffee maple candy and complex malt in the nose.  stale coffee milk chocolate weak tobacco and brown sugar on the palate. low bitterness faint grapefruit but the hops have faded. flavors are good but a bit flat though there are few other signs of oxidation. medium finish with malt balls loam and plum pudding.  medium-full bodied creamy with decent carbonation. abv is well integrated.  after 15 years this is surely past its prime but remains a brooding stately gentleman of an ale.
977,Darkness,4.06,2016 vintage served at 52 degrees.  while the color of this beer is like pretty much every other stout what stands out is the glorious thick and persistent dark tan colored head. beautiful looking consistency and excellent lacing. rare for me to think of a stout as anything above a 3.75 but this is getting a 4.5  nose isnt up to the same level as the look but its still really nice highlighted by loads of chocolate toffee and faint roast. taste largely follows but with much more roast & coffee. body is not quite as hefty as i anticipated. i want to say its light but it also feels like a milkshake and those two things dont seem to make sense together so im not sure how to describe it. regardless this is quite tasty. glad i finally cracked it open.
978,Darkness,4.54,(bomber black-waxed darkness 2020; purchased off shelf at shangys last week... poured into my trillium fat tulip)  l: tight creamy dark tan foam; dark brown liquid bordering on black opaque... head recedes into a splotchy cap and smeared collar but it laces lots in jagged fingery-flecked bands  s: mint and espresso overtones; bittersweet dark chocolate... slowly emerging hints of roasted grains alcohol irish cream qualities... a few beats later charred and deeply toasted caramelized grain... kind of an overall typical ris aroma profile; tonic outdoorsy top notes; perhaps short of cinematic in scope but nonetheless invigorating  t: big burst of bold flavors: espresso toffee molasses cookie... sweetish roasty residual underbelly and lightly campfiery roasted nutty overtones in the aftertaste; big burp after a minute brings up sweetish sooty dark chocolate... second big sip more of a rounded malt character with the interplay contrast and divide of heavy roast and rich crystal malts more stark; still little booziness but some delicate spicy phenols and dark dried fruit notes starting to surface and not long after some subtle black licorice... hop herbality finally opens up rising above the burnt bliss of sugars below  f: cooling quality to its aromatics... slick velvet texture... lithe levity despite its luscious lines... medium-full bodied bordering on the latter... malt milk attenuated and accentuated by the balance of booze; dark nog rib-sticking... maybe its the 2 years on this but its heaven to my senses  o: not the most nuanced but a pretty darn solid ris... its sweetness is a touch more redolent than most style examples but luckily the roasted barley and hop bitterness are as intense lending some needed balance... as expected its high marks are likely because of its relative unavailability; this was the first time (along with abrasive) that ive encountered it out this way so i was easily compelled to buy a bottle (2086)
979,Darkness,4.6,this beer is dark but not dark like used motor oil. smells of roasted coffee. this is one beer where you definitely have to let sit out for awhile to really taste it. has a strong malt taste and not boozy at all.
980,Darkness,4.34,2021 vintage  i’ve been sitting on this one for a minute now and i’m excited to finally try it. an absolute classic ris and one that totally caught me off guard when i saw it at the store just sitting on the shelf. this is also my first beer from surly so i’m even more hyped. let’s tackle this massive beast  pours a very dark brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  there’s still a solid bitterness to this for being 2 years old which is quite surprising to me. i’m picking up on aromas of leafy hops burnt caramel molasses dark chocolate charred wood dark roast coffee light vanilla and red grape  while still bitter in taste it feels like it’s integrated much better than the nose. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting red grape cocoa powder charred malt caramel vanilla bean black cherry sweetened coffee light earthy hops and toffee. the swallow brings notes of res grape black cherry molasses milk chocolate light roast coffee leafy hops vanilla bean sweet caramel and charred malt  a full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick and lightly boozy beer. finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time  oh yeah this is really good. warm and complex it develops over the course of the drink. i’ll have to try other vintages
981,Darkness,5,straight 5s. sublime is my word for 2023 and it applies here. labeled a ris this is not the traditional version. while high in abv and pitch black it is super creamy and loaded with underlying tones of dark dried fruit like prunes figs or dates and subtle hints of cocoa and coffee. i am not suggesting they are added but they are present in the flavor profile. this stout is truly remarkable and i am so happy it is available locally (pa) for the first time in forever.
982,Darkness,4.6,canned 10/19/22 enjoyed 1/9/23 poured pitch black very slowly as the tan head was quite aggressive. lots of lacing left as i sipped it down. the aroma even to my damaged nose was dark fruit and caramelized sugar and roasted malts. the taste was all that and more the flavor just kept coming. the front was the sweet part and the middle the savory with the swallow bringing in the hops to keep it from going all mushy. the feel was spot on a very nice sipper and just overall an excellent ris.
983,Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.14,2022
984,Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.56,750ml capped bottle into a bbt snifter. shared with schen9303.  pours pitch black and dense. no head no lace. thick oily sticky legs. nose is a boozy rocky road ice cream. notes of fudge chocolate vanilla and sweet cream. some hazelnut and brown sugar as well. pretty incredible how much it smells like the dessert. beer opens chocolate vanilla and sweet cream. hazelnut shell and ash. all the flavors are there but somehow this isnt too sweet. a touch of roasted malt and cocoa powder towards the end just to add a slight bitterness. barrel throughout that becomes more prominent as this one warms. this is delicious! body is medium with low carbonation. smooth and somehow soft on the palate. sticky and boozy going down with a long lingering aftertaste. im usually a fan of heavier bodies but somehow this works perfectly.  im a couple of years behind the hype here but these angry chair adjunct stouts have been incredible. the nose and flavors are perfect.
985,OB Lager Beer,2.36,a neighbor gave me one of these beers. good thing because lagers are not my style. just got back from a bike ride and figured it’d be a good time to try it. i will sum this review up by saying if it was any worse it would be flushed by now.
986,OB Lager Beer,1.1,when there is nothing else available while in the rok you drink ob or soju. think the bud for korea.
987,OB Lager Beer,4.1,loved this beer when i was stationed in korea. at 10¢ a 16oz glass (back in the early 70s) it was a great deal.
988,OB Lager Beer,2.25,a-pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing a-aroma has lemongrass hints t-the taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor m-a light bodied well carbonated beer o-a decent lager
989,Resin,4.38,this is crisp easy mouthfeel with smooth carbonation that feels right finishes clean and slightly dry. straight forward hop-character. the high abv is well masked and does not taste boozy. very drinkable and i will drink again.
990,Resin,4,hazy gold color; small white head. nose is slight initially with flowery and citrus notes. full-bodied. finish is bitter.
991,Resin,3.71,12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.50. pkg 22333 which means that this was packaged on 11/30/22. that would make this beer 2 1/2 months old.  look: its a beautiful copper color with a slight haze/particulate floaties in suspension appearance. nice beige-colored head that is sticking around.  smell: mild citrus notes with tons of spicy hop resin and pine. this is probably a bit too cold straight out of my beer fridge so the full bouquet is not coming out. some herbal/oniony notes on the finish. subtle watermelon and papaya notes and some honey thrown in.  taste: this is aggressively hopped but you wouldnt really know it from the nose. up front there is some caramel malt sweetness with subtle honey notes. then the hops take over and this is an intensely bitter ride to the finish line and beyond. the bitter finish lingers long and is full of hop resins and earthy woody pine along with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. all this being said this imperial ipa maintains a semblance of balance because there is a significant malt backbone to support the aggressive hop bill. as the hop bitterness on the finish eventually recedes some cool peppery watermelon notes are coming through giving this beer an oddly refreshing feeling.  feel: the body is medium plus with a slick oily mouthfeel.  overall: this is a really solid west-coast style double ipa. personally imperial ipas are not my favorite of styles but i can dig ones in this vein occasionally. for 9.1% abv its quite drinkable. i would like to try to re-review this beer if i can get my hands on a fresher version.
992,Resin,4.75,as one gets older variety in the house gives way to what you like in the house. living in ny has one perk in that you can get everything. this is my house beer. if you can get them fresh get them. its a mans beer. screw it if thats not kosher.
993,Resin,4.43,this is a big beer obviously. at 9.1% it does come across a little boozy which does effect the texture or feel of the beer a bit. that is to be expected with these bigger ipas though.. honestly one of my go-tos for a bit big fun citrusy juicy resinous all of the adjectives.
994,Resin,3.91,pours orange gold with off white persistent head and excellent lacing.  aromas of resin floral notes and soapy earth.  the flavors are mostly resin and earth with only a touch of bready malt and grapefruit. some booze and diesel on the back-end of the palate.  extremely lively and drying mouthfeel which helps make this one pretty drinkable.  epic levels of hop bitterness. a little simple and rough in that regard but i get what they were going for here. solid.
995,Harvest Ale,4.25,on tap mothership series #24. pretty good. its got a nice balance of hop carmel and honeydew melon. not super tasty bright vibrant honey dew melon. the more earthy not quite bursting with flavor melon flavor. subdued but in a way that works well for this beer. glad i got to try it.
996,Harvest Ale,4.35,pours amber with a 1.5 white head which lasts. moderate lacing.  aroma is floral citrus pine.  taste is orange papaya light grapefruit pine.  medium body moderate carbonation. dry resinous finish.  this is another outstanding ipa from founders.
997,Harvest Ale,4.47,l: pours a nice hazy orange color with a tall beige head with great retention. s: smells super fruity decent amount of citrus super piny nice malt backbone little bit of melon. t: follows the nose has a great balance between the biting hops & the sweet malt backbone! f: full-bodied moderate carbonation warming crisp biting slightly oily. o: really impressed by this brew! will definitely buy again.
998,Harvest Ale,4.19,this is nicely balanced and smooth but with a sharp hop bitterness that evens out well. excellent
999,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,4.62,cran-ber-rita has a thin fizzing-away pink head a semi-opaque magenta appearance bubbles and no glass lacing. the aroma is of cranberry cocktail and the flavor is the same with tartness and no bitterness. there is sweetness and perhaps pale malt. mouthfeel is high medium and cran-ber-rita finishes mainly dry.  rjt
1000,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,2.66,aroma is slightly artificial/funky cranberries and a good hint of sweetness. the flavor is similar to the arom with the artificial/funky cranberries being overpowering with a sweet finish.
1001,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,2.17,50 cent 8 oz can out of the bargain basket.  pours a cranberry jelly color with a diminished head that rivals the length of seeing a shooting star. 80% opaque.  aromas of margarita mix and lime salt a touch of ocean spray and 7 up.  quite strong on the alcoholic presence with a short-lived antiseptic-like throat spray flavor that fades to a more fruity light cranberry cocktail juice taste. the alcohol is felt almost immediately in the tummy and the carbonation stings the tongue. finish has the ripe bitterness of cranberries which may be the only thing genuine here. ugly dryness rivaling sore throat on the finish which actually walks in tandem with the throat spray flavor.  overall the cran-brr-rita is a nice attempt but falls short just as all the other beers in this line do. too much antiseptic only to be covered up by pure sugar and some artificial cranberry additive.  im giving it a 2 overall which actually feels somewhat generous.
1002,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,3.65,as most other reviewers are stating you almost can\t rate these rita products as beer. however if this was brought to me in a glass and i was told it was a cooler i would be fairly impressed. juicy somewhat artificial cranberry flavour. no detection of the 8% abv. i\ve made the mistake of having 4 of these in a night. the hangover was far and away worse than what it would have been if i\d consumed the equivalent amount of alcohol in good beer so be wary of drinking multiple. all in all this is a serviceable summer beverage.
1003,Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,3.32,first off i want to say i only like this drink because it doesnt taste like beer at all. more like juice or punch.  l:4 this drink looks good. not good as a beer but good as a drink. pink like cranberry juice with a small quickly receding head. s:3.75 again smells like juice. no alcohol hops malt or anything beer-like to be detected. smells very sweet with some slight bitterness from the cranberry. t: tastes exactly like juice or hawaiian punch. i cant taste anything resembling beer in this beverage. very slight alcohol taste. goes down fast! f:2.75 its carbonated like a beer but the feel of the juice seems too thick to go with it. kinda lingers in the mouth slightly syrupy and sticky. o:3 its not a bad drink but i dont think its really a beer at all despite the fact its a malt beverage. id drink it if i was in the mood and was offered but probably wouldnt ever seek it out. worth trying if you like juice or wine coolers.
1004,Old Style Light,2.54,poured from a cab into a plastic cup. pours golden straw yellow with a fluffy white head. smells of corn and cereal grain underwhelming. tastes of watery grain no hops of any sort. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall a below average beer.
1005,Old Style Light,3.26,l- just to as close to water as possible. lots of carbonation one-finger bubbly white head. s- sweet grain smell. t- suprisingly good. i will drink old style especially at wrigley. it does have some good grain and malt taste especially for a light. way better than bud coors and others. f- crisp light and refreshing like it is supposed to be. o- as good as macro gets. i will drink this pabst and moosehead.
1006,Old Style Light,4,old style light | pabst brewing company. poured from the can into a pint glass this brews head is two fingers thick with spotty lacing and a rather pale light golden clear body.  smells like corn with a touch of other full-bodied grains.  lighter on the corm/malt than others but still enjoyable nonetheless. at least it actually has a flavor to it.  the mouthfeel is medium-light with mild carbonation.  ill give old style light an overall rating with a solid 4. i could chill on these on a nice hot day.
1007,Old Style Light,4.18,old style light brewed by pabst brewing company with an abv of 3.80% this brew pours out a golden amber color with a small white head. there is a nice amount of carbonation to this light brew. there is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew it sticks to the side of the glass nice. the smell of old style light is rich with grains and malts. lots of corn and other malts in the smell. you pick up a hint of hops in the smell of this brew. this light brew has the look and smell of most light brews on the market not saying that is a bad thing. now for the taste light and crisp with grains and malts. for the style this brew is pretty decent. not the best but it is smooth. i like how smooth this brew goes down. there is nothing overpowering about this light brew old style light has an decent balance to it. the mouth feel of old style light is light crisp clean smoothand refreshing. overall im giving old style light a 4.25 out of 5. not a bad drinking brew it would go down good on a hot summer day. i would buy this brew again. pabst brewing company did a nice job with this light brew.
1008,Old Style Light,2.28,$1 cans during cubs games at the mill in iowa city. priced appropriately.
1009,Old Style Light,2.28,painfully average but heavier a light beer than i expected. i thoroughly enjoy old style despite a lot of the divided and often negative opinions it merits (my father cites it and miller high life as the two worst beers he has ever had) and this light alternative is almost the same in terms of matching how filling its brother beer is. other than that it brings a middling taste to the table but after miller 64 everything seems so exquisite in flavor.
1010,Old Style Light,3,left the night shift early to hit the casino with a coworker. he had a case of old style light in his backseat. we shotgunned a few of them in the parking lot each. i then walked in like i owned the place put $100 down on red and lost. after we each lost a little more money we laughed about the whole thing over some more old style lights and an illegal cigarette.  overall: old style light isnt weihenstephaner original but its now the traditional casino beer.
1011,Ann,4.95,fantastic
1012,Ann,4.84,2015 batch which i think is batch #3. bottle pour from hill farmstead brewery in greensboro vt.  this one pours a fairly clear golden orange color with a small head and a bit of lacing.  this smells like lemon peel tea honey grassy funk white wine pear skin melon riesling and a minerally funk.  this is my biggest white whale the beer i have most wanted to try since first trying hill farmstead originally 10 years ago. it’s tremendous just about as good as it gets for saison but it wasn’t even the best beer i had from hill farmstead on my recent trip. that’s how high the bar is for this long-time favorite brewery of mine. this has soft subtle and richly complex flavor to it. there’s the obvious honey almost like honey-soaked pears or something like that with white wine riesling grapes melon apricot jam and a floral and minerally funk. all of these flavor descriptions make it seem like it’s a super strong and intense beer – it really isn’t. it’s really delicate and rewards slower sipping and enjoying.  this is light bodied soft almost creamy with a wonderful drinkability. it’s well carbonated but in a subtle way.  this might not be the exact top of the mountain for hill farmstead – that’s probably samuel or one of the sara residency beers. but this is pretty close to the top and a perfect expression of an already great beer in anna.
1013,Ann,4.27,on tap at finleys pub in denver. very good for the style
1014,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4,8/16/23 pour is a murky brown/deep ruby. half finger of lightly khaki foam dissipates quickly to ring around the glass. nose is caramel toffee bourbon taste is bourbon citrus orange vanilla oak toffee caramel solid bitterness. definitely not overly sweet. will likely benefit from some extended aging. good beer.
1015,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.18,4pk
1016,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.36,at least 2.5 years old. great barleywine overall but the barrel is muted. not getting much more than the standard here.
1017,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.31,received in a trade with dim 3-8-23. consumed for review 3-9-23. 2023 edition.  beer poured dark brown with a very nice off-white head.  nose is very nice as the bourbon barrel forward extended aging is lending notes of vanilla along with citrus.  taste follows the nose as the malt base emits notes of figs and plums the barrel lends a touch of vanilla and the generous hopping lends some orange overtones. finishes nicely balanced between the bourbon and the citrus hops with some residual heat from the barrel.  mouthfeel is medium to large bodied very smooth and chewy.  overall a very nice beer that i am thankful for the opportunity to try! i am not a huge believer in aging beers given my mature palate but i suspect if this rested a year or so the flavors would integrate nicely!
1018,Barrel Aged Behemoth,3.56,another big ups to nick for breaking this out in the backyard may 2022.  pours dark brown. 1/4 beige head at its peak. lower carbonation possibly. the aroma was decent but revealed more of the clash to come. bittering hops bourbon oak vanilla maris. its all there and its not totally disjointed but doesn\t really hit that beatles like note of come together.  taste yeah see this just kind of tastes like an imperial of their barleywine. rather than the smoothness of a bourbon barrel you get amplified heat and bitterness. the 100ibu level of the base is just ramped up here. like i like american barleywines its my biggest complaint about bil and their english barleywine kink. but this beer is evidence for their claims not mine. i guess i just think one version is better barreled versus not barreled. the vanilla didnt pan out here. weird i preferred their adjunct barleywine to this. cant win em all. id still buy a 4 pack because i think these would be pretty good a decade from now. just not now as much.
1019,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.34,single bottle from jungle jims
1020,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.7,pours out dark brown with hardly a head on top. has a strong licorice raisin smell the barrel comes after it warms. tastes the same as it smells and gets stronger as it sits.
1021,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.08,meh
1022,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.19,2023 vintage into a small snifter.  a: murky dark brown with surprisingly lasting rim of head with a few blotches of lacing.  s: vanilla chocolate coconut rum raisin and dark and burnt caramel - malt and barrel aroma blasts left and right.  t: flavor heavy malty with raisin coconut dark caramel vanilla milk and dark chocolate and soft coffee in the finish. it is firmly bitter with a bit of spicy hop flavor in the aftertaste. alcohol character is obvious but not overbearing.  m: feel is very drinkable with medium body and a little of hefty syrup in the finish but high carbonation for the style which works.  o: very enjoyable fresh ba barleywine from 3f - big upgrade from the base level trim.
1023,Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.03,this is quite good actually not my absolute favorite of the style because in typical 3 floyds fashion this is more hoppy than other barleywines. so it has some bitterness to it as opposed to full on whiskey raisins. still pretty good
1024,Space Trace,5,08/11/23 bottle @ home
1025,Space Trace,4.55,even though there seems to be fluidity in the top 250 this will be my 75th on the list. definitely see why it is on the list. pours dark minimal head and lacing. strong scents of bourbon coconut and chocolate. this follows to the taste as it’s very sweet and boozy but the flavors blend well. big bodied just a hint of oiliness not thick or syrupy but assertive alcohol burn. really tasty.
1026,Space Trace,4.55,a - pours a motor oil black with a thin tan head. oily lacing.  s - aroma is coconut vanilla dark chocolate and bourbon.  t - the taste is dark chocolate coconut vanilla coffee and a nice amount of bourbon barrel.  m - full body with medium carbonation. chewy mouthfeel with a slick dry finish.  o - really well done. coconut is there but doesn’t overpower the flavor. good amount of barrel throughout.
1027,Space Trace,4.27,2018 version poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a snifter. i thought this would be sweeter but i think it is quite good with the cacao standing out more than the coconut. some booze heat to back it up.
1028,Space Trace,4.61,rating this from coming across 4 coconut beers - prairie pirate weekend is number one so far. this is batch 003. l: poured from a 500ml bottle into a snifter - jet black pour with 1 fingers length of dark malty foam risen to the surface. s: big fudgy chocolatey aromas of coconut cacao vanilla hazelnut even getting some lactose in this. can sense its very sweet. t: just as the aroma tells! brownie/milk chocolate cacao coconut hits first followed by some vanilla in the middle and a hazelnut ending. i love this one. this is my favorite bottle logic barrel aged to this day! f: heavy oily thick bodied easy to sip. hides abv very so well. o: this is hard to compare with prairie pirates weekend but man this takes the top spot. my new all time favorite coconut chocolate stout of all time. the reason is because the milk chocolate was there cacao was there coconut was there followed by the complexity and thickness of the beer. two separate beers but id be very curious to see if they aged this in rum barrels. this might change the whole stout game itself if that were to be the case.
1029,Space Trace,4.61,2023 batch! sweet milk chocolate creamy coconut and hint of vanilla bourbon barrel nose on this one! taste follows with a moist chocolate fudge brownie with some coconut-vanilla drizzle on it finish! ha! yum! the barrel is subtle here but it comes out more as it warms...a little more chocolate malty roastiness peeks out as well. this is a delicious coconut stout!
1030,Space Trace,4.4,brownish black pour with a fat finger of brown foam. starting with the taste has the lead of bourbon coconut chocolate and vanilla in that order of intensity. smell is more chocolate/coconut truffle like with more melding balance with the barrel but same elements. feel is malty and barrel forward smooth and warm oak toastiness is refined.
1031,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2.62,ended up in my beer cart by accident. expected the worst but was actually a wee . . bit surprised. essentially a tacky cheap slightly malty adjunct lager.. ok nothing special - a pabst+.
1032,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.56,very refreshing malt liquor. smooth malty bready nice gold color and cheap. not the best of the malt liquor family but definitely a drink i would recommend for my fellow malt liquor beginners.
1033,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,1.15,this is the most disgusting skunky garbage i have ever consumed. i thought olde english was bad but this is somehow even worse and i went in with low expectations. it tastes like someone drank too much beer and pissed into a can. the only thing it has going for it is the abv.  grab a 6 pack of carling ice before you reach for colt.
1034,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.26,pours a fine looking beer. actually raiting this based off the 40 oz i opened a few weeks back poured one pint of and twisted the cap back on. worth nothing its glass 40 oz. honestly i went to pour it out and heard a nice big hiss saw the beer do some fuckin science in the glass so i poured the thing in my glass. turned out to be a good move its a solid unpretentious american hellesbock. head stayed on like a miller beer would. tastes like a pabst extra. rated to style.
1035,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.3,this was a beer reminding me of my high school days and nights of drinking beers when we could get them. nice to see that it is still around. poured a golden color with a fairly thick white head and very bubbly. the smell was malt corn bread and hops. the taste was malt bread and hops.
1036,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.59,pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with a bite head. smell is corn malt wheat and hay. taste follows nose some citrus hops cracker meal malt grassy herbal note . mouth feel is not boozy has a sweetness to it could drink another for sure.
1037,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.17,from a 24oz can:  appearance: clear yellow-gold huge head.  smell: sweet corn some stale hay.  taste: sweet slight corn sweet fruitiness-slight pear note. medium to light body sweetness lingers somewhat in the finish.  overall: what better than some malt liquor over the 4th of july weekend? finally trying the legendary colt 45 as one of the local stores had it in 24oz cans. not too bad as with most in the style you want to drink it cold. no major flaws a solid malt liquor thats up there with oe800 and mickeys as good ones in the style.
1038,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.26,got a 24oz can best by august 1st poured into my warsteiner pils glass just for fun.  on the pour a 1ish finger head forms then becomes fizzy amd recedes to a ring around the glass amd light covering. crystal clear generic lager color a light straw gold with lively carbonation. looks like a decent cheap beer. and it almost wants to lace  the nose is surprisingly decent especially for the style. some slight green apple off notes right up front but not too far behind is an actual bready malt aroma that is present possibly even some cheap but detectable hops on the nose. there is a bit of oxidized notes but this is way better than olde english 800 for sure. as it warms the green apple flavor grows and becomes almost unpleasant but its really just a cheap lager note that i get a lot in aal beers a lot more than im getting in this one.  flavor follows the aroma bringing a bit of corniness along with the malts. the hops largely disappear leaving only a hint of bitterness right up front that mingles with a bit of the green apple then gives way to a largely pleasant and almost soft bready and corny malt/grain flavor. coming in with low expectations i was very pleasantly surprised.  feel is at first sip a bit watery with a quick finish and a big hit of carbonation bite but as you drink more it hits the stomach quite heavily making this quite filling which is a bit of a curve ball after everything else about this beer made me forget that technically this is a malt liquor. no complaints really however as this is the only spot that has even been close to reminding me what kind of beer im drinking.  overall ive had beers that where a whole lot worse than this. obviously ive had better but this is almost a decent american style lager. and at only 5.6% its really not all that big a beer by todays standards. the only thing really making this a malt liquor is that its been around since the only choices were bud miller and coors and its a bit stronger than those bmc beers. taste is actually surprisingly high quality for what it is.
1039,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2,use only in extreme emergencies if you are a poor high school kid. almost enough nostalgia to make me want to revisit in the current age and see what its all about. the keyword being almost haha. who knows?
1040,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2.39,24oz can  poured this out bc i\m a maniac big lenny style and it\s beautiful big lenny style. smells like corn hops and rot. taste is heavy on that spoiled garbage juice flavor that i guess some people are keen on... terrible even for the style but it gets ya drunk
1041,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.95,canned in a big old tallboy crafty craft can and purchased from the local minimart on petersfield avenue aroma is golden syrup flavour is slightly dry with some maple
1042,Crest Super Premium Lager,3.06,drinking this from a can cant comment on the look.  smell is pretty non-existant to my nose little bit of fruit/ lemon. not bad not great.  taste is syrupy and sweet with more lemon-y flavours and a bitterness that creeps up as you swallow. not really complex but not terrible. no sight of those finest german aromatic hops though more just bitterness without flavour. honestly i don\t hate it. could be more complex or backed up with hops but besides being a bit cloyingly sweet it really is not bad.  mouth feel is syrupy kind of thick because of the sweetness. not dry although there is bitterness which develops on the finish.  overall - i dont hate it like a lot of people on here. is it excellent highbrow beer? no. but for what it is it honestly isnt terrible. not too much liquor forward in my opinion tastes strong but not 10%. i would like some more hops and flavour besides the sweetness some orange or grapefruit would balance that... not great but not terrible. if you want a buzz for cheap go for it. and its better than the average american piss-in-a-can any day.
1043,Crest Super Premium Lager,4.33,love the nose on opening taste was quite what i expected. so many haters perhaps they are light beer drinkers. due to the high alcohol content i won\t be drinking it often however i will pick up the odd can in future. love a malt forward beer.
1044,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.02,some really horrid stuff but the drain drank most of it.
1045,Crest Super Premium Lager,1,the reviews of this beer are hilarious! i cant add much. crest super is pretty awful stuff! this is why its not a good idea to produce a high alcohol lager. eku-28 comes to mind. syrupy cloying flavors! and not good flavors! i have found that cutting this with half water makes it drinkable. i have this around in case i run out of ale that i brew. it gets things started quickly if you know what i mean. its basically a malt liquor for white people. attention commercial brewers: it is much easier and less expensive to brew a high alcohol ale that tastes great than to attempt the same with a lager. why are you not pursuing this? there is a market for a wonderful high alcohol ale...in a can!!! do it!!! still i would probably keep this around for emergencies. just add water for drinkability.
1046,Crest Super Premium Lager,4.66,my favourite beer.
1047,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.27,500ml can a sort of surprise new offering from the wells & youngs group to suddenly show up here in alberta (for the second time it would appear!). the ‘finest german aroma hops’ eh? wtf? was this actually made in the country that originated the english language?  this beer pours a clear bright medium golden amber colour with two chubby fingers of puffy rocky and bubbly eggshell white head which leaves some splendid bonsai tree forest lace around the glass as it quickly abates.  it smells of sickly sweet apples and pears gritty caramel malt yeasty rising bread lemon furniture polish and some strangely stanky um strange (ok hops i suppose but man are they musky). the taste is gritty and grainy caramel well ‘flavouring’ dead yeast cells pome fruit-heavy yuk-a-flux further near gag-inducing industrial alcohol warming notes and a distinct lack of the finest of german hops never to be seen in a shit show like this.  the bubbles are quite underwhelming in their barely perceptible frothiness the body a so-so middleweight as if buoyed by some unfamiliar sugar source and not really all that smooth not with that pithy cheap-ass booziness loafing about. it finishes still pretty sweet but all tainted here and musty and dead-seeming there. gah.  yeah this is not a craft brew by any stretch of the imagination which is a bit of a shame given the predilections of the parent brewing concern (courage bombardier etc) but it is a party-starter (or ender depending on ones constitution i presume) - euro malt liquor swill incarnate. oh and i have to apologize for my opening generalizing tirade about the english - we have shitty supposedly educated marketing people over here too.
1048,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.05,well its fairly rank stuff. but lets be honest. you buy this to get a buzz on the cheap. ive been there and i will say you could do worse. alcohol is omnipresent in this one yet it remains drinkable. not really worth further elaboration but if your buying this and expecting exceptional taste aroma or profiles your doing it wrong :d
1049,Crest Super Premium Lager,1.98,500 ml can picked up at tbs; best before june 19 2016 and served ice cold. this is a beer that i have intentionally avoided for nearly 10 years now but i was feeling masochistic tonight.  pours a clear golden colour capped off with one inch of frothy white head. it seeps away steadily over the next five minutes or so eventually thinning out into a foamy cap and collar. good lacing too - visually this is a rather attractive lager but aromatically i\d have to argue otherwise. corn syrup alcohol wet cardboard boiled vegetables and apples all come to mind but quality lager most certainly does not. to quote a certain fictitious news anchor i immediately regret this decision.  not quite as awful as id anticipated but still one of the worst beers ive had in years. very saccharine with flavours of corn syrup and cotton candy dominating at first. this is surprisingly enough countered by some weedy grassy hop extract bitterness but the truly off-putting aftertaste totally blots out that faint beam of light. little effort has gone into masking the alcohol content which is noticeable throughout the sip - but it really reaches its climax after you swallow a gulp. at that point this beer begins to taste the way that compost water and paint thinner smell. light-medium in body with appropriately assertive carbonation levels. the alcohol burn is so significant that it almost seems to have a numbing effect on the tongue.  final grade: 1.98 a miserable f. crest super premium lager is more of a fraternity hazing supply or a solvent than a beer. in fact it is easily one of the worst alcoholic beverages that i can recall consuming over the past decade - and consume i did all the way to the bottom of the can because im just that stubborn. crest is shamelessly boozy and i would judge no man or woman for pouring this swill down the drain. if you are drinking this simply to get drunk (and really why else would you be?) prove that you have more self respect than me and buy yourself a mickey of whiskey or rum or something.
1050,Crest Super Premium Lager,1,tastes like ass.
1051,Crest Super Premium Lager,1.22,easily the worst beer ive ever had.
1052,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.7,theres actually a bit of hop flavour here but mostly boozy corn.
1053,Crest Super Premium Lager,3.02,non drinkin bud light morons rate this beer low- so be it. ya want a kick! drink this beer! nasty by itself yes but i cut it 1/3 by 2/3 with another 5% lager have 4 or 5? your in buzztown baby....i dont drink vodka anymore :-) ya want a kick it up a notch! this beer is the way to go :-) screw the foo-foo beer puritans! as william wallace stated... freedom!!!
1054,Faxe Extra Strong,3.11,500 ml can from the lcbo; dated may 23 2022 and best before aug 21 2023; served well chilled. this is review #3000 so i had no choice but to go with the biggest doozie i could find.  pours a clear honey gold colour crowned with nearly two fingers of frothy foamy white head that dissipates within three minutes or so. a snaking band of delicate lace is left behind in addition to a soapy collar surrounding some filmy wisps on the surface - looks safe enough. it smells of alcohol corn syrup green apple skin and barley malts with faint hints of acetone banana chips and pears. not great but not entirely objectionable.  i gotta say i am a little impressed at how tolerable this is. corn husk honey sweetness and lots of grainy barley malt as well as a relatively low-key booziness that is ever-present throughout the sip. fruity hints of apple and white grape crop up briefly but dont last; the finish is corny-sweet and boozy with grassy dirty hops echoing into a malty boozy aftertaste. mostly lacking the fusel nastiness you get with really bad examples of this style but it does numb the tongue a little. medium-light in body with low carbonation and a light airy texture juxtapositioned with a slick clingy mouthfeel. im not 20 anymore but if i were thisd make a good pre-drink before hitting the bar or club or whatever.  final grade: 3.11 a passable c+. every thousandth review i pick out a dud - i.e. an arguably crummy beer that i have avoided reviewing previously. im not going to pretend that finishing this can of faxe extra strong wasnt a chore but truthfully this is not even close to the worst strong euro lager ive stumbled across. i think its one of the better ones - id easily take this over any of those bavaria 8.6 beers and it blows all of the other 10% euro lagers ive tried out of the water. realistically i have no excuse to ever drink this again and their fest bock is a much better beer... but extra strong still earns my tacit grudging approval plus a recommendation as a respectable example of its style.
1055,Faxe Extra Strong,3,poured a 500ml can into a pint glass. a one finger bubbly white head on a clear pale amber. good head retention and lacing. light malt smells. corn. very mild hop finish. moderate body and carbonation. better than i expected
1056,Faxe Extra Strong,3.87,(1 liter can 07apr20; purchased cold single 2 days ago from beer world liberty ny sipped on soon after over the course of 2 mobile hours pouring little by little into my new genesee 9 oz tasting glass... review cobbled from recollections of that journey)  10% quality lager beer; black can red/gold/white branding (different label than whats pictured here)... slightly hazy (decomposing) amber liquid; ample foam build with each pour and it actually collared and laced a bit... on the nose: fusel-kissed medicinal spice barmy yeast artificial fruit aroma undertones... on the palate: wells banana bread beer nuttiness enhanced dried out and fortified/tainted with cheap rotgut ethanol... textures: brief round swell up front dropping clean in the finish aside from a mild oily warmth but no burn; delicate tickle from the aforementioned spice/nut elements; mild effervescence  summary: almost 12 years to the day i finally found another beer with a nearly identical flavor profile to that of the carlsberg special brew i had at the prince of wales pub in aberdeen scotland; blown away: memories reminiscence flashbacks flooded my mind... that said this isnt a spectacular swill (but id love to try a fresh can) though its remarkably drinkable because dang i did end up finishing the whole can somehow (pacing?) and experienced no recoil from beginning to end... i guess it was worth the detour (1800)
1057,Faxe Extra Strong,4.2,faux 10% ultra strong beer or as me and my compatriate have affectionately renamed it: beans. the stylish can reimagines the can as a can of beans and leans more to the experience as the physical attributes of the beer itself. beans can turn your bad evening into a great one very quick although the taste leaves some to be desired this can be fixed by drinking beans out of the can which adds to the feeling that beans can give you which is rarely a tactic i have seen from my fellow beans drinkers. i urge everyone to forget about the taste of beans and to focus on how your day brightens after consumption. beans can change your life give beans the respect it deserves.  yours truly the beans brothers.
1058,Faxe Extra Strong,2.06,cloudy golden with a huge white head with decent lacing. this was the highlight of the beer. aromas of nail polish remover super sweet fruits especially pear and lemon and boozy grains. taste is so so so sweet like wow with booze to clash and amplify esters are too nuanced to describe the sweet fruit with some metal on the backend a complete mess. feel is boozy resinous sickly sweet and sticky almost gummy. not worth your time
1059,Faxe Extra Strong,2.02,i just hope denmark has anything better to offer. this is just 10% alcohol good for getting drunk quick and easy. but if you want to taste a good lager look somewhere else.
1060,Faxe Extra Strong,2.85,also known as faxe 10%. shared 1 liter can from vinmonopolet nettbutikken. pale golden colour moderate white head. moderate sweetish aroma slightly fruity a hint of hops - better than feared. very sweet flavour warming mouthfeel some hops in the finish. could have been worse.
1061,Faxe Extra Strong,3,canned in a behemoth of a full litre can and served as per steve from beer nouveau’s instructions for spesh pours a crystal clear golden body with decent enough white head aroma is pear drops some of that pear drop flavour is there not as bad as i thought it would be
1062,Faxe Extra Strong,2.61,tastes like ass but gets the job done.
1063,Faxe Extra Strong,2.73,look: crystal clear gold. one finger of fizzy white head with poor retention.  smell: sweet adjunct malt with a slight skunk and yeast note.  taste: sweet malt with an acidic slightly bitter metallic taste.  mouthfeel: full creamy body with high carbonation.  overall: pretty bad guys.
1064,Faxe Extra Strong,1.92,this is...whew! that one word could pretty much sum up the whole experience. i used to praise euro strong lagers for doing what american malt liquor brands never could but this. i dont know what they were thinking with this. the smell is akin to the most alcohol-forward malt liquors chemical. the taste retains that cleanliness found in euro strong lagers compared to their american cousins but it is just too much alcohol. i cannot stress this enough. it goes down hot. they were nice enough to add in a seemingly random helping of hops and a touch of sweetness but none of the rough attempts at balancing ive had in british offerings of the same style. this is just random ingredients mixed together with maximum alcohol being the only attempt. making this is itself absurd importing it to the united states where i am attempting to enjoy it now is just another level. why?
1065,Faxe Extra Strong,2.71,this will knock you back on smell alone. it has a deepness to it. it does loose its luster as you go because of how strong it is.  taste rating in words: its putting a ladder on scaffolding on a picnic table in a truck bed. just why?
1066,Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.64,enjoyed this in brussels. love raspberry and the lambic balance was excellent. the beer is relatively acidic to the mouth so be prepared. love this as a desert .
1067,Lou Pepe - Framboise,3.5,750 ml corked and capped bottle courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 5%. made with 300 g of raspberries per liter beer. clear signal red colour moderate pink head. intense aroma of raspberries (no surprise). the flavour is very sour with notes of lemons and raspberries fairly dry and crisp.
1068,IPA,4.19,poured out of a 12 oz. can into one of my pint glasses this beer pours a clear medium to dark golden color. has a white head thats about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to very thick layer of surface foam a thick ring lining the inside of the glass and excellent lacing. aromas of some bready malts w/ a bit of caramel along w/ piney floral and citrus hop notes. flavors of the aforementioned bready slightly zest malts w/ a nice bit of caramel sweetness gives way to the also aforementioned piney floral and citrus hop that provide the perfect amount of bitterness while there is a good amount of malts the hope certainly dominate the flavor profile here. which is as it should be. has a has a crisp slightly oily smooth medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. has a clean finish and a nice after taste. easy to drink in the good way a well crafted ipa ought to be.  eric
1069,IPA,4.29,brewers notes: true to form and always consistent ipa sets the standard for the india pale ale category with an impeccable blend of hops from the pacific northwest. ipa pours with a lofty white head and light copper hue with aromas of freshly-peeled orange grapefruit and soft tropical notes.  can received in bif17 from @ovaltine  poured into a pretentious beer glass  clear golden liquid craggy two finger white foam cap good retention good lacings  aroma is piney  citrus orange. mrs windrrllama claims to smell onions . i have never found that in a beer and applaud her recognition of that scentv  taste is pine citrus orange  smooth not bitter clean  crisp  hop kiss on the finish  good beer
1070,IPA,4.31,wonderful golden colour with a head retention of a few seconds. the aroma is dank piney and insanely inviting. very dry overall but not in an imbalanced way with the lingering bitterness asking you to have another sip. medium body. a delicious ipa that would be an excellent accompaniment to food. thank you @jzeilinger
1071,IPA,3.82,poured from the can into a spiegelau ipa glass. canned august 2nd 2022. pushing it here for freshness but at least it was in the cold case.  beautiful looking ipa. deep amber bodied with crystal copper colors and light appearances of carbonation. off white head definitely near the khaki yellow colored realm with simple classic three to four finger height. lots of staying power barely budging at all with massive retention. just a great looking bold ipa.  unfortunately hints of classic faded hops on the nose with a soft caramel dominating and leafy touches of herbs if a bit small on the nose. still theres a nice floral pungency here if understated.  palate seems fairly old school. touches of leafy sage like herbal hops with a big emphasis on tea green flavors. finish with soft caramel and more leafy like tea flavors and mild senses of bitterness. mild touches of pine and earth in the finish.  decent but i think i might have missed the boat on this one. this definitely needs a revisit from me in the fresh future cause there is some quality in here.
1072,IPA,4.49,a really good ipa super hoppy nice bitterness a bit of a mango flavor to it.
1073,IPA,4.41,its a good ipa. everyone in here poops their pants over an ipa. lol. beer snobs need their own place.
1074,IPA,4.1,12oz can canned 4/12/22 into a pint glass. l: pours light yeast hazed medium caramel colored w/fair carbonation a thick rocky 3/4 off white head w/good retention random light sticky lacing. s: lightly dank grassy oily caramelized malts hard candy. t: tangerine citrus zest a hint of berries light honey slightly earthy and grassy esp in the finish well balanced sweetness/bitterness hop forward and a bit dank. f: bright crisp medium bodied fluffy mouthfeel w/a pale medium length softly drying finish. it is lightly gritty. o: a well grounded earthy and simple american ipa. slightly dank in aroma & taste. 3 out of 10 on the dank-o-meter. fairly easy drinking and very good in its style.
1075,IPA,3.83,ipa from columbus brewing. received from @ovaltine in a nbs bif #15 ninja strike. stored at 40 degrees after receiving. reviewed 05/06/22. note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. bottom of can stamped “03/22/22”. served at 40 degrees in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. final temperature 46.5 degrees. appearance – 3.75 first pour – pale gold (srm 4) clear. body – gold (srm 5) clear. when rear-lite same. head – average (maximum 4.3 cm aggressive center pour) floral white high density average retention diminishing to an irregular 0.6 to 1.1 cm crown and a thin rocky cap. lacing – excellent! wide band tiny to small bubbles sticks to the side of the glass. aroma – 3.75 – floral hops predominate over grapefruit and possibly a hint of pine. no yeast no malt. flavor – 4 – bitter with a piney-grapefruit flavor. no malt. no yeast. no ethanol (5.3 % abv as marked on label) taste or aroma. mild gastric warming occurs. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. ends dry. palate – 3.5 – medium watery lively carbonation. final impression and summation: 3.75 darn good ipa! thanks mike!
1076,IPA,4.33,2022-05-08 12oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. dated 03/22/22. received from @ovaltine in shenanigans associated with nbs bif #14.  pours clear coppery amber with a big head and a little bit of visible carbonation. smell is classic west coast grapefruit rind and cut vegetation maybe a little honeysuckle thrown in there for good measure.  taste is very similar though with more of an emphasis on that honeysuckle and a bit of a bite in the resinous bitterness. very bright very clean. reminds me of fresh hops a lot.  mouthfeel is light and clean. this is a really good beer.
1077,420 Extra Pale Ale,5,mmmmmmm yummy beer. make me silly hehehe
1078,420 Extra Pale Ale,4.75,its about a perfect pale ale as you can get. the beer has a spot between sierra nevada and an ipa. more flavor than sierra but not as robust as a standard ipa. at 5.7% it is perfect for summertime drinking. pale ale are my favorite beers. if youre a pale ale fan then take it from me this is good.
1079,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.53,slightly more hoppy than other pales ales i have tried.
1080,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.91,a very nice pale ale similar to sierra nevada but a bit less bitter in the finish. it would be even better if it was infused with ganja!
1081,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.81,poured from a 12 ox can into a willi becher pint glass. l - pours a clear medium amber color with a significant whit head that dissipates slowly. s - smells of pine and grapefruit. t - taste matches the smell pine citrus and some maltyness. f - medium body & carbonation. o - easy drinking pale ale.
1082,420 Extra Pale Ale,2.85,its pretty watery. sweetwater just like the name. faint aroma of hops. grassy pale look. if budwesiser produced pa it would taste like this one.
1083,420 Extra Pale Ale,4.06,16 ounce draft pour into a tumbler pint glass.  l: orangish-yellow a touch cloudy small white head (probably subdued by the server) fades to a ring in less than a minute s: bright hoppy aroma mostly citrus almost juicy. t: hoppy subtle orange flavor pine comes through later in the glass enough malt to balance the clean zesty bitterness. f: crisp feel gives an overall light impression but does have a bit of heft not thin or weak. o: quality apa more american traditional but has some limited juicy character haven’t had this out of a bottle or can but this draft pour is pretty good.
1084,420 Extra Pale Ale,4,on draft at dulles airport no surprise it’s much better than from the bottle…think i’ll have another.
1085,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.61,it is what it is. a solid not spectacular pale ale. great for pool days summer activities or tailgating. crisp refreshing not mind blowing but good.
1086,Pumking - Caramel,3.56,i was excited to try this pumpkin ale and had heard it was great. to be honest everything was fine with the pour and the nose but the taste was straight up cream soda to me. not that i dislike cream soda but i just couldnt get past it. a decent beer but i didnt get a lot of pumpkin etc. an average one to me. i much prefer the original pumking.
1087,Pumking - Caramel,4.21,great new pumpkin beer added to the southern tier fall lineup. good caramel flavor and not over the top pumpkin.
1088,Pumking - Caramel,3.79,tis the season for pumpkin beers. this one is not bad. poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass this beer features a beautiful clear light copper color and a small foamy white head with somewhat better than average retention. light lacing on the glass. taste is malty with a nice blend of caramel and pumpkin/pumpkin spices. dont know if the pumpkin spices could have made this beer artificial tasting because the caramel adds a good bit of sweetness and flavor mouthfeel is rich and malty...a slow sipper. there is no alcohol harshness. the sweetness is not overdone. not just another dessert beer i had it with a pork chop dinner and it went really well.
1089,Pumking - Caramel,3.89,so sweet it has to be a slow drink.
1090,Pumking - Caramel,4,pours a clear orange. thin foam. caramel aroma. caramel and pumpkin spice body. spicy bitter finish. pretty sweet. not my favorite in the series but its still pretty good.
1091,Pumking - Caramel,3.62,clear nearly transparent dark amber body. good head production and retention.  aroma is a bit musty implying a heavy hand of the dry spices. caramel isnt particularly noticeable but it may be hiding along with the malt base. otherwise this smells like a fairly classic pumpkin ale - which pumpking is. it smells quite good but it also portends too much dry spice which can easily overwhelm a beer.  the hefty 8.6% base helps fend off that dry spice on the palate but its still more of a player than id prefer. theres a hint of the artificiality of regular pumking that i detest but its honestly not quite as bad - but also not as solid as warlock. at the same time the caramel doesnt quite add enough; its there when you know to look for it but otherwise could easily be overlooked. the pie crust is a lovely addition honestly as it adds a slightly sweet and grainy flavor to the malt base in complementary fashion.  overall this isnt bad and it fits the season. its an improvement over regular pumking but its not going to be a pumpkin ale i happily reach for either - on the rare occasion im in such a mood at all.
1092,Pumking - Caramel,4.4,ok just for clarity this isnt caramel pumpkin although caramel appears in bold capital letters above pumpkin imperial pumpkin ale on the label. the label even suggests rule on caramel. none of the semantics matters after two twelve ounce brown bottles are emptied into a clear glass liter mug. theres very little head. the brew is a bright and relatively clear copper-amber. the aroma brings modest pumpkin pie spices with an additional sweetness. this is a wonderful extension of the imperial pumpkin mainstay from this brewery. pumpkin and warlock are pumpkin brews without reproach. add this one to that list. the caramel inclusion is very tastefully done. it doesnt overly sweeter the brew it only adds a minor taste that makes a major enjoyment. adding just a little caramel sweetness and body does nothing to shortchange the original pumpkin ale. everything true to the original remains in tact here like taste body and mouthfeel. thats a good thing because this brewery has few rivals when it comes to imperial pumpkin ales. this is a pleasant although not drastic variation on a very successful brew.
1093,Pumking - Caramel,4.12,best by date: 7-17-25  a - dark medium golden orange color with perfect clarity vibrant steady carbonation and a thick creamy white layer of foam across the entire top looks great!  s - caramel and pumpkin spice dominate the nose.  t - pumpkin cinnamon nutmeg and caramel while ending with a pleasing moderate bitterness. a little bit of alcohol pokes through but doesnt deter from the overall flavor.  m - big silky smooth body that rounds the prickly carbonation off.  o - i like this better than this years batch of regular pumking. usually prefer the original over the variants but this one works.
1094,Pumking - Caramel,3.29,bottleneck says best by 7/17/25. huh. i suppose its safe to assume this was bottled on the same day this year. whatever.  pours a golden copper with a solid finger of head which thins to a ring with a modicum of lacing. smells pretty strongly not necessarily of caramel but like toffee hard candies. i get a bit of baking spice as well. but yeah mostly just overwhelming candy sweetness. a dessert beer for sure. taste brings a good deal of vanilla to the party. i suppose its there on the nose too just buried a bit. butterscotch liquor. not as sweet as feared; finishes on the dry side in fact. good pie crust-style malt base (the beers strong point imo). a little boozy. medium-to-full bodied. kind of a weird one but that might be owing to the fact that im drinking it in late summer. its definitely not a summer beer even if it is on the cooler side today. i think im going to sit on a couple of these. this feels like it would be a good post-thanksgiving dinner beer. fuck you seasonal creep!
1095,Pumking - Caramel,3.59,september 2023. hartwell. the original is much much better do not really have the pumpkin spice caramels a little sweet and overpowering. i would not buy this again.
1096,Oktoberfest,3.26,not too shabby. kind of thin like a cheap solid state amplifier! i would get it again if there is nothing else appealing in the cooler.
1097,Oktoberfest,3.33,dark amber/copper appearance. lots of carbonation. off white head that faded within a minute. muted malt/ sweet aroma. taste followed the aroma not much depth albeit highly drinkable. there are better marzens out there but this is okay given its lower price.
1098,Oktoberfest,5,i really like this beer. i’m not even a beer drinker. i bought it for my mom as she is a yuengling drinker. i was shockingly surprised at how much i liked it. even mom loves it better than her standard yuengling. flavor is smooth not bitter. really nice texture and body. highly recommend****
1099,Oktoberfest,3.5,tasted like their traditional lager with a drop of samuel adams octoberfest added to each bottle and a 6pk is about the same price as one of yuenglings 12pks. not the marzen you should settle for.  style: marzen | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 5.4% | rating: 3.5
1100,Oktoberfest,3.72,poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass.  dark amber in color what you would expect from an oktoberfest offering. very little head maybe 1/8 of an inch which dissipates quickly no lacing. (look 3.75)  understated notes of bread malt and caramel go well together but do not stand out. (smell 3.5)  refreshing but fairly light for a seasonal offering of this kind. a bit sweet and lacking in spice of other oktoberfests. (taste 3.75)  very light in the beginning but starts to stick around longer after about 1/4 of the way through. highly drinkable even if it is a bit on the lighter side (feel 4.00)  overall a pretty good oktoberfest offering. could easily have a few of these in one sitting. but it falls short of its closest highly available competitor the more flavorful sam adams. (overall 3.5)
1101,Oktoberfest,4.75,this is as close to a traditional german oktoberfest beer as it gets without being in a german pub. the only way it could be any better is if was served on-tap. or in a fest beer tent in germany. ive had yuengling lager von fass at the brewery many years ago. i was impressed then but wasnt with their bottled lager as brewed by miller. the black & tan was an improvement. but this oktoberfest really hit the mark! this is the brew to serve at the oktoberfest in fredrickburg! now im looking foward to trying their porter.
1102,Oktoberfest,3.4,it’s alright prefer sam adams by a long shot. good for gatherings for the price.
1103,Oktoberfest,3.45,12 oz bottle into a becher glass. l: pours true clear amber caramel with a light and fizzy off white head that has zero retention steady carbo bubbles no lacing. s: caramel malts faint apple a hint of brown bread light raisin notes. t: taste follows aroma to the t adding background dark fruits very little aftertaste and sensing lightly sweet & zesty citrus and malt. f: brisk light & dry. interestingly dry. o: very crushable and good tasting overall. i enjoying it on a hot & steamy august day and it stays lively. if you like lighter bodied beers this could be your friend. it is good in its style.
1104,Oktoberfest,2.64,i really like yuengling traditional so was excited to try this marzen style. a little disappointed in the flavor. i love oktoberfest beers but this one is not a fav of mine. not as malty and light on pronounced flavor.
1105,Oktoberfest,4.42,i get excited when i see the oktoberfest beers in the stores. it means football season is close. so far shiner was first in stores here in sotex. drank my fair share. walked i to heb and what did i see? yuengling oktoberfest....hell yeah!!  havent had it yet. yuengling hasnt been sold in texas for too long. damn i love this. its one of the easiest drinking oktoberfest beers. smells great tastes great. no beer snob review. just a dumb good beer. good work yuengling.
1106,Oktoberfest,3.69,picked up a 6 pack of bottles out of the beer cave at oncue on broadway in edmond ok (oncue is a clone of the beloved tulsa-based c-store called quiktrip). it was not stocked. had to open a case to get to it. fortunately it was already entered into the pos system and they could ring it up.  appearance: clear copper-amber with frothy buff head that lasts.  aroma: marzen... without the umlaut. smells more american. toasty bready malts with hints of caramel and nuts light floral/grassy hops.  flavor: clean and crisp not overly sweet and with a decent noble hop balance. still does not have the nuance of a german version.  mouthfeel: light to medium. feels a lot like other yuenglings.  overall: a respectable american o-fest. not complicated and has familiar and welcome characteristics.  p.s.; i contrasted this with their flagship traditional lager and this tastes more nuanced and cleaner. id rather the traditional lager tasted like this  but unfortunately an all-malt märzen costs more to make.
1107,Oktoberfest,3.4,poured from a bottle. a deeper amber in color with a small head. smells of malt dark caramel and dark fruit. starts with a dark caramel flavor that lightens into a malty nutty flavor. decent marzen
1108,Oktoberfest,3.38,poured from a bottle into a dfh shaped pint glass  the beer pours a clear copper color with a fluffy beige/khaki head that dissipated quickly leaving behind very little acing  the aroma is typical of the american versions of this style; mostly sweet with some bready malts and crackers. there is also a generic hoppyness.  the flavor has a caramel sweetness with notes of crackers and dark bread there is also a hint of spicy hops. light bodied and moderately carbonated.  overall this is a dumbed down version of the style quite drinkable but not terribly interesting
1109,Oktoberfest,4.69,looks like a typical oktoberfest beer smell was of biscuits and flowers just lovely. taste was smooth and creamy just the right amount of sweetness. mouthfeel was a little sticky. overall a great choice i have tried a lot of oktoberfest beers and this is one of the better ones. definitely worth a try.
1110,Oktoberfest,3.48,12oz bottle. poured out a clear golden amber color with a small off-white head of foam. it left minimal lacing on the glass. it smelled of caramel toffee and floral notes. sweet caramel and bready malt backbone with a mild bitterness.
1111,Hopora,4.38,nice head retention very smooth and juicy with no off flavors detected. a very decent light abv neipa with a lot of flavor and body to it. very nice job troegs.
1112,Hopora,4.34,opaque hazy yellow big white head excellent retention thin rings of lace lots of mango and sweet citrus aroma just a touch of dank and pine tastes like it smells plus a raw wheat flavor medium bodied fluffy and mouthfilling appropriate carbonation i dont really like most neipas but this one checks the boxes for the style
1113,Hopora,4.18,pours a cloudy wheaty yellow with a white head with some staying power. the smell is of grapefruit and other citrus with pine and grain in the background. the taste follows the aroma with a hint of oats. you can identify the oats in the mouth feel also. overall a good solid neipa.
1114,Hopora,3.95,a: hazy; medium gold in color; 1 finger white head that receded to a wispy cap with a moderate tight collar; nice lacing;  s: grapefruit with a bit of pine;  t: mango and orange from start to finish; a bit of lemon early and a touch of grapefruit at the end; mild to moderate bitterness on the finish;  m: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish; no hop burn;  o: very nice;
1115,Hopora,4.14,8/25/23 at the brewery again.
1116,Hopora,3.92,pours a light lemony straw color with a half finger of head. the nose has tropical fruity notes but also some earthy qualities. compared to the nose the flavor falls flat - light fruit and light bitterness.
1117,Orval Trappist Ale,4.6,bottled 07/09/2022 best by 07/09/2027. it poured a snifter full of cloud-white foam but gave off a spice aroma as i practiced that virtue called patience. as the foam went down and i could finally pour at least to the second pour line the scent was tart sour. the taste was subtle with finessed flavors: a sweetness back notes of pepper. and hops! all in a light mouthfeel. the aftertaste was of ground cinnamon.
1118,Orval Trappist Ale,4.43,it appears that this may be the highest rated brew of its style on beer advocate ... the rating is well deserved as this is quite delicious .... ill have to look back at other beers ive reviewed of the style to compare ... im admittedly not blown away but darn it is good
1119,Orval Trappist Ale,4.03,smell is frankly almost nonexistent -- not very aromatic. some malt honey florals. the body however is extremely tangy almost like drinking a sparkling water with a closely following body of heavy spice florals and honey. its lightning in a bottle followed by ambrosia. very unique very delicious.
1120,Orval Trappist Ale,4.23,11.2 oz bottle poured into an appropriate glass. bottled on 7/7/2022 and consumed on 7/16/2023 so this has a year on it. unknown aging conditions (it was a recent find at a store). started fridge temperature and slowly warmed to room temperature while drinking.  look: incredible head! the beer is a hazy golden color with one of the thickest off-white heads i’ve ever seen. pouring this thing is a risky adventure with overflow a real possibility! the head sticks around for a long time with tiny bubbles rising through the beer to keep it going long after you’d expect it to fade. minor-to-moderate lacing.  smell: exceptionally unique so much so that it’s hard to find appropriate words. there is a definite medicinal aroma but oddly it’s not off-putting. a dry fruity character is present somewhat (but not exactly) reminiscent of cider. a bit of lemon zest. there’s more but appropriate words are not coming to me. many reviews mention band-aids in the aroma and while i understand where they are coming from i don’t think this is quite an accurate description of the brett funk in this beer.  taste: so very dry! as this first hits my mouth the dry medicinal quality is very up-front. peppery spice (without heat) is also noticeable. the cider-like aroma shows up in the taste as well although there’s none of the fruity sweetness you find in a cider. there’s a bitterness that reminds me of citrus fruit rinds. the brett funk is present in a way that may or may not be enjoyable (i change my mind on every sip!) but is hard to otherwise describe with mere words.  feel: exceptionally well-carbonated. i don’t always like high amounts of carbonation but it works extremely well in this instance.  overall: as of my writing of this review this is the #1 ranked belgian pale ale. it’s an exceptionally unique ale with one of the most interesting and complex flavor and aroma profiles i’ve ever encountered outside of barrel-aged adjunct stouts. the taste is so exceptionally dry i’m honestly not sure if i love or hate this. i do know i’m going to pick up a few more bottles while they are still available in my area and probably run an aging experiment.
1121,Orval Trappist Ale,4.23,7/2/23 enjoying at home single bottle purchased at pig and fire.  highly carbonated so poured a very airy foamy light head which dissipated rather quickly. only slightly hazy golden in color.  aromas of bubble gum mead floral and a slight root beer aroma thats coming through.  very effervescent in the mouth. ends with a slight bitterness. flavors of banana bubble gum banana bread and vanilla. ends with a lemony bitter finish. and low and behold the taste of a fresh band-aid as noted by @tsar_riga! weird but its good! not a super fan of the finish but really good overall.
1122,Orval Trappist Ale,4.7,pours to a nice amber color with a fluffy head that drops quickly but then settles and stays. smells of banana and is malty and slightly bitter when tasted. smooth and silky mouthfeel and a really nice lingering finish that is so pleasant. as the beer warms in the glass it just changes and opens up. this is a very special beer.
1123,Orval Trappist Ale,4.84,poured from a 330ml bottle .  the look of this is a very red tinted brown  medium carbonation bubbles on the glass and a short lived large bubbled head that reduces to a tiny ring  almost no lacing . the smell is of yeast and apple  almost cider like . the taste follows on from the smell with highly prolific yeast that gets heavier as you drink  light apple malt and a pleasant bitterness  a slight hint of banana lingers. the mouthfeel is thick  sparkling and dry on the finish . overall fantastic . this beer is something else .
1124,Orval Trappist Ale,4.42,poured from 11.2 oz bottle to a goblet glass. looks a nice amber/burnt orange color with a huge pillowy ivory head that is fed by very active carbonation bubbles throughout the body. smell is earthy spicy a bit like a bourbon cocktail. taste is subtle with a bit of malt spice pepper brett funk almost stale hop quality. feel is light bodied well carbonated finish is dry. overall this is excellent beer of course. lots of complex flavor well constructed and very approachable.
1125,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,3.37,25 fl. oz. can served in an imperial nonic pint glass  this beer pours straw colored and clear. it is topped with an inch of white head that leaves spotty lacing.  light lime and fruit aroma.  light lime flavor. at least this version of ultra has some flavor.  thin bodied with a dry mouthfeel  michelob ultra is one of the worst abominations ever labeled as beer. at least this has a little flavor.
1126,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,4.13,pours a clear barely golden yellow with a head that is like champagne and disappeared fast. smell is limegrainssome type of fruit(probably prickly pear) taste is delivered clean and neat with a proportionate amount of the adjuncts which are discernible by the individual fruit. again feels well put togethercrisprefreshingwell carbonated. this beer being organic would not be possible without the huge buying power of inbev overall for a light lager with adjuncts i will rate accordingly to the style. this newer version says lime & prickly pear cactus. it is also 100% organic-and the abv is 4.0 instead of 4.2
1127,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,1.97,purchased as a six-pack of bottles from publix for $8.99. poured into a pils glass. posting this review from some notes i wrote down a couple of days ago but only now could post to ba.  l - extremely pale yellow with no head and minimal lacing. s - smells of corn flakes and faint lime. almost sweet. t - lime is pretty upfront followed by an almost artificial prickly pear. slight hint of dragonfruit and light hay. f - lightly carbonated and very light body. a step above la croix. refreshing. o - i dont hate this beer but i find it a bit boring - mostly due to the very light body unable to retain a lot of flavor. if it wasnt a light beer i feel like this would be a home run for the michelob lineup. glad to have finally tried it though.
1128,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,3.57,amazing beer but in a very specific way. very refreshing though perhaps not the highest quality beer on the market. youre not going to impress your boss but if youre having a nice afternoon kick-back or even a summertime party this is a really good option.
1129,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,3.62,solid american “light lager” with added “fruit” i.e.the prickly pear. i enjoyed this and suggest anyone disregard any rating that suggests it’s not “real beer”.
1130,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,3.68,patsy buckles 7/2020
1131,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,2.97,we at the 1009 are always on the lookout for new lime experiences. infusions have been on the back burner for quite some time since we first spotted it in early spring. the time was just not right. finally we needed something light at the beech and boy oh boy was this light. it was practically water. we plopped a lime wedge in the glass to accentuate that citrus bight. extremely deletable but sort of resembled a club soda with lime that would come out of the beverage dispenser gun at an applebees.
1132,Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,3.14,pale straw colored beer with a small rapidly disappearing white head. aroma of sweet malt with a bit of lime. sweet taste some lime. no cactus. thin and watery.
1133,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.25,pours a dark black color with a nice tan head and lacing. aroma has a nice whiskey and vanilla hints the taste has nice whiskey and vanilla notes a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a good imperial porter
1134,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,3.75,this just wasnt as dope to me as id hoped but overall still solid easy feel for the beer still despite the abv percentage but i just found it a little meh honestly. pretty high floor though still would have again
1135,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.07,vintage 22a  i remember hearing about og gonzo being an awesome beer when i first joined ba. i looked around for it for a while but never ended up finding it. fast forward 4 years and i end up finding the barrel aged version instead. let’s see if it can live up to my expectations from all those years ago  pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  there is a hefty bitterness to the nose here just really intense. i’m picking up on aromas of herbal hops toasted oak cacao nib earthy whiskey burnt toast toffee and light vanilla  it shows a similar bitterness in taste but it’s nicely done. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting cocoa powder burnt coffee dark toast earthy whiskey herbal hops light caramel and molasses. the swallow brings notes of burnt toast herbal hops earthy whiskey toasted oak cocoa powder toffee brown sugar and light raisin  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a brisk and bitter beer. finishes slightly sticky but goes down remarkably easy for the abv  it’s nothing amazing like i was told it was back in the day but it’s a very solidly done beer in the old school fashion
1136,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.06,12 oz bottle 2022 vintage  pours an extremely dark but not quite jet black. tan colored head. big aroma of bourbon and dark chocolate. taste has those elements but is pretty oaky and roasty. drier finish. medium bodied.
1137,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.15,purchased at wegmans in warrington pa. $20.99/4pk (12oz bottles). limited barrel series listed on the label. vintage 22.  pours a deep deep brown almost black color. a thick frothy mocha-colored head on the initial pour. fades to a scattered thin coating on top of the beer.  a roasted malty aroma with hints of whiskey.  a delicious porter. tastes of chocolate roasted malts with a distinct bourbon taste from the aging. slightly acidic bitter aftertaste. the 11.3% abv is well hidden but it’s definitely lurking there. not a brew you’ll want to rush through.  a medium consistency beer with medium carbonation.  overall a great barrel-aged porter. i’ve had other willett bourban barrel-aged beers and this is a true winner. nice job flying dog…cheers!
1138,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.07,solid black appearance medium light carbonation with about an average body. aroma is woodearthy roasted malt boozy with some dark chocolate. taste was almost dry otherwise stayed true to the aroma. this was very goodmore dry than expected
1139,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.31,pours dark as coal. nice tan head. the bourbon comes through in the nose and taste. nice warmth afterwards. very good stuff.
1140,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,3.81,poured into a 16 oz snulip glass never sure when it was bottled with flying dog. pours a very dark brown with a finger plus light brown head that leaves thick streaks of lace with excellent retention. 4.25  aroma is woody oak char leather vanilla bean dark chocolate and bourbon. 3.75  taste follows the bourbon hits first oaked vanilla char leather and dark chocolate. 3.75  mouthfeel is above medium soft carbonation a little dry and at 11.3% you know you are drinking something from the barrel. 4  overall the barrel totally takes over and for my preference a little boozy with plenty of other flavors but they kind of get lost. 3.75
1141,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.37,bottle dated vintage22a (whatever that means) into pint glass. pours a quite dark brown with a persistent light tan head. initial impression is a quite complex blend of dark chocolate roasted malts bourbon oak and a hint of molasses. mouthfeel is medium - slightly too thin for a stout but damn close. finish is clean and a bit boozy. overall this is one of the best imperial porters ive had.
1142,Barrel-Aged Gonzo,4.01,served a snifter from the bottle.  appearance: a semi thin dark brown espresso coloured body consisting of dark brown which looks black but is evidently transparent super dark.  smell: light liquor aroma which dissipates very quickly.  taste: from the front a darker chocolate malt coming off with heavy whiskey.  mouth: heavy whiskey feel which feels almost like a lighter body imperial stout.  overall: great grab which comes off boozy but still worth grabbing. always in a glass!
1143,Bière De Mars,3.4,on-draught @ jolly pumpkin ann arbor michigan.  grape must leather red wine soaked oak barrel faint caramelized sugars raisin. slightly tart slightly acidic not really sour.  b- / worthy
1144,Bière De Mars,3.5,750 ml bottle cardinal pub & bar stavanger. french style stock ale - ale aged in oak barrels. abv is 7%. hazy amber to brownish colour large off-white head. strong aroma of farmhouse. horse blanket lemons oak and apple cider vinegar. medium sour flavour with lemony and oaky notes fairly distinct and peppery hops in the finish. beware the ides of march!
1145,Bière De Mars,4.04,pours a cloudy brown color. 2/3 inch head of an off-tan color. great retention and great lacing. smells of sweet malt alcohol strong bacterial funk fruit and yeast. fits the style of a french biere de garde. mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. there is a strong tartness and dryness. tastes of sweet malt alcohol strong bacterial funk fruit slight wine and yeast. overall good appearance blend aroma adn body.
1146,Dark O' The Moon,3.99,whoa this is a full flavored pumpkin stout. chocolate cinnamon and rich malts. theres a lot going on here and is certainly not a boring stout. its tough to know what to rate this.. its busy not exceedingly busy and a unique take on a pumpkin stout thats not going to blend in.
1147,Dark O' The Moon,4.12,pours black as midnight with thin tan head that recedes to a ring. no lacing. pumpkin dominates the smell and taste followed by cinnamon then faint chocolate and dark roasted grains. tends toward bitter rather than a sweet stout. a tad less cinnamon would be better but in the universe of pumpkin beers this take on a stout is quite interesting
1148,Dark O' The Moon,3.71,very thick smell of spices fudge and pumpkin bar. the body falls somewhat behind on that promise providing a generic taste of blunt sweetness spice and some pumpkin bar on the back end. very spicy though. great body with sweet sumptuousness. a not bad stout altogether.
1149,Dark O' The Moon,3.86,dark bitter chocolate on the nose and at the front of the first sip is nice. pumpkin is dfinitely the star of the show. as always with me if there was a bit carbonation bite it would be rated a little higher. this pairs well with a good medium to strong mid to full bodied cigar. i enjoyed it with a 2012 by oscar short robusto. the flavors were very complimentary!
1150,Dark O' The Moon,2.75,not the best stout i have had. a little bitter taste. while canvtaste the pumpkin the overall taste is not good. i will not be buying this one again.
1151,Dark O' The Moon,3.58,umm i wouldn’t say that i’m mad. but your boy also isn’t stoked like a honey bee on a cheerio. i’m here with this water-like beverage. did arrowhead brew a beer? yu could fool me. i was told back in the day parents would water down a glass of wine for the kids to get them stoked and stuff. well here we have a beer that seems water downed for jr. but that’s not me. i’m raul. again… not awful. but this offering does not make raul day “boo!”
1152,Dark O' The Moon,3.14,black with thick brown head excellent retention splotchy lace roast aromas are quickly taken over by pumpkin spice hint of winter squash though lots of nutmeg and cinnamon some coffeeish roast a bit of roasted pumpkin flavor medium-heavy bodied with appropriate carbonation wouldve liked spice to be turned down a bit to let the base beer shine.
1153,Dark O' The Moon,3.89,deep dark brown with some ruby highlights and a moderate but lasting milk chocolate colored head and even a bit of lacing. the aroma is pumpkin cinnamon and chocolate malt. the taste is the same with enough spice to produce some bitterness up front then mellows in the middle with some herbal bite in the finish. the body is medium/full moderate carbonation fairly smooth. altogether this is an interesting take on pumpkin beer i think the stout style adds to the pumpkin deepens the flavor and rounds it out a bit.
1154,Dark O' The Moon,3.63,pours a chocolate brown with a modest two finger head. aroma is roasted malt and pumpkin which is mirrored in the taste as well. cinnamon is very noticeable. body and mouthfeel are quite light for a stout and low on carbonation. though pumpkin is present the roasted malt and to some extent the cinnamon seems to make its presence known a bit more. a different take on the usual pumpkin beer.
1155,Dark O' The Moon,4,appearance: deep black in color with a modest fine-beaded tan head with good persistence. an irregular unbroken ring is formed about the glass wall.  aroma: rich notes of cloves cinnamon and nutmeg vie with dark roasted malt brown sugar and spicy alcohol.  taste: the taste opens with pumpkin spices dark malts and spicy alcohol while bitter cocoa vies with brown sugar. later on three are cold coffee notes. at the close of the taste there is a bit of nut flavor and a lingering mild earthiness.  mouth feel: full smooth and very soft with a bit of soft carbonation.  drinkability/notes: a very well-made example and elegant that brings something new to a familiar style. certainly this is not a typical choice for april. nonetheless i found it quite pleasing.  presentation: packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass bomber with a pry-off crown served in a la fin du monde tulip at the lake house.
1156,Chinooker'd,4.29,shiny lighter gold color. clear. two finger head which recedes in a rocky fashion. ample streaks of mildly chunky lace.  clean aroma of fresh pale malt followed by a lighter floral hop. very inviting. no alcohol nose.  the flavor is more bitter than the smell. the malt remains solid and predictable. the body is moderate while the carbonation is slightly elevated. the finish is dry and peppery leaving a long pleasant aftertaste. overall this is a well balanced ipa with excellent complexities. a new top ipa for me.
1157,Chinooker'd,4.19,draught medium gold/amber color. subtle medium toast malt with a subtle allspice type spice aroma with a rather floral and citrus note. quite good a little bitey at first along with mellow mandarin orange peel medium roasted malt and a little tang in the middle of the taste with the citrus peel slowly fading to an easy bite.
1158,Chinooker'd,3.59,enticing with all kinds of west coast beauty the clear gold-amber body has a puffy off-white foam head.  this ones piney perfumey and--unsurprisingly for chinook hops--mildly catty. whats throwing me for a loop is just how intensely concentrated the perfumey-ness is. it almost seems like a glass of essential oil.  the body is moderately light with a crisp then expanding froth finishing just dry and quite old school bitter.
1159,Chinooker'd,4.65,can dated 8/11: a bit of chill haze on a light golden body; nice head that provides swaths of lacing. pretty dry medium light and fairly clean feel.  piney and slightly vegetal nose with just a hint of grass (lawn first then a little dank). there’s a vague and light sweetness somewhat fructose but i’m not connecting it to a fruit. taste has a more malty edge to this sweetness but it’s balanced by a earthy/piney bitterness. grapefruit pith evolves from this opening and lingers for a short while before pine regains the ending.  in the end a pith and pine ipa with a not too sweet malty opening - what i enjoy in an ipa.
1160,Chinooker'd,4.11,from a can marked canned on 5/11/21  pours into my tulip glass a clear golden shade with a frothy offwhite to ecru head. some soapy lace.  scent is earthy dank pungent and a bit skunky  taste is apples. mint. honey. reminds me of a honeycrisp apple. a lovely bracing bitterness creeps up as i sip.  mouth is juicy and lightly oily.  surprising how divergent the taste and the scent of this one are. typical excellent lawsons ipa.
1161,Chinooker'd,4.65,dudes be like “citra this motueka that” smh i just miss when ipa’s tasted like a mossy forest
1162,Chinooker'd,4.34,clear golden amber color visible carbonation with a dense head and lots of lacing. a quick swirl and the head kicks up releasing ... ... aromas of wet old growth forest butterscotch on oatmeal and candied orange wedges. just a terrific throwback to what real ipas used to smell like rich in malt that stands up to intense hop terpenes and bitterness. the flavor is an essay in balance. rich caramel malt complexity blends neatly into sharp pine and grass hop flavors. tongue tweaking hop bite tries to dominate but the sweet grain character keeps it all together. body is a heavy medium and the finish is slightly astringent but nicely peppery and warmly boozy. i have had many imperial ipas that dont have the complexity and backbone this chinookerd has.
1163,Chinooker'd,4.25,canned 11/17/20 tasted 1/29/21. excellent american ipa. i was a bit worried that i would find this too overwhelmingly bitter given the heavy chinook hop content and giant hop on the label but this turned out to be a very balanced beer. rich orange color somewhat translucent with a bit of haze. very appealing smell very fresh and tangy taste smooth mouthfeel and a nicely mild bitter aftertaste. would happily drink this again even though its not my absolute favorite style.
1164,Chinooker'd,4.39,chinooker’d from lawson’s finest liquids. purchased 0n 4/1/21 for $ 5.00 (including tax) for 16 oz can ($ 0.313/oz) from franklin beer franklin pa. in reefer at store and stored at home at 42 degrees. reviewed 24/1/21. stamped on the bottom “canned on 11/18/20”. served at 48.9 degrees in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. final temperature 53.2 degrees. appearance – 4.25. first pour – pale straw (srm 2) slight chill haze. second pour is clear and produces 0.5 cm head. body – straw (srm 3) opaque. when rear-lite opacity is shown to be due to extremely fine suspended particles and massive amounts of near-microscopic carbonation. head – average (maximum 3.2 cm aggressive center pour) floral white medium density average retention leaving a five to seven mm crown with a cross-cut saw blade edge fed by effervescence and a thin partial cap with many rocks. inserting the thermometer causes an upwelling of tiny bubbles. lacing. good. wide band of tiny to small bubbles with an occasional hole like torn cheesecloth. aroma – 4.5 – burst of resinous pine when can opens quickly weakens allowing some weak generic citrus to sneak through no malt no yeast. flavor – 4.5 – begins with generic citrus and resinous conifers no malt no yeast slightly bitter. no alcohol (6.5 % abv as marked on container) taste or aroma. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. ends with a mild but resinous bitterness sans citrus and pine but with some malt present. palate – 4 – medium almost watery mouthful of soft carbonation. final impression and summation: 4.25 nicely resinous and piney ipa reminiscent of the pre-fruity days.
1165,Chinooker'd,4.16,awesome wcipa old school style brew. plenty of pine and lemony resin (more lemon than grapefruit i get by a mile) with a long dry bitter finish. prepare to have your palette assaulted and reset
1166,Double Trouble,3.68,355 ml bottle courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 9.4% 86 ibus. surprisingly pale golden colour probably the palest american double ipa i’ve seen. big to moderate white head. distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney american hops also notes of caramel and orange marmalade. the flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish but not really extreme. the grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness. notes of caramel and orange marmalade again. very bitter aftertaste.
1167,Double Trouble,4.74,my favorite ipa. big grapefruit up front. alcohol is well hidden. a great citrusy beer.
1168,Double Trouble,4.12,hazed amber/gold appearance with a medium size head and decent lacing. subtle aroma; coaxed out some tropical fruit that resembled mango. hoppy flavor leaned more resinous than citrus and was well balanced by the modestly sweet malty backbone. lush aftertaste.
1169,Double Trouble,4,12 oz bottle pours a glowing amber-copper color nice thick head leaves a nice sticky lacing in my glass. strong grapefruit cotton candy aroma. full bodied but carbonated  strong citrus flavors nice lasting bitterness very tasty.
1170,Juicy Bits,4.28,16oz can. canning date stamped on bottom lip as 07/10/23. hazy straw colored body. three fingers of white head with initial pour. later some islands and a high cap. left behind are scattered strings of lacing. aroma of ripe citrus and tropical fruit. sniff of onion and resin. taste is ripe to slightly overripe citrus and tropical fruit. juicy and honey sweet. very little bitterness presence. aftertaste is a rapid skirting of the hops. very end is a pleasant pine resin expression. soft and thick mouth feel. coats the mouth and tongue. slight tongue sting. very good carbonation. very well realized neipa. beer candy like.
1171,Juicy Bits,4.03,l: opaque pale orange body with a dense white head.  s: tangerine grapefruit  t: orange juice orange zest lemon  f: medium bodied. juicy with a dry finish.  o: a juicy boi indeed
1172,Juicy Bits,4.57,smells of dank citrus tropical fruits pine resin and orange juice. the taste follows the nose. it has a balance of sweet and citrus like bitterness almost like grapefruit. medium to light body with moderate smooth carbonation. i got this in north carolina and i’m drinking it in summerville south carolina august 20 2023. at the gerber’s home.
1173,Juicy Bits,4.37,chugga chugga chugga chugga - juice juice!  excellent example of the style. totally crushable... too crushable.
1174,Juicy Bits,4.43,in my 45 years ive called six different u.s. cities home. none of those six have been greeley colorado. and frankly its not a likely candidate to become number seven. however thats not because i dont appreciate it. i currently live nearby and for all the s**t it catches it beats a lot of other places. the artistic talent the agriculture the community...the beer. its all underappreciated and underrated. so with that in mind i review a beer i never wanted to like but nonetheless fell in love with and have in my refrigerator almost all the time.  appearance: these days this beer pours about the same orange color as the can it comes in. well maybe more like the slightly more yellow-ish orange band around the bottom of the can. thats the perfect fit. its pretty opaque even for a hazy ipa. a fresh printer-paper white head rises slightly above the surface with a heterogeneous mix of bubble sizes. its not a tall head but it holds its ground. despite the opacity there is still a sense of liveliness in the bubbles rushing up the sides of the glass.  smell: i get orange peel vanilla and lactose in equal parts on the first sniff...pretty much every time. underneath theres a piney character with a touch or fresh cut grass. the latter of which compels that first refreshing sip.  taste: orange from the nose is still present but now its in 3rd or 4th place. if i didnt know better i would think that yuzu was added to this brew (tastes like lemon + honey) but even if its just the hops those two flavors ring strong. an pleasant earthiness provides the base/backbone to the palate. a nice bitter finish begs for the next sip.  mouthfeel: it seems sweet...at first. but it isnt. it may be bittersweet but its dryer than it feels like it should be. that sweetness as mentioned above gives way to that dry bitter finish. the body is somewhere between light-to-medium and medium-heavy. its oddly hard to tell and sort of depends on your mood. i dont think ive ever written anything like this in any of my previous 500+ reviews. its a unique feel.  overall: i refused to drink this beer for over a year after it came out. the hype train was too much for me. i did not want to like it. deep down i knew i would. a friend basically forced me to try it one night and the first sip was pure gold. is it life changing? no. is it perfect hazy ipa? no. that status is reserved for beers named le jus. well get to that another time. so what is this? its a legendary example of a relatively new style of beer and one of colorados finest examples of creativity experimentation and mostly high quality execution. nice job weldwerks. youre legendary.
1175,Juicy Bits,4.3,a: pours an opaque milky murky bright golden orange in color with moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate burnt orange + bright orange + pale orange + bright yellow + peach + apricot colored highlights. the beer has a three finger tall dense creamy sudsy foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a couple of medium sized patches of medium thick film covering approximately 15% of the surface of the beer each surrounded by a large patch of slightly mottled very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. slightly heavier than moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  s: moderate to strong aromas of juicy citrus/orange + citrus/orange zest + tropical/passionfruit + gooseberry hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of biscuit + oat + wheat malts with a light to moderate amount of sugary sweetness.  t: upfront there are light to moderate flavors of biscuit + oat + wheat malts with a light to moderate amount of sugary sweetness. that is followed by moderate to strong flavors of juicy citrus/orange + citrus/orange zest + tropical/passionfruit + gooseberry hops which contribute a minimal amount of bitterness which fades away quickly leaving moderate lingering citrus zest + passionfruit hop flavors.  m: medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. moderate amounts of creamy soft/fluffiness mid-body and a light amount of dryness in the finish.  o: easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly refreshing creamy soft/fluffy mouthfeel. enjoyable with lots of citrus + passionfruit + gooseberry hop flavors/aromas.
1176,Juicy Bits,5,this beer just recently became available in my area. lots of hype and well worth it. an absolutely amazing brew. its everything you want from a world class hazy ipa.
1177,Wookey Jack,4.25,draught ibu: 65 creamy light tan head. very dark chestnut that appears almost on the border of black for the appearance. co-mingling of pine grapefruit peel with the lightest touch of medium dark roasted malt rounding out the aroma. a touch sweet mild grapefruit peel pine and ample malt for the taste.
1178,Wookey Jack,4.38,12oz can about 3 months old  pours over two fingers of fluffy brown head into my snifter. retention is amazing after a solid few minutes there is still a sturdy finger of head. lacing is perfect. body is pitch black even when held to the light. looks magnificent.  nose is very spicey paired with a full dose of fresh baked bread. almost a candy sweetness but it doesn’t come across gross at all. smells fantastic.  you get that rye in full force on the flavor they really didn’t hold back here and i love it - rye is often hard for me to pick up. you also get some of that breadiness the roast doesn’t come out until it gets a good while to warm. the black characteristics aren’t huge but there is a deep maltiness that borders on molasses - it’s not gross or out of place at all. this might be a touch old maybe that’s why some sweetness is coming out but it’s aged quite well and has a nice smoothness once the eccentric spice passes - both being welcome.  carbonation is medium-low. has a somewhat heavy body that is just the slightest bit cloying - some sugars are present but mostly subdued by the substantial spice and moderate bitterness. a lovely mouthfeel.  the drinkability is phenomenal especially for a beer at this abv with this much going on. neither the sugar nor the spice slow me down one bit.  a lovely little beer that starts with a hoppy rye kick and transitions to a smoother darker offering.
1179,Wookey Jack,4.4,l - deep black with some mahogany highlights with a light tan head that leaves behind a solid amount of lacing s - fresh bitter piney hops roasted dark malt rye slight hints of chocolate floral notes and earth t - follows the nose: fresh piney butter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with roasted dark malt rye light chocolate bites floral and earthy notes. some citrus notes as well as hints of coffee f - medium leaning towards full bodied with moderate carbonation. smooth and creamy o - a truly great black ipa
1180,Wookey Jack,4.28,12oz can from a 6pk canned 11/23/22 into a 12oz tulip glass. l: pours jet black w a 1.5 med khaki crusty pock-marked semi-creamy head w vg retention to thick drifty edge foam low carbo visible but it\s there thick sticky lacing w banding. s: toasty caramelized chocolate malts a hint of black bread light char distant fruits earthy. t: roasted toasted chocolate malts malted milk ball candy an earthy hop bit combined with bitter & dense rye grains unsweetened bakers dark chocolate a hint of citrus zest pine resin plum berries dark fruit gently woody. finish is robust bitter. f: firm brisk well carbd then curves to a lightly churned whipped fluffy & plush gently wet medium bodied mouthfeel w a med-length finish robust finish. o: incredible tasting and feeling. complex deep & dynamic flavors that shift places to & fro esp in the center of each sip. curious delicious and has the appearance of a porter or a stout. i wish there were more beers in this style. wookey jack is outstanding.
1181,Wookey Jack,4.25,12oz can wine glass canned 12/22/22.  wookey resembles an imperial stout; no highlights and a magnificent cappuccino head.  christmas tree peppermint patty lavender. there are layers of chocolate behind all the pine and herbal hops.  malted milk balls and almost a milk stout richness though much more bitter and hopped than you’d find with that style. the pine returns in the backend accompanied by more floral flavors like lavender and lilac and earthy rye.  creamy medium body medium carbonation. it’s silky but balanced.  definitely a good black ipa with strong and interesting hopping.
1182,Wookey Jack,4.22,about pitch black with a robust sticky deep tan head. nose is a pleasant blend of hood and malt/ caramel. taste is like a toasted charry beer that happens to have hops in there like a dark pine forest. it all works somehow. i never seek dark ipas but made an exception when i saw this and having heard of how good it is. toasted rye and tingly hops slight hints of sweetness maybe some coffee but this is mostly an earthy beer. feels medium- full and silky smooth yet with good carbonation. this surprised me a bit. not my style but this is just a very well-made beer. don’t expect complexity or many different discernible flavors. this is mostly about crafting balance to a simple yet flavorful conclusion. going forward if i ever try another “black ipa” wj is the beer to which it’ll be measured.
1183,Wookey Jack,3.5,pours dark. tan foam. heavy hop aroma. big hop flavor and bitter finish. not much malt profile to speak of. pretty one dimensional. not overly impressed.
1184,Wookey Jack,4.49,12oz canned on 12-27-22 opened 3-18-23. 1+ finger beige sand colored head on a dark brown and opaque body. good retention and early lacing. big nose of leafy and earthy hops (id never place citra and amarillo) backed up solidly by roasty and also earthy malts. hint of menthol and coffee in a complex swirl of aromas. flavors of mild citrus lemon and bitter/spicy malt. medium (bright) body and carbonation substantial bitter punch and a long roasty and hoppy finish. outstanding.
1185,Wookey Jack,4.49,pours dark as coal with a tan head. nice lacing caresses the glass. nose is strong on the malts. taste is piney and roasted malt. very nice bitter bite on the backend.
1186,Wookey Jack,4.4,pours dark brown with a thick finger of tan head. smells like rye hops dark malt. the flavor is rye with good bitterness dark malts herbal citrusy it’s a tasty concoction for sure. this is one of the best in the black ipa category and the rye addition makes it great imo and i admit that rye beers are usually my jam so take that for what it’s worth and a great beer cheers!
1187,Wookey Jack,4.49,dark as a stout with a large tan head and very good lacing. complex aroma. not just the smokey roasted malts but also licorice dried fruit pine and herbal hops. taste keeps pushing the envelope as well. the resinous base pairs with the solid array of malts especially the rye. the focus shifts with each sip and cannot be easily pigeonholed. full bodied but not heavy. bitter but not palate numbing. a good alcohol bite but not head spinning. overall its not just about balance but how everything comes together
1188,Wookey Jack,4.29,got a few cans sent to me by @jonphisher beer nerd extraordinaire. poured very dark brown (black with dark brown edges) and had a *very* ambitious beige head which left sheets of lacing. the aroma to my damaged nose was coffeeish with a vegetable/plant like accent. wet hay maybe? i figured i was smelling it wrong as i generally dont smell much at all. the taste was at first brash and harsh; all the bite of the roasted rye and copious hops were dominant. as it warmed the malts came out to play with rye bread and roasted grains with almost a sweetness at times. the coffee and hops definitely shine the brightest but are well supported by the other ingredients. the feel was lively due to the carbonation added to the bite i enjoy so much in rye beers especially didnt distract from the sweeter aspects though. well done. oa very glad to have been able to try this outstanding beer.
1189,Wookey Jack,4.4,was so happy to hear that this beer was available again. found that the thistle draftshop had it on draft and the family went with me on mlk day!  poured from tap into a tulip glass. beautiful black color with excellent head and curtain lacing. smell and taste of citrus pine and roasted malt. lime and dark pumpernickel toast. wonderful bitter finish and rich full feel. hoped they had cans but still on the lookout!
1190,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.06,oh lordy this is great. pours dark darker than expected with a lovely effervescent rise of bubbles at the end. dark malty brown almost dubbel cola dark. aromas promising dark fruits rum and caramel. maltier and less sweet taste than nose would suggest with teast and bready finish. its complex and full of character. man andechs rarely put a foot wrong.
1191,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.52,i had this on draft 4/27/23 @ the beer temple.  opaque brown appearance.  nice khaki head; minimal lace.  burnt caramel honeyed grain mild cream & faint smoke notes in the nose.  medium mouthfeel.  burnt caramel honeyed grain & faint cream flavors.  a classic.
1192,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.29,appearance: pours a clear dark amber to deep brown color with a moderate light tan head. srm of 18-20. (4.00)  aroma: strong aromas of brown bread caramel some hints of dark fruit of raisin plum grape. (4.25)  flavor: strong flavors of caramel brown bread some hints of dark fruit with some dark grains yeasty and bready off the end. (4.25)  feel: medium-bodied strong carbonation. toasted mildly sweet finish. (4.25)  compared to weihenstephaner korbinian 3/15/2023: pours lighter similar head. stronger aromas. more brown bread toasted grains. less dark fruit and syrup. less cocoa. slightly more carbonation and yeastier.  overall: an excellent doppelbock here as expected. complex strong and bready flavors that lean a bit toasted. nice german yeast give a clean and dry finish. that is what makes this better than every other doppelbock ive tried. side-by-side this is the best.

1193,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.24,cherry brown with a steady puffy tan cap of froth; fresh baked bread red currants pretzels and raisinettes; dark bread crust red plums brown sugar carob bark and a vague herbal ending; fizzy medium dead smooth.  4 4.25 4.25 4.25 4.25  all the right moves. lest it be taken for granted it is burn-free attenuated silky - all of the things you’d expect from german precision brewing. if i’m forced to find fault it’s a bit undercarbed which makes it play a touch sweeter than it should. also surprised and delighted by all the fruit - i can’t help thinking that this brings many of the notes that make baltic porter great but in a much more drinkable package. that makes this even less bready and more estery than korbinian; i’d love to drink the two side by side. very digestif; it just slides right down but i’ll love to pair it with duck or pork chops.  proper wintery treat; deserves many revisits.
1194,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.67,i have been to the monastery in kloster twice and had this beer fresh from the tap. it has a deep amber color and flavorful aroma. it’s is powerful tasting but not so much as some other german doppelbachs. definitely tastes of caramel and very smooth. almost as good out of the bottle but i can’t think of any beer that is as good out of a bottle than fresh from the tap. this is probably my #1 doppelbach
1195,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.25,pours a dark brown with a fizzy head. the aroma and taste are all malt and caramel that deep burnt caramel that is the hallmark of this style and makes it not exactly my favorite. it is well in line with the other examples ive had and is very flavorful and clean. medium sweetness and bitterness. medium mouthfeel as well.
1196,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.74,outstanding. so smooth and delicious for 7.1% that 7.1% is packed with rich flavors to. its all balanced out right. perfect beer imo. 1 of my favorite beers. i recommend it.
1197,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.58,grabbed a 05l bottle at the local liquor store type place (benz) in sindelfingen. these quality beers are so cheap! been a long time since i’ve had this style and it’s been an even longer time that i’ve wanted to try one of this quality. very strong aroma almost barrel like and drinks quite strong for the abv. super strong malt character with plenty of sweetness and roasted finish. very clean and delicious!
1198,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.9,re-reviewing this one as it’s been a dozen years since i last reviewed it.  12oz can (5/16/2023) into a tulip. pours a clear amber color with a huge billowing almost duvel-like eggshell head with lots of sticky lace.  aroma is hoppy and grassy floral. piney northwest hops fragrant sweet malt.  taste is a blend of bready caramel malt and floral hops; light bitterness. clean water. nicely balanced. very old school.  mouthfeel is soft medium bodied crisp drinkable. something about it is vaguely reminiscent of beers brewed with belgian yeast.  overall a tasty classic approach to the apa one of my first go-to beers from the ‘90s. it’s somehow comforting to know that beers like this are still being made. ____________  previous review (8/19/2011) preserved for posterity:  3.83/5  rdev -1.8% look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 on tap in an american pint glass at bicks broadview grill. review from memory (less than 30 minutes ago).  color is a slightly hazy copper with a beautiful 1-finger head good carbonation.  aroma is floral and herbal hops.  taste is floral bitter hops with a nice pale malt balance. this beer straddles the line between a pale ale and an ipa. used to drink this often and its been way too long.  overall this is a good example of a northwest-style pale ale generous with the hops and always refreshing.
1199,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.96,12oz can. date stamp on can bottom is pkg on 04/20/23. very legible stamp. nearly clear deep gold colored body. one finger of white head which settles back to a thin cap and ring. leaves behind strings and spots of lacing. aroma of toasted malt with hops expressing the flavors of citrus and grass. taste has a solid malt base. citrus flavors of orange and lemon. slightly spicy. grass. floral. medium mouth feel which is substantial. some tongue sting. very good carbonation. a totally good experience all around.
1200,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,5,smooth flavorful thick feel perfect pale ale. clean tasting. yum.
1201,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,5,let’s try this one out of a bottle definitely great flavor piney crisp and light i love his beer cheers
1202,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.71,a nice easy drinking pale ale but prefer sierra nevada pale ale.
1203,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,4.19,on tap in the marvelous bryson city outdoors taproom. a deep orange amber with nice creme head good aromas of hop and malt and very nice tasting brew with a clean hop balance. very nice! maybe better than sierra?! pale ale excellence.
1204,Dinner,3.93,it was a great beer. overall it was a good change from the oj bombs...
1205,Dinner,4.51,poured on tap a snifter at churchkey dc.  beaming pale gold with hints of orange color and some fine carbonation. soft creamy top of finger presented with an off white appearance and bowled tilted lacing.  aroma is a wonderful spiced orange. juiced christmas mandarin nose with hints of spice and leafy green sensing hops. soft bodied and creamy vanilla sensing malt to match make an impressive hop nose.  palate is richly good but no surprises. creamy sensing body along with the flavors if anything its mouthfeel is the most impressive. mid palate rich in peeled and juiced orange tangerine notes. finish accentuates soft green herbs to an almost minty finish but a more pungent flavor and sharper astringency like a soft pine. still manages great balance keeping soft vanilla like flavored sweetness and that classic creamsicle orange like flavor.  its not that exotic or dynamic just a solid ipa done with exceptional base flavors. very nice!
1206,Dinner,4.84,so happy to finally try this historic ipa.  mango pineapple and a slightly dank herbaceous quality on the nose. palate is sharp and clean with pine hints of green onion and overripe oranges. mildly sweet malt undertones balance the profile. finishes clean and lightly bitter. superb.
1207,Dinner,4.72,one month old. bottle to wine glass.  l: pours an opaque golden orange with a foamy white head that leaves plenty of lacing. no floaters.  s: hoppy floral and fruity with notes of pineapple mango and sweet citrus fruits. slightly piney and resinous.  t: first sweet and fruity then bitter grassy and piney. sweet tropical fruits like pineapple and mango are paired with floral and herbal notes. grapefruit peel is also there. some earthy and woody undertones too.  f: full and a bit sticky on the one side crisp and crushable on the other side. medium carbonation. minimal hop burn.  o: multilayered and complex dinner works great as your everyday crusher as well as something you want to take the time to explore. fantastic beer that definitely lives up to its reputation.
1208,Dinner,4.24,(16.9 oz bottle 64 18apr23; purchased cold from the brewery yesterday... poured into my trillium fat tulip)  l: pale yellow-amber liquid slight haze; beautifully rocky sponge of white foam... the head holds for a bit but settles into a messy but steady cap though it doesnt lace much  s: pineapple green onion tropical taffy undercurrent of orange peel hint of pool liner vinyl(?!)... perhaps a subtle clean singe of ethanol... vibrant and eye-opening; sweaty later  t: triple sec zip up front getting lost behind the peppery spice of booze and grapefruity hop with an orangey-infused cereal malt drenching the palate floor all followed by a subtle swell of floral-ity that followed by more cereal grain all while the pungent peppery electric hop swizzle stings the roof of my mouth... as it goes (and maybe the palate becomes too stunned?) the flavors relax into an obscured obfuscated blend of pina colada and orange blossom water; moderate bitterness most apparent way after the last sip longest lingering flavor artefact  f: light-bodied nearing thin (too attenuated lacking supporting hop resins?) relatively pointed and punchy (booze)... the levity is excellent but im craving more luscious sticky leavings considering its exposed potency  o: visited maine beer for the first time yesterday and wow! are their beers far superior out of the bottle vs. draft... draft pours too cold muting flavors which were muddy anyway; the draft pour of this had little impact on my memory... im guessing (rhetorically) its limited availability has resulted in high marks?... they make solid beers and this is no different in its construct but its lack of depth is a disappointment (2115)
1209,Dinner,4.5,beautiful hop bomb. grab this one soon as you see it!
1210,Trappist Dubbel,4.26,poured beautifully into a chalice glass. almost a dark purple hue bubbly and notable for the little subterranean pearls of yeast floating away merrily under a short but effervescent head. notes of alcohol soaked plum and raisin. taste is similar with phenolic sharpness and molasses dark rich sweetness. surprisingly dry and crisp finish. great dubbel!
1211,Trappist Dubbel,4.37,330ml bottle - pours a deep brown with 2 finger foamy tan head with decent retention. on the nose theres a lot going on hints of bready malt dark fruits dried fruits and spice. taste-wise its just as complex as it is on the nose. flavours of dark & dried fruit are intensified balanced by a nice spice and a touch of caramel. lovely mouthfeel with good carbonation. truly outstanding dubbel.
1212,Trappist Dubbel,4.07,under a level head of tan foam is a clear body of brown and red hues that emulate purple under light.  the nigh impenetrably frothy head finally gives way to toasted pumpernickel with heavy phenols and a little bitter booze before finishing dry.  though at the far more casual even grungy café leffe in brussels i just love how every bar we go to no matter how shitty they might seem like they could be from the outside serves every beer properly and even recycles their bottles back to the producer. but man these beautifully massive glasses make it seem like you have so much more beer in front of you than you actually do!
1213,Trappist Dubbel,4.34,look: pours a reddish-brown and a sudsy head quickly forms and noisily recedes leaving minimal lacing behind aroma: plums apple skins dried figs candi sugar warm brown bread raisins light toffee concord grapes yeast and some earthy notes taste: light fruity esters led by apple dance quickly on the palate before being hit with a huge wave of malt flavors. toffee melanoidin piloncillo bread toasted crust and candi sugar all in play alongside the emergence of dark fruit that swirls in and out of the picture. light earthy notes appear here and there and closes with malt sweetness fruity esters and dark fruit mouthfeel: full smooth clean medium-high carbonation and soft and smooth on the finish overall: this is delicious stuff. this is a really tasty and well-made dubbel with great depth of flavors and aromas evident throughout. not too sweet not too fruity everything is in harmony as it all comes together to form a beer that is greater than the sum of its parts. recommended
1214,Trappist Dubbel,4,poured a 330ml bottle into a pint glass. a one finger bubbly white head on a cloudy brown. good head retention. some patchy lacing. spicy yeast in the nose. cinnamon. nutmeg. a mild hop finish. medium body and carbonation. a fine dubbel. a bit drier than most.
1215,Trappist Dubbel,4.4,halfway thru the initial pour i had already given it a 5 for the appearance: beautiful large off white head over a cloudy mahogany colored body. yeasty dried fruit lightly spiced aroma. complex mouthfeel added to the enjoyment with tastes that incorporated spices a range of dark fruits some sourness some bitterness and some tartness. a dubbel done right.
1216,Trappist Dubbel,4.59,pours opaque dark brown in color with one inch head. taste is dark bread and raisin. light body moderate carbonation sweet. it is a classic for good reason. while i prefer other dubbels this one certainly delivers. excellent beer.
1217,Presidente Light,2.32,not bad if you are sitting on the beach
1218,Presidente Light,3.16,poured from a bottle into a pint glass appearance - the beer pours a clear straw color with a small head of white foam. the head fades fast leaving a tiny bit of lace on the sides of the glass. smell - the aroma is strongest of a caramel smell mixed with a touch of bread and hay. there is a tiny bit of grain and bay on there as well. taste - the taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste with a little bit of bread and cracker. toward the end of the taste some light herb and hay come to the tongue. mouthfeel - the body of the brew is light with a carbonation level that is average. for the style the feel is good and makes for an easy drinker. overall - nothing great but it is an easy drinking beach beer.
1219,Presidente Light,3.63,i would like to point out that it is against site policy to call out other raters in a negative fashion. by the same token i would like to give my eternal thanks to my local in-person trader @tone77 for his massive recent drop-off that included this beer! i was astounded by how much beer he brought for me & shamed by the fact that mine was merely a paltry offering. 8=( i must atone to @tone77 !  from the bottle (his drop-off his call): presidente light pilsener style beer.  as i was prising the cap off of the bottle for an eventual pop! i noticed a number of carbonation bubbles beginning to appear. good! i like a well-carbonated beer. my follow-up slow gentle c-line pour still resulted in the formation of two-plus fingers of foamy. soapy rocky bone-white head with very good retention. color was yellow-gold (srm = 4 - 5) with ne-quality clarity just deep enough to entice the gelt gang of mammon croesus & midas to drop in for a taste. nose had a pronounced cereal-like graininess but not much in the way of either hops or unwanted adjuncts. hmm. mouthfeel was thin-to-medium on the big side for a lager. the taste was sweet mildly of perhaps (?) corn but the fact that it was nearly unidentifiable was a bonus. it was a little too sweet & malty for my taste but certainly well within specs for this style. i was rather impressed that it came across so well coming from a green glass (!) bottle. finish was semi-sweet bordering on semi-dry. again. more sweet than i would have liked but not bad overall. as far as a steady diet of it might be concerned i could see tiring of it fairly quickly. ymmv.
1220,Presidente Light,3.39,poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of light grains. taste is malts grains highly refreshing. feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall i found it to be more flavorful and enjoyable than many in this style.
1221,Presidente Light,3.25,6.5 yo soy dominicano
1222,Presidente Light,3.69,i was at an all-inclusive resort in the dominican republic. the only beer they had was el presidente and el presidente light. and because it was all-inclusive there was no charge for the beers. and the beers were everywhere. every room had a mini-fridge stocked with sodas water and el presidente. there was a bar everywhere. every pool had a bar. there were three bars on the beach. every restaurant had a bar. the main building had three different bars. when we checked it there was a bar right there at the check in and at every bar the only beer they had was el presidente and el presidente light.  and i was loving it. one day i had ten beers before lunch. i was drinking so much beer that i decided to switch to el presidente light because it has a lower alcohol rate and it was easier on the g.i. system. this will always be among my favs.
1223,Presidente Light,3,from a green bottle it pours a clear light yellow color. smell and taste had notes of floral lemon grass with cornrice and malts. mouth feel crisp but watered downice cold on the beach this one is ok.
1224,Presidente Light,3,b07
1225,Special Double Cream Stout,3.95,this was the first beer from bells and one of the first craft beers i ever tried.
1226,Special Double Cream Stout,3.54,pours dark brown with a very nice one finger head. aroma is nice roasted malt. there is a degree of sweetness to the aroma as well. taste is on the lighter side of moderate sweet with roasted malt though not as much as hinted at by the aroma. the brew is smooth and creamy. the abv is nearly absent. a bit on the watery side for my personal taste but drinkable.
1227,Special Double Cream Stout,4.09,poured stout black and much to my surprise had virtually no head but left off-white lacing. the aroma was mild for my nose but that’s normal. i did get that lactose sweetened malt and smooth coffee. the taste features malts galore cocoa and chocolate and coffee and toast and the expected sweetness was present just not as a major player. the feel was a bit thin for a stout especially a double but as the abv makes it possible to drink more than one without falling over the thinness works in its favor. glad it’s local i get some every year just never rated it before.
1228,Special Double Cream Stout,4.16,very tasty but light for a stout.
1229,Special Double Cream Stout,4.23,on first taste smoothness is more prominent than taste. not too sweet. has a well balanced stout flavor.
1230,Special Double Cream Stout,3.87,12 oz bottle glass: nonic pint temp at pour: 47 f abv: 6.1%   look: very dark brown-to-black with some chestnut highlights when held up to a light. 1-finger dark tan/light brown head that quickly dissipates to a thing cover and then that begins to disappear. i suspect that the age of this bottle is a factor here.  smell: sweet roasted oats and rich semi-sweet chocolate. touch of coffee here and there.  taste: initial molasses sweetness is quickly joined by roasted oats and some char. the semi-sweet chocolate appears and transitions to bittersweet chocolate and obvious coffee notes emerge. anise shows up near the end. finishes on a sweet fading chocolate and molasses note.  feel: smooth and creamy. body is in the heavier side of medium  overall: this stout is a perennial favorite of mine. i pick up at least a 6 pack each year if i can. the coffee and chocolate notes remind of coffee stouts but are much less in your face. the heavier body is nice. somehow this particular bottle hid in the cellar for 2 years. it didnt last long after i found it.
1231,Special Double Cream Stout,4.29,l - black with mahogany highlights and a creamy tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing s - notes of semi sweet chocolate roasted dark malts coffee - smell is somewhat faint t - follows the nose with semi sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts intermixed with sweet cream and coffee along with a somewhat nutty finish f - medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. smooth and velvety but a little thin on the finish o - a nice milk stout that doesnt really do anything wrong.
1232,Special Double Cream Stout,3.62,poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass forming maybe a finger of tan head. deep cola brown color. smell is sweet/roasty oats. taste is similar to the taste just mostly roasty with some sweetness. taste got a bit much after it warmed wasnt a fan at all at that point. medium bodied with moderate carbonation. a fine milk stout if you like the roasty nature.
1233,Special Double Cream Stout,5,its a very good strong and sweet stout with the heavier body and roasty characteristics youd expect from a stout magnified with the extra maltiness and higher abv of a double stout. the hop malt roast and sweet flavors are well balanced and overall its just all around an excellent beer.  on the newer brown label the words double cream are larger than the rest of the name so the two of us read that as doubly sweet stout rather than sweet double stout which is what it actually is - a maltier stronger version of a sweet stout. it\s still a cream stout so of course it is sweet but it\s not dessert levels of sweetness which is good in my opinion.  in other words a cream stout is a sweet stout and a double stout is a stronger maltier stout so this double cream stout is both of those put together. it makes sense in hindsight :)  ive liked pretty much every beer ive tried from bells although theyre the most expensive 6-packs you can buy (around here at least). when other craft beers were $10 for a 6-pack bells 6-packs were $17 so i normally never buy them.
1234,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.46,16 fl oz. can canned 08/10/23 just over 4 weeks in the can works for me. looks like this was brewed with two different types of mosaic? mosaic lupomax and mosaic t-90?  a: nice and cold the beer whistled a tune to me as a i poured it into the glass. looks remarkably fresh & sudsy. good burnt orange color body strong finger of soapy white head lots of spotty lacing. it looks damn excellent ill be real. s: bursting with fresh florals juice & nectar. this thing is hugely floral on another level. i can literally just shut my eyes and fade away into how fresh smelling this beer is. like being in a field of flowers in the warm sun. t: mosaic is hands down probably my favorite hop ever. such a beautiful clean flavor. hugely fresh & floral literally bursting with fresh juicy hop character at every small sip. not overly bitter or piney but there are definite elements of citrus pine resin orange juice papaya etc.. f: feel is extremely smooth frothy clean. medium-bodied with excellent carb. fairly easy to drink stuff also for the slightly higher 7.50% abv. not boozy or astringent at all. id probably call this dangerously drinkable.  overall a nice fresh incantation of daisy cutter certainly interesting and id be interesting in trying other hop varieties of this.  half acre mosaic double daisy cutter -----4.5/5
1235,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.25,16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $17.49. canned on 8/10/2023 so this is just over one month old.  look: nice clarity perhaps a slight chill haze. it is a beautiful rich copper color. this could totally pass for a festbier. there was a finger and half of off-white head that eventually dissipated to a thin layer. there is a steady stream of very tiny bubbles rising up the circumference of the glass.  smell: nice aromas of grapefruit orange zest peach gummy rings mango melon papaya and pineapple. its also piney and there is a bit of dankness. even though there are a lot of fruity notes the nose is balanced and its not leaning towards fruity or tropical. after swirling the glass there is a bit of a vegetal note that is oniony. the nose also has a creaminess to it. nice caramel malt note undertones.  taste: wow. this is really good. the taste basically follows the nose - it has all of those flavors coming through in a surprisingly balanced way and the flavors are also intensely delivered. the finish is moderately bitter with tons of orange zest and grapefruit pith on top of a tasty caramel malt backdrop. the finish is not sweet and also not super dry but definitely leaning towards dry.  feel: very nice mouthfeel - its medium plus bodied with a slightly viscous mouthfeel yet its very drinkable. the beer has a lingering chewiness. it has very soft smooth carbonation.  overall: it\s delicious. of all of the daisy cutter versions that i have had (base pale ale double daisy cutter and double daisy cutter - nelson) i think that this is by far my favorite. i also love going back to the regular daisy cutter pale ale but this is more unique and complex and obviously it\s a bigger beer. i also like how of all the double daisy cutter versions that i have had this one is most true to the original. i also prefer a west coast style imperial ipa to a new england style one and this beer is definitely west coast style. as an aside i love the colorful label design with the mosaic stained glass depiction of the daisies which is very clever and appropriate for the double daisy cutter - mosaic double pale ale.  from instagram: mosaic ddc is built on a similar malt bill as daisy cutter then goes all in on mosaic hops hand selected in yakima. this double pale ale leans to the west coast as the heavy dry hop of mosaic presents fresh peeled grapefruit & dank blueberry aromas with underlying resin & ripe allium lingering. a clear deep golden color lifts a dense billow of white foam. full bodied with lush mouthfeel our latest ddc flows with dewy bright aromas & flavors.  from the can: mosaic lupomax mosaic t-90
1236,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.21,pours a light copper color with two big fingers of head. the nose has bright notes of oranges and lemons. the citrus carries over into the flavor profile but it is not as bold as the nose would suggest. there is a residual sweetness that contrasts nicely with the bitterness of the hops on the finish.
1237,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.3,on draft at arizona beer house in tucson during a wicked rain storm. another great beer from half acre. they need to do more mosaics. cheers to all ba’s
1238,Angkor Beer,2.45,our first day in siem reap and this stuff is pretty much everywhere. including the restaurant our tour guide took us to for lunch. in any event...  the beer pours a golden amber color with a frothy white head that quickly subsides. still this beer really doesnt look half bad. on the nose i get canned corn and a bit of grain and really not much else. even for an aal this is a pretty unimpressive aroma profile. the flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this lightweight aal. theres some light sweet corn in the flavor profile and thats about it. what flavor there is dissipates pretty quickly and the finish is short bland and lightly bitter. mouthfeel is fairly light with the alcohol all but undetectable. drinkability is good i guess if your idea of beer drinking involves uncritical quaffing of a cold beverage while out mowing the lawn.  it gets pretty warm in this part of the world so i guess a beer as lame and insipid as this is somewhat understandable and even to be expected. as others have pointed out its inoffensive which is probably the best you can say about it. that being said next time im offered a beer at lunch or dinner ill opt for a diet coke or water instead.
1239,Angkor Beer,2.54,6 pack from fubonn market (pdx). was not as bad as i thought it would be. bright clear golden pour big fluffy head. smell and taste are grains corn and only slight traces of vegetal notes. feel is actually kind of creamy. not too sweet either. first cambodia tick.
1240,Angkor Beer,1.96,shared 330 ml can kindly brought home from cambodia by my cousin. abv is 5%. pale golden colour moderate white head. minimal aroma. watery mouthfeel. the flavour is quite dry and rather bland as expected with a hint of hops in the finish.
1241,Angkor Beer,3.2,when your in cambodia its decent and an easy go-to rather than paying the premium for imported beers. ignore the bad reviews when your at a bar though i cant speak about its quality outside.
1242,Angkor Beer,3.52,12 oz slim can traded from brutal farce poured into 16 oz budweiser pint glass.  clear golden amber color with a fluffy white head of 2 fingers. it gradually diminishes to a sliver no lacing.  aroma is husky and grainy slight sweet apple fruit almost cider-y. faint maize.  flavor is crisp and clean with a nice rice/plant/barley flavor. not much for lingering flavor except a slight champagne dryness and lingering pear and apple fruits. corn creaminess as well.  feel is crisp and clean with only mild starches on the finish. very good carbonation.  overall a poor rating is not warranted simply because a lager is not going to give the flavors that other more eccentric styles will. this is a cut and dry enjoyable quenchable by-the-book lager that stands with the rest. fear not take the dive you wont lose beer karma if you drink it.
1243,Angkor Beer,3,t14
1244,Angkor Beer,3.02,pours a very pale gold with no head and very aggressive bubbles  smells very grainy of cheerios  taste was more interesting light cracker with some floral notes and tart apple  very dry overly carbonated
1245,Angkor Beer,3.03,poured into a small pint glass. pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. aroma of grainy malt lemon and grassy hops. flavor is mild grainy slightly sweet malt grassy hops thinning out and getting astringent in the finish. light to medium bodied with sharp carbonation. on the grainy side of the adjunct lager spectrum but the malt pretty much dies out half way through the taste leaving the somewhat astringent (possibly just old) hops stark on the tongue. the neutral malt sweetness that usually make this style inoffensive is not present here this just tastes like a watered down lager. i liked their stout and decided to give this a shot but although i might welcome this on a hot cambodian afternoon its not worth revisiting outside its country of origin. drinkable but mediocre.
1246,Angkor Beer,4.45,angkor has a thick white head a clear golden bubbly appearance with splotchy glass lacing. the aroma is of fairly rich honeyed malt and bread crust. taste is similar with rounding hop bitterness. mouthfeel is light to medium and angkor finishes crisp and refreshing.  rjt
1247,Adios Ghost,4.44,opaque tan-yellow with a short bubbly head of off-white hue.  just after drinking a ho-hum ipa this exploded as super verdant dank herbal cannabic tropical spicy and everything else in between without anything offensive.
1248,Adios Ghost,4.38,shared can. not the freshest but a tick is a tick.
1249,Marshmallow Handjee,5,09/11/23 draft @ winking lizard canton
1250,Marshmallow Handjee,4.6,2022 vintage bottle 1316/3500  another milestone review number 1800! i figured since i have the highest rated ris on ba just sitting around that it would be a perfect time to break it out. this is my first of any dark lord variant and i think it’s a damn good place to start for the series. let’s pop this legend open and see what it has to offer  pours almost completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the roast is real in this one but it’s wonderfully offset by the sweeter notes as well. i’m picking up on aromas of drip coffee burnt caramel dark toast milk chocolate tobacco vanilla bean molasses toasted oak fig and light cinnamon  it’s similar in taste but with even more of a depth making this one hell of a complex beer. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting milk chocolate vanilla bean sweetened coffee toasted oak fig maple syrup burnt caramel sweet bourbon cinnamon black cherry and marshmallow. the swallow brings notes of milk chocolate charred oak maple syrup burnt caramel black cherry fig vanilla bean allspice sweet bourbon marshmallow dark toast and tobacco  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer. finishes mostly dry with just a touch of boozy heat  oh yeah this is amazing. thankfully a beer that lives up to the hype. maybe one day i’ll splurge on another bottle
1251,Marshmallow Handjee,4.86,2019 bottle purple sparkle wax. pours black with minimal head no retention. nose rich vanilla fruity with strawberry graham cracker. taste boozy chocolate toasted marshmallow. full body and minimal carbonation.

1255,Marshmallow Handjee,4.43,2020 release #0590/1500 drank during hurricane ian in orlando florida on september 28th 2022.
1256,Weissbier Hell,4.15,hazy dark blonde with rimming cap of foam; dough starter lemon + vanilla nose; fresh bread banana chips lemon creme + mild spice to end; smooth round slight.  4 4 4.25 4 4.25  nilla wafer nose + zesty crackery body. not especially heavy on esters or phenols but summery + easy. quality if a different take.
1257,Weissbier Hell,4.2,500ml bottle. label is stamped l2712. unfiltered deep gold colored body. initial pour brought forth several inches of puffy white head which takes a couple of minutes to recede enough to resume pouring. leaves behind some scattered spots of lacing. aroma is malty but has yeast esters of bubble gum cloves and minor banana notes. taste is sweet and rich with flavors of bubble gum cloves and some banana. also some orange-like citrus both a little sweet and with a little bite. solid malt base. sweet and malty in the aftertaste. more thick than medium mouth feel. coats the mouth and throat. excellent carbonation. yummy wheat ale with tasty yeast esters.
1258,Weissbier Hell,4.44,apricot peach honeydew melon double creamy vanilla some bitterness and a bit dry end. hints of nelson hop taste/ne style beer vibes. excellent. bottle from a dimple glass big head and aggressive pour to lower the co2 at 7c
1259,Weissbier Hell,4.44,pours beautiful cloudyhazy dark gold. tangy with immediate notes of banana and kind of biscuity finish. really refreshing and inspiring. one of the best weissebiers out there!
1260,Weissbier Hell,4.33,pours hazy dark gold. thick beautiful foam retains for a long time. taste of banana biscuits vert classi weissbier taste. quite vollmundig aka full body. very pleasant. all the best attributes of hefeweizen are present. the best thing however is really short sharp finish a bit bitter which balances the sweetness. arguably the best hefeweizen i tried.
1261,Weissbier Hell,4.59,enjoying a half liter in their braustuberl which is pretty packed for a german holiday weekend but also surprisingly touristy. much busier in the food and beer lines compared to weihenstephaner and much larger outdoor seating area with a similar a la carte ordering system. this is i think the last major beer from them i haven’t tried so i was happy to order it. super hazy yeasty and funky. not too heavy on the banana and other typical hefe flavors which is why i like this so much. this brewery is popular for a reason and their beer is seriously consistent.
1262,Weissbier Hell,4.2,appearance: pours a mostly clear light golden color with a largewhite head. srm of 8. (4.00)  aroma: strong aromas of orange citrus bubblegum light floral notes with her bready yeast. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of orange citrus bubble gum banana bread. some yeast clove and spice and then dry on the end. a light bite on the finish but overall smooth. (4.25)  feel: medium-bodied strong carbonation. bready soft and smooth. (4.50)  compared to ayinger brauweisse 4/2023: pours similar similar head. similar aromas with slightly more orange citrus and less cloves. more orange citrus and flower on the flavor. slightly cleaner and smoother and less rich and spiced than ayinger. similar though.  compared to andechs weissbier dunkel 4/2023: pours lighter milder head. stronger aromas. more bubblegum rich bread and sweet banana. less dry grains brown bread. sweeter.  compared to weihenstephaner hefeweissbier 5/2023: pours darker similar head. milder aromas. more sweet german bread malt/spice and banana bread. less citrus flower and yeastiness. slighter sweeter and more bready.  overall: an excellent hefeweizen. smooth bready malts with light orange citrus and flower with a classic yeasty finish. some sweet banana bread. slightly smoother and less rich than ayinger. incredibly smooth and complex yet still all the things of a hefeweizen. this could be better than weihenstephaner but a side-to-side may be required... (rating: 4.20)
1263,Weissbier Hell,4.31,bottle date: l0112  a - super hazy medium golden orange color with a dense one finger thick  creamy head resting on top and lots of tight vibrant carbonation.  s - bready dough light spice and banana.  t - big bready presence with banana cloves and citrus and finishes on the sweeter side with very low bitterness. long lingering bready banana cloves on the palate with a small shot of citrus underneath.  m - big medium chewy body that finishes on the wetter side.  o - this is a pretty fantastic beer thats worth checking out. recommended.
1264,Weissbier Hell,4,a good wheat beer. taste of cloves banana subtle sour yeast. a good example of this style.
1265,Weissbier Hell,4.28,picked up a pint bottle from tw-greenville sc 5-23-22 for $4.49. bottle code l1471; consumed 7-31-22.  beer poured a hazy gold with a very nice white head.  nose is very phenolic of cloves and bubble gum.  taste follows the nose with a lighter malt base that allows the yeast to shine which gives the classic banana and cloves notes along with a touch of bubble gum. finishes nicely balanced from an appropriate amount of hops.  mouthfeel is lovely as each sip finishes very soft and smooth.  overall an excellent example of the style!
1266,Moment Of Clarity,4.58,pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with a finger and a half of tan head. the nose is ludicrously good - it smells like milk chocolate syrup poured over crushed bittersweet chocolate pieces! the flavor faithfully follows the nose. the body is hearty for the style and the mouthfeel is sticky sweetness galore.
1267,Moment Of Clarity,5,milkshake quality. truly delicious
1268,Moment Of Clarity,4.28,look - really nice black with a lasting tan head rimming and lacing smell - maple forward with coffee second then chocolate taste - nice blend between chocolate coffee and maple feel - medium full body creamy light carb overall - another fantastic non ba stout by treehouse!
1269,Moment Of Clarity,4.72,from a 16oz can dated 11/11/22 into a tulip. can message: yes! yes! yes!  pours a thick opaque black with about one finger of brown head. incredible retention ok lacing.  powerful aromas of hazelnut coffee chocolate dark chocolate and maple syrup.  taste follows in reverse. chocolate and maple up front with coffee in the background. light roasty bitterness.  thick full-bodied wet mouthfeel. light bitter aftertaste. smooth drinking. low carbonation.  dont sleep on tree houses stouts! this is fabulous.
1270,Moment Of Clarity,4.27,16 oz can poured into a willi becher glass. pours an opaque near-black with a large beige head. aroma and flavor feature sweet maple syrup milk chocolate dark roasted malts and coffee. its a decadent stout and for me is just a touch too sweet. or maybe im not quite in the mood. its delicious regardless. smooth velvety full mouthfeel. overall a great beer.
1271,Moment Of Clarity,4.09,16 oz can from the brewery canned 9/16/22  pours jet black with half inch think dark tan colored head that fades into a thin ring around the collar. mildly roasty coffee aroma with milk chocolate. taste is similar fairly sweet. fuller bodied slick feel. overall very good but i think a bit stronger coffee flavors would help balance the sweetness.
1272,No Rules,4.44,black in color with no light penetration. fingernail of brown around the rim and covering half of the top. moderate soapy lacing. i smell milk chocolate coconut and bourbon. i’m tasting dark chocolate bourbon and coconut. it’s deceptively silky smooth for the abv.
1273,No Rules,4.53,yellow bowling ball i think means 2019. tried in january 2023. very boozy nose. head was tan. pour was darker than most porters but dont let that scare you :) taste is chocolate with coconut on the backend. while this is 15% it is a very smooth drinking beer. well done!
1274,No Rules,4.25,2021 on draft.  pours a pitch black. swirling gives way to thick oily alcohol legs almost like what you would get swirling a dram of bourbon. not much head as expected for 15% but a pencil lead thin ring the color of hot chocolate sticks around for the entirety.  nose is earthy sugarcane burnt brown sugar molasses toffee some cinnamon and vanilla  taste follows suit with the addition of barrel notes however subtle. this doesn’t drink like 15%. very easy drinking oily smooth and full. excellent example of the style and an over expression of what can be done with it. glad to have finally tried it. cheers.
1275,No Rules,4.31,draught this is a 2019 vietnamese barrel aged version. quite quite dark brown with a thin beige head. no light transmission here. sweet bourbon and molasses with some toasted coconut and toffee in the smell. slightly syrupy malt toasted coconut and a bit of spiced toffee in the taste with a tiny bite that lingers awhile. finish is a sweet dark malt and bourbon flavor.
1276,No Rules,3.81,2016 bottle courtesy of johnnyhops. age hasn’t been kind to this brew. will rate generously and re-rate when able to try fresher.
1277,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.79,this is probably the first beer im reviewing that you could consider a holy elixir as abbaye de brogne is a brewery located in an abbey in belgium since st. peter appeared to gérard de brogne a nobleman who lived around 20 km or so away from the abbey and instructed the knight to build an abbey to honor god.  that story allegedly took place somewhere around 880 ad making this a very old abbey indeed.  but in 2013 belgian brewmaster bruno deghorain along with his business partner gaby smet conceived a plan to set up a small brewery in the abbey with the intent to make abbey style belgian ales like they did in the days of yore.  this beer trappistes rochefort 10 is part of that dream.  is it any good? is this a holy beer?  lets find out!  classification:  its an ale and when it comes to belgian beers theres a few styles.  here were enjoying a belgian quad which are rich strong ales with bold flavors. typically theyre quite dark in color hovering around deep ruby reds and browns with garnet hues.  in terms of taste theyre very sweet on the palate low bitterness but packing an abv that will getcha there.  when it comes to beer belgian quads are some of my favorite beers next to stouts.  color:  caramel a deep caramel almost as if you left it on the burner a bit too long and it got dark brown. nice hefty butterscotch colored head that lingers for a long time.  aroma:  very malty on the nose which is the dominant smell that im getting. a little bit in the background is a faint hint of milk chocolate. little bit of caramel and brown sugar.  body & palate:  malt and caramel on the palate. theres a faint spritz of clove that i taste. little bit of a fruity taste that comes in almost like wine in a sense. i do want to stress its quite mild in that fruity taste which i guess is that faint hint of citrus that im attributing to these particular kind of hops that they use.  in terms of mouthfeel its pretty dense almost like coca-cola in that sense. very smooth even for the abv of 11.6% and fizziness of the beer.  finish:  it ends on a belgian malty dark chocolate sorta finish. this beer lives and dies by its malt character.  conclusion:  this is a heavy beer thats akin to snuggling up in your favorite blanket and bunny slippers and sitting by the fire. it lives and dies by its rich malty flavor that hangs around.  i definitely do not recommend this beer for a refreshing drink. this is more of an experience a beer you savor.  as far as holy well ill leave that judgment to those more suited to make that call as im not particularly religious.  but i bet if jesus had a signature beer i bet this would be his beer of choice.  as far as myself this has shot up to one of my favorite beers of all time and this brewery became one of my favorite breweries of all time. theyre a gem. only issue though is availability and price. if you can find it they are pricey so if youre after a nice beer on a budget might want to look elsewhere.  but you definitely get what you pay for this beer is wonderful!  until next time...  cheers!
1278,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.31,pours a clear brown color. big caramel head formation with good retention. malty chocolate on the nose. caramel taste mild warmth. smooth mouthfeel especially for the abv. a delicious classic beer!
1279,Trappistes Rochefort 10,5,one of the best dark beers out there!
1280,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.5,smell of caramel and brown sugar. taste that follows just as promised with a well-carbonated and spritzy body of brown sugar caramel some clove. a great quad
1281,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.24,pours a translucent rich brown with a fizzy cola head that settles to a thick 0.5 coaster with very good retention and lacing. nose is baked brown bread prune raisin date baking spice hop spice light alcohol cinnamon fruit cake. taste has moderate booze-soaked fruit sweetness treacle spiced red wine. spiced hop on the finish with a lingering sweet booziness. mouthfeel has moderate weight and light fizzy carbonation. far more mild than westy 12 in terms of its fruity booziness with much more spice and hop character.
1282,Trappistes Rochefort 10,3.18,apparently this is one of the best beers in the world...so reviewing again. many think that it is better than westerveleren 12.  aroma is nothing special similar to a canned pelforth brune. lots of large bubbles not as beautiful as westerverelen or a guinness. and definitely not a chouffee ipa or duvel tripel hop. but as the froth reduces it improves.  the best thing about this beer is the hop aftertaste. its one of the best mouthfeels of any beer. really amazing. but it doesnt compare with a chouffe ipa in terms of flavour for me.
1283,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.38,allowed to acclimate to 50°f (a little too cold but i let it warm more) and poured into a chimay goblet.  pours a hazy carob brown with lighter sediment floating around and a tan quickly dissipating tan head (forgot to pay attention to how tall).  initial aroma is a slight smell of high alcohol with a hefty dose of yeast and malt slight notes of milk/semisweet chocolate wafted around before i smelled it directly. returning for a second round of smelling i notice a slight note of grass. a third round reminding me of a general whiskey smell.  initial taste is again alcohol followed by malt followed by milk/semisweet chocolate followed by light alcohol burn all over the tongue but concentrated in the middle. third and fourth sips yield raisin and/or generic dark dried fruit notes upfront as well as revealing a sweetness similar to the natural sweetness of dried fruit. sipping after that uncovered a spiciness that comes before the sweetness combined with the warmth from the alcohol it feels very sensible. i have to admit that for me personally it becomes harder to drink as it warms more because i have a hard time with spirits and the alcohol in this one is not hidden but its still got fantastic flavor.  mouthfeel is smooth although a little thin and the carbonation disappears.  it tastes like a fireplace super cozy and tastes like home kind of beer. this is the perfect beer to drink while wearing a cotton sweater by a fireplace or a library or den.  its expensive but it can be justified because its excellent and has a high abv. will absolutely be purchasing again as well as recommending and purchasing the others in the line.
1284,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.9,one of the very best in the world! outstanding! one of the best and likely the best monastic belgium triple. its been around for several hundred years. but its not for the faint of heart. a serious amount of alcohol here and does not go good with anything but monk bread. but a perfect beer if love a great ale made the old way on open vats or a monk sworn to celibacy
1285,Trappistes Rochefort 10,5,truly world class. this beer lives from his malts. multi faceted experience; starts with banana goes to bread and caramel at the end. superior carbonation. one of the best non hoppy brews in the world!!!
1286,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.99,the king of all hefeweizens! pours a foggy pale golden color with a white fluffy head. smells of lovely banana and clove with a taste to suit. finishes very smooth excellent and refreshing. this is definitely my favorite beer as of now and my local stores always carry it which a big plus. i would 100% recommend this beer its also a great compliment to a nice meal.
1287,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,heavenly brew..! after reading the rave reviews about beer for many years i finally spotted it at a discount grocery store. what more can be said that hasnt already been said..?
1288,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,gods gift to earth. an absolute must try beer. no complaints at all.
1289,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.84,the beer boasts an opaque light-orange color and a thick lasting snow-white head. the nose is wheaty and spicy with abundant phenols -- notes of clove & banana. carbonation is lively. the palate is delicious and complex. this is a supremely quaffable & refreshing ale.
1290,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.65,one of the finest brews on earth it has stood the test of time. full bodied and way smooth the hit of banana in the mouth coupled with clove on the nose makes for a complete sensory experience. simply magnificient all around..
1291,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.83,excellence beer! silky bread and caramel notes!
1292,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.58,a great wheat beer good year round tart and creamy.
1293,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.55,hazy golden color with a beautiful head that lingers forever.  the mouthfeel is so silky. i would love stronger aroma and flavor... it is definitely a delicate profile.  a beautiful beer.
1294,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,the “rolls royce” of beers… there is nothing that comes to mind that can even compare.. at 5.4% alcohol.. you can hardly taste any grain… the absolute go to beer if you can afford it in usa… very expensive and hard to com by…
1295,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,this is my favorite weiss bier the fact that it comes from a brewery that dates back to the 11th century is a nice little bonus. it has the perfect balance of alcohol taste with that of wheat fresh baked bread and some banana it’s earthy yet refreshing.  10/10 a must try!
1296,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.97,excellent tasting beer. ive had a lot of german wheat beers but this is one of my favorite.
1297,Le Terroir,4.49,(375 ml cork/cage bottle 6% abv 61504:28 220818k11t dry-hopped with amarillo and idaho 7; purchased off shelf at beer peddlers yesterday... decanted into a teku)  l: clear sunbeam-yellow hued liquid; near two-finger high cottony white foam builds on the pour and gracefully recedes into a tight steady cap... as the sips ebb and flow some thin frosty bands of lace stick  s: exquisite blend of diaper funk and fresh flower arrangements hints of fruity marshmallow and peach skin; white wine and berry notes emerge as the foam falls... i could sniff this for days... by the end before first sip a peach yogurt scent takes hold  t: considering the aroma journey i wasnt expecting quite this dry of a base... following a pithy floral vinous first contact peach yogurt briefly flashes passing with a tart tail finishing with the fruity essences panning out to the sides of the palate ultimately leaving a lightly-crackery aftertaste which gradually gets more mineral and leafy the center opening up and airing out exposing a lasting spectre of the funky barrel/woody character... thats just the first palate-attuning sip... second sip on its delicate notes of fruity breakfast cereal dancing atop outdoorsy wet-meadow earthiness and a lightly acidic lightly nutty-yeasty foreground... dry as a mf... i hesitate to say it slightly reminds me of a gueuze but it does  f: what can i say?... it coats and caresses my palate with the sultry mist of a summer fling... soft rosy warmth stoked at the back of the palate... dry swift moist feathery-light; on point effortless  o: again i hesitate to say... but i believe i enjoyed this more than any rr bottles ive had over the years which inevitably is going to now make me go back and try a bunch of them... the hop choices here seem astute but its a bit difficult to sort out the origin (hops or bugs) of the subtle nuances... my first le terroir; good stuff and it wont be the last (2154)
1298,Le Terroir,4.29,look - clear copper with non stop bubbles with a nice last white head with a really thick rimming and great lacing smell - earthy tart lemon orange taste - tart but not overly tart with a citrus lemon orange and still a slight grainy earthy slight floral feel - creamy medium full body with a very light carb overall - really tasty beer overall - really tasty even after being aged
1299,Le Terroir,4.94,this is a superb beer. probably the best beer ive ever drank. the balance is perfect with superb complexity and depth. the initial sour notes fade to a rich full sweet centre finishing clean and sour
1300,Le Terroir,4.26,deep amber with white film; lemon zest and jasmine nose; lemon sorbet chalk cheese rind tangerine comeback; dry + clean.  4 4.25 4.25 4 4.5  best match of citrusy sourness + citrussy hops ever. bright + clean. so sessionable. moar!
1301,Le Terroir,4.43,while ive had 73 ales in this style i understate the situation and say that i am no fan for wilds. of the first 200 wilds listed by their number of ratings ive had 22 and only 1 did i rate above the average.  le terroir is the second.  since i am such a sour-puss i should like sour ales. only rarely is that pairing made.  but this review is supposed to be about le terroir. it looks better than the competition who often look confused and few are foamy. terroir smells like tart fruit. and it tastes that way; yet its sweet and sour combo has this rare drying sensation that continues. best yet it does not interfere with my meal of soup and spinach. too many wilds overpower. terroir stays within itself and treats food as a friend.  i suppose that comes from hiring rodenbachs brewmaster and the mark he left. ive made my micro-review of new belgium elsewhere and admire the founders who cut their workers into the deal who in turn sold the company to a big brand manager. i hope they made the right decision and the creativity of le terroir continues.  this is my second addition to purposefully climbing beer of fame now @ 163. a votre sante !
1302,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.67,pours black dark tan head absolutely gorgeous ba imperial stout. the nose features the spicy peppers cinnamon vanilla cocoa and a bit of booze. wow.  the peppers and cinnamon are forward on the taste and amazing with plenty of vanilla cocoa and barrel notes to provide balance and a delicious flavor profile. this is truly amazing.  the mouthfeel is rich and creamy perfect for this beer. i’m a huuuuge abraxas fan and this is a little bit better imho.
1303,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.64,2021 lottery bottle. poured at 57°. black with ruby edges; dark tan head fizzled out quickly; poor cap retention thin ring a few spots of lace; thin legs on swirl. bourbon nose with cinnamon sweet plums and green chilies right behind; some boozy heat on the retro nasal. taste follows nose; more sugary plums and sweet bourbon; figs molasses and brown sugar; very light chocolate/cocoa nibs; bourbon and dark fruit finish. hot bite on tongue from peppers and booze; full minus body not at all adjuncty; smooth silky feel; full mouth warmth from alcohol (13.3%) and hot peppers. overall loads of well balanced flavors; base and barrel merge seamlessly; long sweet bourbon and dark fruit linger leaving cinnamon and hot chilies sauce aftertaste. a sipper for sure!
1304,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,poured at fridge temp. pours black as night. a minuscule layer of brown head appears and then flees. tiny bubbles throughout.  the nose is insane. big toffee and dark fruit. raspberries come to mind right away but after a few minutes that fades a bit. in comes cocoa nibs cinnamon coconut vanilla and coffee.  the taste is amazing. coconut vanilla chocolate and cinnamon are apparent. maple syrup seems a lot stronger now. however the cinnamon and coffee are strong. flavors are intense.  mouthfeel is pretty thick and the beer is clearly low in carbonation. overall a wonderful and intense beer!
1305,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.59,look - fantastic thick black with a nice tan head lacing and rimming smell - bourbon woody caramel cinnamon vanilla blend boozy taste - nice woody caramel bourbon carrel with a nice cinnamon vanilla cocoa with a very light spice feel - medium full body with a slight cirsp overall - incredible
1306,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,5,older bottle. stunning
1307,Chocolate Rain,4.5,750ml bottle at share 2015 vintage. near black pour small beig e head fades away. aroma is roasty dark chocolate boozy with light fruity accents. taste drops in raisins and prunes on top of the sweet roasty malts full and creamy. pretty damn warm too. everything i have heard about this beer is true. a real classic that has aged well.
1308,Chocolate Rain,4.08,2021 vintage 20.2% abv.
1309,Chocolate Rain,4.07,this one pours a surprisingly thin dark brown that emits a fair amount of light around its edges; brief cola fizz with no head retention or lacing. nose has a leathery molasses and salty licorice black tuesday backbone melded with semi-sweet chocolate chips. some vanilla and oak as well. nothing overpowering and all the aromas feel like they\re integrated into the beer rather than an adjunct or flavoring that\s thrown in on top and feels artificial. taste follows - it lacks the overpowering leathery and brackish boldish of black tuesday but the cocoa additional doesn\t tilt this sweet. instead it takes some of the rougher edges off bt while still maintaining an overall savory (or at least no sweet) stout. lots of alcohol barrel and bourbon spice lingers nicely on the loooong finish. plenty of heat as well but again not overpowering. i do find the feel a little thing (similar to gray monday) but not everything needs the chew of bcbs. i still prefer bt but this is a fine variant.
1310,Chocolate Rain,3.8,2017 vintage  it’s been a while but i’m back with another bif beer from @eziel! this guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff and i’m hyped to try this one out. i really liked the raspberry cobbler black tuesday variant so i have high hopes for this one too. let’s dive into it  pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing  the nose here is quite pungent perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. im picking up on aromas of cocoa powder raisin dark chocolate vanilla bean heavily roasted coffee hot bourbon light toasted oak and molasses  whereas the nose was charmingly pungent the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. on the front end of the sip im tasting hot bourbon burnt coffee vanilla bean dark chocolate caramel brown sugar and molasses. the swallow brings notes of hot bourbon toasted oak vanilla bean cacao nibs black cherry burnt coffee toasted oak and caramel  a full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat  damn i dont know if it was the age but i really did not vibe with this one. its hard to say if it was once well constructed as it doesnt even really show a shell of what it used to be save for the aroma. hopefully the black tuesday reserve he sent me is much better
1311,Chocolate Rain,4.57,drinking a 2013 in 2022 look - black and thick no real head smell - chocolate vanilla caramel booze taste - boozy chocolate vanilla caramel lots of barrel feel - full body very very light carb overall - not bad for being 9 years old
1312,Chocolate Rain,4.9,tummy!
1313,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.31,a - pours a hazy golden orange with a thin white head. tremendous amount of sticky lacing.  s - aroma is orange mango grapefruit and dank hops.  t - the taste is orange tangerine grapefruit strawberry honeydew lime peel and a lingering bitter hop bite.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. soft mouthfeel with crisp dry finish.  o - really nice.
1314,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.54,canned 3/10/23  i don’t buy much other half since by the time it makes it to my area it’s usually a few months old. that being said tavour has been getting me back into them lately with relatively fresh cans. admittedly i should’ve gotten around to this one sooner since i’ve had it for a few weeks but i’m excited to try it regardless. let’s get into it  pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  the nose is vibrant and tropical but there’s a nice bitter hop character to it as well. i’m picking up on aromas of orange juice lemon zest overripe cantaloupe floral hops bready malt gooseberry dank weed dried blueberry and light grass  and it manages to keep up that wonderful balance in taste too thankfully. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting overripe cantaloupe pineapple juice bready malt grassy hops blueberry candy dank weed and light orange zest. the swallow brings notes of orange zest gooseberry crackery malt dank weed grassy hops pineapple juice overripe cantaloupe and light grapefruit zest  a medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a smooth yet crisp beer. finishes mostly dry and refreshing  oh yeah this one is great. super drinkable for the style with a great balance
1315,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.64,i thought i had this one before and loved it. however that was double dry hopped double mosaic daydream. and i loved that. but i love this one too.  hazy pale orange juice with little head and lacing. hoppy citrusy scents of orange and pineapple slightly tangy and dank. taste presents notes of dank tangy zesty citrusy notes of pineapple lemon and orange. lighter to medium bodied very clean mouth watering subtle alcohol. an excellent example of the style.
1316,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.48,16 oz. can for $10.99 - canned on 10/14/22 - i had a $5 reward coupon so i scooped this one up for $6.99 look - golden and orange hazy creamy head good lacing throughout this session smell - mango blueberry orange peach little bit of dank ripe fruit taste - mango blueberry orange peach pineapple - sweet fruit flavor followed by some hoppy bitterness feel - soft medium mouthfeel light-medium carbonation finish has a little bitterness and dryness overall - great brew that showcases the mosaic hops. really nice fruit flavors come thru with a soft mouthfeel and a low bitterness at the end. this brewski is smooth and goes down really easy at 8.5% abv. its even more enjoyable while listening to dream warriors by dokken.
1317,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.49,poured from the can into a spiegelau ipa glass. canned nov 28th 2022.  light touching head with ultra fine bright white bubbles. lots of pill like lacing and even leggy. island creamy top with a soft shape sitting on a slightly hazed dark lemon with hints of noticeable fast rising carbonation.  a bold nose. dank hits of earth and must hop but also a real tropical passionfruit like flavor. hits nice and spicy too with a bevy of hop explosive power. nice and diverse but just misses the wow factor and other beer character balance.  palate is just real nice. juiced up and filled with a rich malt coating hop flavoring of passionfruit pineapple and a real jammy like texture. coats a little chalky but also brings a real nice spicy earthy hop bitterness on the finish. good notes of tropical variety too guava mango all sorts of fruit tropical goodness.  very nice neipa with a good earthy bitter kick and tropical bonanza.
1318,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.52,really good neipa all around but only negative is that it’s bit chalky in the finish.
1319,Corona Extra,2.33,gets a 5 for look in the bottle or a 1.25 out of the bottle. its an amazing design and the font is unbelievable. this time i drink out of the bottle so it gets a 5.  rereviewing after just drinking a corona premier to compare. that is probably the worst beer i have ever had. i do like the bottle design and the stegosauruses however i am reviewing the beer not the artwork.  rather a pale colour similar to most beers from mexico. aroma is almost nothing with a little lime. and there is no lime or lemon added ; ) the aroma is a little better than the premier version.  taste is so light i\m completely confused as to why there is also a light version and a premier version that are even lighter. hops are mega subtle. but they work well with the lightness. this is much better than the premier version. in hot weather i guess this is kind of good and refreshing.  mouth feel is ok. the hops kind of hit you after the initial wateryness. the mouth feel is the best thing about this. and it was the worst thing about the premier version.  overall this isnt as bad (without lime) as i was expecting. its much much better than the premier. beer advocate reviewing seriously need to wake up as this actually has a much lower score.  as a light beer this is actually ok. im just confused why they decided to create even lighter beers! i feel like if they created another one i would hover. maybe if i go to mexico and live in temperatures each day of 40 centigrade and sweat about mafia murdering me because of giving bad reviews to corona premier i would also like corona premier? maybe ; )
1320,Corona Extra,2,this beer reminds me of every dad’s refrigerator in the early 2000’s. it seemed like whenever i’d go over to a buddy’s house this was the beer in their dad’s fridge so i think of that more than i do the cheesy beach commercials. i believe i had a corona extra at a bar over fifteen years ago so this was pretty much like a first impression today. corona extra has the skunkiness of a heineken without any of the heineken goodness. it tastes bitter and not in a fun “beer” kind of way. i added lime to it and now i totally understand why that’s a thing but on its own i give it a very generous 2 out of 5.  style: mexican lager | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 4.6% | rating: 2
1321,Corona Extra,2.48,corona is one of those beers most folks have tried at least once in their lifetime. it’s readily available throughout the united states and abroad. it is nothing to write home about either. its smell is near non existent when cold and as it warms up to a room temperature it has a mild skunk smell. its taste is bland when ice cold. when warm that skunky and almost metallic like taste comes through hard. the feel is well.. there is none. you can easily drink these beers down when ice cold. it’s a decent ish beer when mowing the lawn or doing work outside on a hot summer day but so are many other brands at less cost.
1322,Maman,4.43,pours jet black with a still no foam look. heavy oily legs cling to the glass after the lightest of swirls. it looks like motor oil thats been run hard through a motor for ten thousand miles - thick dark and viscous. aroma pushes dark fruits plum and chocolate across the nose first. char barrel bourbon and hearty roasty and toasty malts sit behind. dark fruits is the dominate note at least immediately out of the fridge. mild brownie shows up as the beer warms. flavor profile is dark fruits caramel toffee tobacco raisins fig plum and chocolate. the blend of notes conjours up thoughts of barleywines but retains heavy stout notes via late roasty and toasty malts. bourbon barrel and char are all present to varying degrees molding into the 14.6% abv well. brownie and more chocolate start to show up as the beer warms masking some of hte initial dark fruit notes. it really develops a wonderful depth to the flavor profile after a fairly simplistic aroma. mouth feel is thick and viscious but with an otherwise flat and still effervescence. overall a blend of hearty stout and barleywine notes. it has a lot of dark fruits for a heavy stout but despite that retains a good balance despite being in wine alcohol territory. massive slug so -0.25 from overall.  served in a 15.5oz speigelau tulip from a 750ml bottle. 2020 vintage. consumed/reviewed 02/12/2023 as a super bowl warm-up for chiefs vs. eagles!
1323,Maman,4.9,#164 yummy!
1324,Maman,5,the perfect stout. insane aroma of chocolate and molasses. thick and chewy coating your palate forever. chocolate caramel molasses and a hint of spiciness. incredible!
1325,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.13,from a 500ml bottle dated 03/11/23. served in a spiegelau tulip glass.  pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. a generous finger of lush coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily super-slippery lacing.  nose is… fruity? a sweet candy-like coffee aroma and totally unexpectedly raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla cinnamon and chiles.  taste is sweet but not heavily so with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy. a slick cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. there’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much.  feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle prickly carbonation. chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation lightening the mouthfeel further.  overall pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. i won’t call the flavours ‘muddled’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which weirdly for my palate comes across very fruity and raspberry-like.
1326,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,3.88,2022 pint can chilled left to warm. flat black on the pour thick sticky tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast. smells like cinnamon vanilla cacao nibs and chilli peppers being muddled together. tastes the same. just too much going on. cloyingly sweet and thick slightly gritty too much cinnamon and who needs hot peppers in their stout? overall i’ve attended 5 hunahpu’s day celebrations at the ccb spruce street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.. but way too busy and quite over rated.
1327,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.33,2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer.  appearance is typical for the style which means its a nice looking dark dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head. nice legs. aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent but not in an artificial way. plenty of sweet molasses chocolate a hint of vanilla and some faint figs / raisins. that description doesnt do this any real justice so in summary this beer smells great.  taste is interesting. nowhere near as sweet on the nose with some naturally bitter cacao notes cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer. the spiciness is goldilocks.....just right. a bit less and they wouldnt be notable. a bit more and they would overpower. theres a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer. fully bodies and smooth leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming.  overall this is excellent.
1328,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.31,2018 vintage  we’re nearing the end of the bif beers i got from @eziel back in february and this one is a heavy hitter. this has been a big want for me for a while so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. let’s see what this famoud spicy stout is really all about  pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  this is highly complex in the nose not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. i’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs vanilla bean chili pepper spicy whiskey burnt coffee sweet toffee brown sugar and light charred oak  this is a bit restrained in taste perhaps due to the age but i still really enjoy it. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting dark chocolate roasty coffee chipotle pepper vanilla bean spicy whiskey toasted oak cinnamon and toffee. the swallow brings notes of milk chocolate chipotle pepper vanilla bean caramel toasted oak earthy whiskey and burnt coffee  a full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat  while i enjoyed this i’d hardly put it on legendary status. again maybe it’s the age so i’d love to try it fresh but even still
1329,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.42,2020 amalie arena edition...large capped bottle.  pours very dark with no light shining through next to no cap or lacing.  dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff.  super smooth nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolate/brownies/cinnamon/dark malts.  delicious creation no doubt aided by a few years in the bottle....get some of this fine nectar if ya have the opportunity.
1330,The Mad Elf,4.08,cold bottle into a snifter. reasonable foam settles down fast. aroma is festive spiced cherry pie. tastes like winter in maryland. spicy and sweet a tad of tartness too. alcohol makes a big noise.. feel is medium to thick medium carbonation. overall nothing to complain about. big and bouncy boozy beer. good shyt..
1331,The Mad Elf,3.86,333 ml bottle freshest by 07/10/2023 consumed on: 08 march 2023 glass: troegs 0.4 l tulip abv: 11%  look: clear amber with bubbles continuously rising. a 1-finger hight beige/light tan head quickly dissolves to a ring and filmy cover leaving ok lacing.  aroma: fruity sweet and a touch spicy. tons of cherries with honey and candi sugar. a light note of cinnamon with a hint of cloves and some baking spices.  taste: what is in the aroma is here. the sweet cherries and the candi sugar are more pronounced. the cinnamon and other spices are quite a bit sharper. the sip dries slightly and does not get cloying but it is certainly sweet and spicy. the alcohol is not hidden and provides a noticeable boozy note.  feel: sharp but also syrupy. warm to hot from the alcohol. the body is medium-light.  overall: this is not my favorite bdsa nor my favorite troegs offering but this makes a decent winter warmer. if you like sweet fruity and boozy beers this one is for you.  my ratings reflect this beer as holiday beer or a winter warmer (which is what mad elf really is). i would rate this much lower as the bsda that it is currently listed as.
1332,The Mad Elf,3.89,i didnt like it as much as a i thought i would but it was still pretty good.
1333,The Mad Elf,4.04,(freshest by 07/15/2023); pours an opaque reddish copper into a samuel smith imperial pint glass with a thin tannish head that fizzes and dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. malts & cherry forward in the nose with a nice sweet earthy aroma to boot. taste follows nose with a tart velvety finish. very slight carbonation with the spicy belgian yeast mid tongue a syrupy mouth and noticeable alcohol burn but hey @ 11% abv its hard to hide. this has been a staple in my beer fridge around the holidays for many moons. always enjoy kicking back with a couple of these on cold winter nights.
1334,The Mad Elf,3.9,1/14/23 poured from 12oz bottle purchased from troegs gift shop.  color is a beautiful reddish copper.  aroma: cherry raisin malt honey. dave can pick out the belgian yeast!  bright effervescence and smooth silkiness in the mouth  taste is tart cherry malt clove and it\s boozy almost hotwith alcohol. slight metallic finish on the sides of the mouth.  not our favorite but its decent. enjoy the mix they have on tap if the grand cacoa and mad elf.
1335,The Mad Elf,5,awesome my favorite.
1336,The Mad Elf,3.54,well this was something else. i feel like this is like when you read the recommended dosage on cold meds and say yeah but im really sick and take more. then it knocks you out. same thing here. it says its full of cherries and you say well yeah its probably a little tart but its a belgian dark strong ale so giddy up. then it knocks you out with tart cherries and that 11%.
1337,Interlude,4.22,bottled april 2022  yet another bottle i grabbed when me and my buddy did the cellar tour there last month. on paper red wine barrel aging and mixed fermentation is everything i want in a saison but this is a style for me that needs to do a lot to impress me. that being said i trust allagash to deliver though so i’m excited to try it  pours a slightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  there’s really not too much funk in the nose but the earthy vibe is still keeping me intrigued. i’m picking up on aromas of bready malt tannic red wine wildflower honey stone wet hay lemon yogurt light earthy hops and pear skin  it’s sharper up front in taste which i appreciate but returns to the yeasty vibe on the back end. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting tart red grape lemon juice doughy malt earthy wheat sharp oak honey tart plum and pear skin. the swallow brings notes of earthy wheat wildflower honey lemon yogurt stone wet hay bready malt and tannic red wine  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a tannic and beer. finishes dry with a great balance  this is really solid stuff. it’s not quite as funky as i prefer for the stylr but it’s close. plus for what it is allagash killed it
1338,Interlude,4.6,3000th beer rating on ba!!!!!!!!  2012 bottle 9.5% cork and cage 750 ml bottle drank out of a bulbous wine glass on 12/23/21. just spectacular!
1339,Interlude,4.46,2016 vintage
1340,Interlude,3.91,shared 750(?) ml corked bottle at local tasting vintage 2007 bought at ølbutikken or høkeren copenhagen may 2011. ale aged in oak barrels abv is 9.5%. clear orange colour moderate white head. aroma of brettanomyces sour fruits and apple cider vinegar. medium sour flavour brettanomyces galore woody finish decent hops. interesting and unusual.
1341,Interlude,3.39,what is this a double saison? 10.4% and a 4.24 average this outta be interesting.  pours a darker color than almost any saison guessing this took some barrel notes with it to the extent that it literally turned the saison beer darker. or maybe its just a maltyboi. or both. anyways its this mixture of dark amber and brown. not much for head retention maybe 1/4 white at its peak but really settles a lot less than that. the aroma had more of a belgian quad than it did saison vibe. but there was a bit of fruitcake like breadiness in the nose seems this one has an ample amount of brett character/nose.  taste brings all the dark fruit in the world into a beer with no dark fruit no doubt the wine barrel brings a lot of that but also this belgian yeast that doesnt seem like a saison yeast at all (more qua bspa or bdsa). mouth feel has a grip load of alcohol heat to it not something i want in a saison. but this isnt much of a saison its more like a wine barrel aged quad. not sure i really get this saison.
1342,Interlude,4.46,2017 vintage. poured from a corkncage bomber into a dogfish head tulip  l: cloudy pour... brown/amber color (looks like apple cider) with thin fizzy/barely there head. modest ring of lacing.  s: tart and fruity. red wine and the cellar its stored in.  t.f: modestly tart... red wine and oak grape must funk and plum. dark fruits... leather baking cherry and black pepper. medium bodied... light carbonation and sticky on the tongue. complex... more red wine and fruit to finish.  o: an absolutely fantastic red-wine barrel aged brew. great complexity and flavor... easy drinking despite some tartness and brett. outstanding.
1343,Interlude,4.6,bottled on 07/27/16  notes of funky red wine oak barrel mild leather slight acetic vinegar barnyard farmhouse hay straw spice toasted bready malts graham cracker caramel toffee vanilla dried fruit tart apple pear apricot cherry plum pineapple with floral earthy herbal hops
1344,Black Butte XXXV,3.86,pours an effervescent mahogany with a pinky of mocha colored head. average-ish head retention & lacing  s: cocoa roastyness & some cherries nose stays strong  t: follows the nose barrel dryness a touch of carob & some leafy hops up front. cocoa cherry & a little roastyness/ dryness as this beer warms up plus some woody hops. finishes pretty dry with woody & leafy hops plus a little cherry & cocoa  mf: medium body slight carbonation warming got chewier as it warmed up  solid not great ba tale on this style. rare that i dig many beers of this style if cherries are featured this is no exception. serviceable not memorable
1345,Black Butte XXXV,3.91,many thx to muchloveforhops3 for this bottle!  a - dark brown pour with a dense layer of creamy toffee colored foam.  s - cocoa cherry and vanilla.  t - nice cocoa malt base with cherries and light vanilla blended in.  m - big medium soft body that finishes uber wet with warming in the back of the throat.  o - deschutes - skip the adjuncts and put this solid base beer in an interesting barrel.
1346,Black Butte XXXV,4.12,bottle pour- dark as can be with short chocolate milk head leaving frosty lacing. nose is roasty malt with hints of cherry and vanilla. taste follows with some cocoa notes barrel wood and a bit of alcohol that lingers on the dryish finish. a bit milder than expected.
1347,Black Butte XXXV,4.48,from a bottle packaged on 06/07/23  nice hiss upon opening with a bit of smoke coming out of the bottle. this beer pours pitch black and even when i hold it up to light nothing comes through. the head is thick at 3 fingers and extremely long lasting. how can the head last this long in an 11% imperial porter? once it finally dissipates it leaves a nice bit of lacing on the glass. the aroma is quite powerful. i get tons of caramel chocolate molasses coffee plum raisin vanilla and cherry. these aromas are well balanced and work very well together. wow the flavor the cherries start it off and linger throughout. they fade a bit as the rest of the crew comes into play. lots of chocolate caramel dark fruit molasses coffee all work their way into the party. the finish is where the vanilla shines as it works with the cherries. theres a tartness from the cherries that cuts into the sweetness that this style can have. it provides a nice counter balance. thick and full bodied overall not imperial stout levels but very full for a porter. getting the faintest hint of heat from the alcohol. smooth feeling. overall this is an astounding beer in a good way. quite happy and impressed with it.
1348,Black Butte XXXV,4.35,from the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. this solid little brew pours a muddled coal black with a thick head of brown foam that sizzles to a thick ring thin clumping layer and sports some very nice lacing. nose of dark coffee tart cherry dark bakers chocolate char and faint bourbon. flavors surpass the nose with earthy dark chocolate bourbon vanilla oak char toasted coconut tart cherry and heavy dark coffee. mouth feel is full smooth coating medium light carbonation lightly warming and a bitter malt / coffee / dark chocolate finish that is moderately dry.  overall a solid little imperial  cheers
1349,Black Butte XXXV,4.25,in thirty-five years of playing with porter imagination and creativity run amuck as elements of cherry cocoa and vanilla add tangy balance and curiosity to its imperial toasted dark ale of succulence.  just the slimmest shade off from black its near-onyx body is capped with a tan whipped mocha froth that sturdily holds onto the glass during the patient session. with strong coffee cocoa and burnt toast hovering above the rim its tangy dark fruit scent is highlighted by its tingle of bourbon spice. its full and deeply penetrating taste is of wonderfully burnt sugars leading with molasses bakers chocolate and latte early on the palate.  with earthen elements of coffee soil smoldering embers and burnt bread seeping into the mouth; the brilliant vibrancy of cherry seem to bounce off the tongue with its mild acidic balance. soothing with vanilla and lingering caramelization the taste eventually turns coffee bitter with smoldering embers booze soaked oak and nuances of toasted coconut.  bittered with coffee and campfire a burnt pinecone taste pulls from the ash and achieves a slight semblance of dryness with spicy bourbon into a finish that echoes chocolate covered cherries in long waves of aftertaste.
1350,Black Butte XXXV,3.91,cherry cola beer
1351,Black Butte XXXV,3.5,12oz bottle from boise co-op. near black pour slight beige head. chocolaty aroma light roast. taste walks a fine line between chocolate and roasty malts. pretty mild for an 11% abv.
1352,Black Butte XXXV,4.25,a surprise find at the bottle shop had no idea this seasonal was released yet. 12oz bottle poured into a goblet.  pours pitch-black and stout dark with a mocha-colored cap of head about a fingers worth. the nose is earthy and dark with notes of that cocoa oak whiskey tobacco char smoke and dark fruits. the cherry only emerges on the finish to me and isnt distracting at all more of a hidden nuance than an overt addition. there is an impression of booze that blends with the oaky vanilla and earthy wet tobacco leaf with that cocoa present but never in a sweet confectionary way...nice hints of smoke and char too...drying and bitter at times but that keeps the palate moving in an appropriate way.  overall i enjoyed it and would drink it again a fine example of a porter.
1353,Zombie Ice,4.41,fantastic pine-y hoppy smell. i taste some tropical fruity flavors like pineapple and guava with more sweetness than zombie dust. more malt and more sweetness make this well-balanced. the bitterness lingers with astringency. a little more syrupy than i would like the mouthfeel. its really quite good. if they werent nearly $20 (including tax) for 4 at meijer this might be a regular drink for me.
1354,Zombie Ice,3.81,copper colored with a half inch of creamy beige on top. lightly soapy lacing. i’m smelling melon pine and alcohol. i’m tasting melon pine and alcohol. the mouth moderately carbonated and a touch boozy.
1355,Zombie Ice,4.26,semi-hazy copper amber appearance with a soapy white head decent retention and lacing. pineapple pear pine malt alcohol well hidden. medium body moderate carbonation creamy mouthfeel.
1356,Zombie Ice,4.13,extra large (19.2 oz) and fairly fresh can with a june 2023 canning date stamped on the bottom. served in a .6l beer glass.  appearance. deep amber colored clear body. it is topped with a modest size white head that has good retention and leaves plentiful lacing on the glass.  this is an imperial pale ale were that a category given the 8.5% abv. the high abv however is well hidden being most evident in the mouthfeel. moreover the flavor has about average bitterness with a strength that seems just a bit higher than average. fruity aroma with clean well balanced flavor. the best beer i\ve ever had with ice in its name.
1357,Zombie Ice,4.45,on tap at blackback pub in waterbury vt.  this one pours a rusted orange-ish color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells like orange piney hops lightly sweet malt marijuana and grapefruit.  this isn’t as good as zombie dust – that’s an all-time classic. but it’s still cool to see an amped-up version of it. it’s lightly malty but not as much as you’d expect. it’s very orange-y with lots of grapefruit with marijuana and clean piney bitterness.  this is medium bodied clean with a smooth bitterness on the back end and very drinkable.  i still really enjoy the old school ipa stylings from three floyds.
1358,Zombie Ice,4.25,16 oz on tap at art and craft beer ny. loved it. maybe even better than zombie dust a bit more balanced and malty but just as crisp and easy to drink. a little dank citrus pine refreshing. good price too.
1359,Zombie Ice,4.33,hazy orangey yellow body with a full white head and ring of lacing. caramel malt base with resinous pine hops orange and grapefruit nose. taste is more fruity with apricot and slight pineapple added to the huge citra hop notes grapefruit king amongst the fruits pine and resin snaps the finish. great balance. so smooth and resinous with a bittering finish full yet medium bodied. this is better than normal zombie dust i said it!
1360,Zombie Ice,4.66,what the heck? if you love zombie dust youll love this!! crisp and clean and no caffeine! 3 floyds makes outstanding brewskis so no surprise here. im a huge double ipa fan and this one goes down smooth as silk. my kind of lawnmower beer! cheers!
1361,Zombie Ice,4.23,12oz can poured into a snifter  a- pours a hazy dull orange color with a one-finger foamy white head that quickly reduces to a think ring around the glass  s- citrus-forward hop nose with zesty grapefruit leading the way along with some piney notes. biscuity undertone  t- tangerine and zesty grapefruit up front followed by some pine resin. mid-palate gives some malty bready notes. the finish gives more zesty citrus which sticks around on the linger  m- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into the finish
1362,Zombie Ice,4.29,appearance: pours a slightly hazy amber color with a sturdy two finger head; strong retention and shards of lacing  smell: orange and orange pith aromatics; dank with biscuit and pine tones complementing  taste: the biscuity malts complement the orange pith hops from the outset with the hops presenting a stronger force through the middle; some melon peeks through but the bitter finish dominates all  mouthfeel: medium to full body with moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet  overall: true to what you would expect from the floyd brothers this is a solid throwback to the days when bitterness was what hopheads were seeking
1363,Zombie Ice,4.03,poours an effervescent light amber with a thumb+ pf cream colored head. very good head retention & solid lacing  s: some citrus a little breadyness some cattyness once warm  t: grapefruit grassyness lime & dryness up front a touch of caramel & pine up front. more pineyness leafy hops dryness & a little bit of grassy hop once this beer warms up. finishes piney dry with some cakeyness  mf: medium body restrained carbonation nicely balanced  nice old school hop bomb very drinkable
1364,Quilmes,3.13,11.5 oz bottle enjoy by date 3/14/24 into a tulip glass. l: pours clear rich golden caramel with a thin fizzy off white head low head retention minimal lacing. s: a hint of bread lightly floral background lighter fruits pastry dough. t: gently sweet dirty grains grassy hops very light fruit notes a hint of fruit zest and the back end of the finish and has a very light aftertaste of white grape. f: average thin and medium-light bodied feel with a lightly assertive center and a fast drying finish. o: european in style and slightly dry. drinks easily and is gently sweet. good balance and brewery touts natural ingredients. its okay in its style.
1365,Quilmes,3.05,bottle pour into a tulip glass. clear golden appearance with a modest soapy head that recedes quickly to a surface film and collar. celery pepper metallic notes. light body light carbonation.
1366,Quilmes,3.52,340ml bottle best before 11/05/23 so either 6 months from now or two weeks ago... the beer pours bright light golden amber with off white head. the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and island. no lacing. the aroma is mild with sweet grain. the taste is semisweet pale malt with a hint of corny / vegetable flavor. moderate bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with just above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. overall good.
1367,Quilmes,2.8,fizzy kinda sweet and malty whiz but when sitting at an argentinian restaurant with a plate full of ‘comida’ it somehow works. nothing i’d put a sixer in the fridge of though..
1368,Quilmes,2.12,messi recommended it so..... blecch..... is it so difficult to steal one of our brewerys recipes and produce it? they have all our military information... decent carbonation though.
1369,Quilmes,2.57,sep. 2011: 330 ml bottle as quilmes cerveza from super cor la manga (spain). abv is 4.9%. pale yellow colour pearly carbonation low and short-lived head. sweetish aroma notes of maize grass and citrus. tolerably fresh flavour notes of citrus. an okay refreshment on a hot day nothing more.
1370,Quilmes,1.95,very standard cheap beer.
1371,Curiosity Thirty Two,4.33,canned on 7/5/23; consumed on 8/12/23  pours an opaque sunflower-orange hue capped with two fingers of creamy eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a finger of frothy cap and dense collar while a generous spattering of spotty lacing coats the walls of the glass.  aromas of ripe mango are accented with guava zest and pineapple husk with orange oils informing a peppery dank as a creamy floral build settles through the bouquet.  taste brings mango bubblegum into notes of orange and mango as white pepper stimulates an earthier aspect of peach zest over the mid-palate and orange tang invigorates the close.  mouthfeel shows a medium body and a moderate spritz of carbonation levying a subdued bog to a drying prickle past the mid-palate toward a back end both subliminally resinous and coyly juicy.  an initially tropical amalgam explores myriad hop subtext in a turn toward swampy earthy rinds before reinvigorating a brighter cleaner base; a sampling of the tree house ipa profile at its most comprehensive form.
1372,Curiosity Thirty Two,4.63,from a 16oz can dated 7/5/23 into a 20oz pint glass. can message: welcome back old friend  pours a thick opaque pale yellowish orange with about one finger of white head. several minutes in and half of the head is still present. tons of lacing.  decently strong aromas of orange grape tangerine and a touch of lemon zest.  taste follows. has a sweet white wine vibe going on. citrus and hint of lemon. nice earthy bitterness on the back of the sip.  full-bodied thick soft mouthfeel. slight dry stickiness on the swallow. lingering bitter aftertaste. low to medium carbonation.  man this is a fabulous brew. loving every sip.
1373,Curiosity Thirty Two,4.63,from a two-week-old can stamped hello old friend pours a glowing greenish gold. smell and taste feature citrus white grape and earthy spicy herbs. an amazing beer an outstanding melding of citra and nelson.
1374,Houblon Chouffe,4.81,was getting weary of ipas. this one breaks the mold. fresh clean not overly bitter. great flavor.
1375,Houblon Chouffe,4.44,oof. this chouffe packs a punch. pours a golden amber big soapy head. decent carbonation with a fullish feel. hints of wood and fruity florals on the nose follows with hoppy goodness botanicals as promised and possible citrus zest in the aftertaste. complex and delicious. love belgian blonds but this is converting me to ipas!
1376,Houblon Chouffe,4.86,reviewing again because i am bored in this shit country that is not ukraine.  this for me is probably the best beer ever that is commercilly available.  i spend a lot of time drinking beer. the belgians know how to brew. and the americans know how to add hops. this is a perfection of both and commerciallly available definitely unlike carlsberg one of the best beers in the world.
1377,Houblon Chouffe,4.35,11.2 oz bottle fridge cool into a ‘can glass’. gold haze raises up a fantastic foam. spider web lacing throughout the experience. aroma is sweet belgian yeast with quality piney hops and plenty of botanicals. little banana deep dive to clove a surprisingly nice bit of funk. taste is of a well made belgian tripel with a blast of hops and all that goes with that description. finishes slightly sweet and punctuates with a dry and bitter note. medium mouth. generous carbonation. this effort stands above other breweries doing the style (cigar city’s cosmic crown coppertail unholy for example) and is a well crafted recipe.
1378,Houblon Chouffe,4.75,i had this on draft 3/6/23 @ the hopleaf.  opaque orange appearance.  big off-white head; strong lacing.  peach wheat strawberry & orange peel notes in the nose. fruity bliss!  soft medium mouthfeel. peach strawberry soft wheat & faint orange peel flavors.  a soft citrus-y delight. delicious!
1379,Houblon Chouffe,4.53,an outstanding belgian ipa: a great marriage of flavors and i like the pine aroma and flavor associated with west coast ipas. excellent body and long finish. sublime.
1380,Houblon Chouffe,4.06,for a belgian take on an ipa this is pretty interesting. like a hopped up blonde ale - a nice change of pace from my american ipas.
1381,Houblon Chouffe,4.53,poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. clear golden color with a thick white head and orange highlights. excellent head retention with gorgeous sheets of lacing as it receded. aromas and flavors of rose petals up front (!) followed by notes of herbal hops and orange. unmistakable umami character with a dry and bitter finish. an excellent beer that drinks well below its 9% abv.
1382,Devil Dancer,4.76,drinking this triple ipa with my boys keith and greg on the patio on a hot summer night in dallas brings back great memories. so dank and so dirty. like the pine tar from george brett’s bat mixed with the sweat from a neanderthal woman. physically and psychologically one of my favorite dirty bird beers ever. i love you founders.
1383,Devil Dancer,3.96,12oz bottle courtesy of whyteboar. according to the stamp on the rear label this was bottled on january 16 2020. perhaps not ideal for a normal ipa but as the same rear label makes clear this aint no normal ipa as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv!  poured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (dont know what else to call it) this was a dark amber color taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. about an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer.  nose was of herbal grassy hops bready malts plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. as it warms it gets a bit boozy.  more promising in the flavor department than in the nose. grapefruity piney peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. quite a bit of alcohol heat is present. unsurprisingly for a triple ipa from the midwest there\s a massive malt backbone so for the hops to stand out as much as they do there must have been an ungodly amount used.  medium to full body with a coating resiny almost syrupy mouthfeel.  this is a beast! i imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make and get why its not widely distributed at this point. enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home and thats probably for the best! thank you for getting this to me craig! its one ive long been wanting to try!
1384,ApriHop,2.38,the hops drown out any apricot flavor this stuff is horrible.
1385,ApriHop,4.71,one of my favorite beers ever the dark almost caramel flavor of the apricot is a much better compliment to the ipa style that you might think. a perfectly balanced beer and a great pickup if you can find it.
1386,Grey Monday,4.31,2021 vintage  i’m an absolute sucker for hazelnuts in a stout and when i see that the bruery has one it’s an instant buy. plus it’s also another top 250 list tick. this is a big ass bottle that i’ll likely be attacking all night so let’s stop wasting time and get right into it  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  right off the jump there isn’t much hazelnut present in the nose but it’s still interesting nonetheless. i’m picking up on aromas of molasses earthy bourbon peat smoke sea salt cocoa powder toasted hazelnut dry oak light vanilla and raisin  the hazelnuts definitely express a bit more in taste though they still aren’t exactly at the forefront. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting cocoa powder earthy bourbon toasted hazelnut toasted oak black cherry burnt caramel vanilla sea salt and smoky tobacco. the swallow brings notes of dark chocolate earthy bourbon toasted hazelnut sea salt peat smoke sea salt molasses dry oak burnt caramel and light vanilla  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick beer. finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv. like literally less than half and that’s easily the most impressive part of this one  i struggle with this one. it’s definitely not top 250 material and the adjunct isn’t really the star but on the other hand it’s (dangerously) drinkable and pretty unique. worth a shot for sure
1387,Grey Monday,4.2,750ml bottle 2021 edition sent to new society members under their new nationwide shipping policy. very little difference from the base black tuesday if im honest having had regular bt many times but this being my first grey monday. that means its excellent but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point (if it was ever more prominent) yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness. its not nutella thats for sure. it also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard bt being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultra-high abv and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit.
1388,Grey Monday,3.76,pours a very dark brown though with moderate light clarity on the edges. fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum molasses dark soy sauce barley oyster sauce and vanilla. flavor is a little tough to place. heat - both warming booze and sharp ethanol - pop right away. there\s significant salinity that\s different from black tuesday - less deep blackstrap molasses more brackish sea spray or even oysters. malts soy sauce black licorice are there but with less intensity than bt. the nuts come forward as it warms and though it\s hard to definitively place hazelnuts they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts - definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut. mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer (i\d call it moderate) especially when compared to bt or a bcbs. that\s not bad per se but i think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness. this was interesting - though i\m not sure i\d be keen to shell out for another bottle.
1389,Grey Monday,4.47,750 ml bottle bottled 05/31/19 19.2% abv. served in a snifter the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that didnt stay around for too long. not much lacing either. i like the aroma the brew smells like bourbon vanilla fudge hazelnuts brown sugar and roasted malt. taste is similar to the aroma but theres the addition of some burnt/charred malt caramel and earthy/oaky flavors. its a little more roasty/bitter tasting than i was expecting but thats not a complaint by any means. all the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. mouthfeel/body is full its slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. and as with most of the bruerys big beers its not as boozy as youd expect it to be. i thought this was a good overall imperial stout definitely worth trying if you get the chance!
1390,Grey Monday,4.44,2013 and drank in 2022 look - black thick syrup smell - boozy maple barrel and hazelnut taste - boozy maple hazelnut barrel feel - medium full body slight syrup very light carb overall - tasty
1391,Grey Monday,4,2018 vintage the beer pours very little head and the beer itself is a dark brown color with a bourbon like appearance.  the smell is good. it has a nice mix of a sweet alcohol note and sweet hazelnut.  the taste still has the hazelnut note but the chocolate is more forward and dominates the taste alongside the alcohol note.  the feel is good. it has a heavy body with very little carbonation and a slight burn at the end.  overall a good beer worth getting and drinking fresh instead of holding it for a while.
1392,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.33,may 2011: 355 ml bottle from voldby købmandsgård denmark. i felt compelled to sample this beer - brazil is such a big country and i was kind of shameful for not having sampled any of their beers previously ... abv is 4.5%. very pale yellow colour moderate white head. sweetish sugary and grainy aroma hints of maize - but not awful. bland and dusty flavour fairly dry and thus kind of refreshing when ice cold but the bitterness is very low and there are hardly any flavour elements worth mentioning. utterly forgettable. for the sake of brazilian beer entusiasts if they exist: i do hope you have access to better beers than this!
1393,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.29,not very complex but simple good flavor and easy drinking. good beer for a hot day.
1394,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.45,12oz bottle coded j048 1543 poured into a pilsner glass at fridge temp 4.7% abv per label. the beer pours bright light straw yellow with off white head. the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. the aroma is faint with light malt grain and very slight lager yeast. the taste is grainy malt with a touch of sour a tiny bit of grassy hops ending with a mildly bitter (barely vegetable) finish. the mouthfeel is thin bodied highly carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. no glaring off flavors or flaws. overall ok as a german pilsner. it would be very good as an aal but im not sure there are any brewing adjuncts used in the production. tastes like maybe all 2-row barley. this beer was actually bottled by cervejas premium do brazil st. john nb canada and imported by www.eurobrews.com.
1395,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.89,this beer is better than your average macro brew. cheers! c
1396,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.16,l: clear honey gold color with almost no head or lacing.  s:. toasted cracker malt notes of apple and some slightly skunky hops and corn.  t:. sweet apple some corn and a little malt. tastes a little watery. not much flavor.  f: light body and clean with higher carbonation  o: this is your typical tropical beach lager light without much flavor.
1397,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.51,im really digging this wild palm...nice drinkability with a full bodied finish. pretty decent for a light brew.
1398,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.15,pint can into a mug;. clear pale straw color with a small white head that quickly faded to a thin film. toasty malt and cracker aroma with a hint of honey and melon. bready malt flavor with some mildly astringent hop bitterness. extremely well-balanced smooth and very drinkable; i can certainly envision myself slamming one too many of these at a fest.
1399,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,3.92,pours a clear light golden color with a nice head and lacing aroma has hop hints the taste follows the nose with a well balanced hop flavor a light bodied decently carbonated beer a good festbier
1400,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,3.85,11.2 oz bottle poured hard into a boston lager glass. the head looked nice but didn’t last at all but otherwise it looks nice. unfortunately the scent just isn’t strong enough once the head dissipates. the flavor though makes up for it. light malts but they’re definitely the backbone. very little bitterness but the hops add nice floral notes. they work well together here. highly carbonated but i’d appreciate a little more body overall. a nice beer for this time of year though i hope to try the marzen soon.
1401,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.07,was interested in how the festbier compared to the marzen. honestly i might prefer this one.  crystal clear and highly carbonated though not quite as much as a pilsner. otherwise is very similar in shade maybe just a touch darker. smell is honeyed malt sweetness crackery pilsner and a slight hop floral note. taste offers a surprising amount of fruit. hint of banana at the beginning but it quickly overcome by a wine or cider-like dry fruitiness. pears apples and grapes. breadiness is here on the back of the palate but it is not the primary note. there is very little toastiness to speak of (perhaps a tiny bit) and id say thats the main difference between this and marzen. mouthfeel has the carbonation battling the thickness from higher alcohol. a bit undecided (is this supposed to be a heavy or crushable drink?) but not bad. the dry aspect is what really makes it easy to drink but i cant help but think id be sick of it by two anyways. i guess in a sense it needs to cater to both crowds (people who want a strong drink vs people who want a session) if its the only thing being served at an oktoberfest though.  kind of like an imperial helles. overall i think i like it about as much as a good marzen but this style fits the warmer early autumn weather a lot better. ill take my marzen after october.
1402,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,3.97,the german version with a label best by date of 03.2024. picked up at a local grocery store while buying food for the week. a bunch of festbiers have hit the shelves so why not. looks smells and tastes like a good helles. not sure the difference. a bit sweeter than most light lagers this is definitely crushable in large mug form.
1403,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.01,surely i would drink gallons in the tent.
1404,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.06,a well-balanced and highly drinkable lager. pours a clear golden yellow has a malty (but not roasted malty) backbone and finishes with a coppery slightly metallic aftertaste that i associate with paulaner. as you might expect it pairs very nicely with the classic salty and savory beer-friendly fare like sausage and pretzel.
1405,Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,4.04,16 ounce can into a pilsner glass. canned 3/21/21 had 9/1/21.  pours a bright clear golden color with a two inch plus foamy head and a good amount of foamy lacing. active carbonation. aromas of malt light caramel some bread light white grapes. smells herbal and somewhat grassy. similar flavors- malt bread light caramel and white grapes. tastes herbal and spicy with a light hop bitterness. smooth a very good light body well carbonated.  not a style i frequent but really like this. nicely balanced between the hops and malt. don’t know if the grapes are my imagination or not but either way it’s a pleasant surprise. very enjoyable.
1406,Oaktoberfest,3.85,oak aging creates a silky mouth feel and a nice complexity of flavor. 5.2% abv so you are safe having more than one. i think this is one fine fest beer for 2023!
1407,Oaktoberfest,4.07,12oz can pours a very light and clear golden-orange-amber color with a small fizz of off-white head that disappears pretty quickly. smells of caramel and bready malts as well as a slight noble hop and wood note. normal märzen flavors of caramel toasted malt slight sweetness and nice noble hops. almost tastes a little boozy which is surprising for 5.2% abv. a subtle but grounding wood note is strong in the background of the flavor and adds a really nice complexity. medium body with a mild carbonation mouthfeel and a small perfectly balanced bitterness. some herbal flavors of the hops and the caramel sweetness form most of the aftertaste for a pleasant but long finish.  the oak barrels really set this apart but its also just an excellent and extremely well-balanced märzen to begin with. delicious and would buy again in a heartbeat.
1408,Oaktoberfest,4.15,oaktoberfest from firestone walker. 12 fl oz bottles from franklin beer franklin pa 09/05/23. $ 10.00 (including tax)/six-pack - $0.139/fl oz. reviewed 15/06/23 (review 3124). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. bottom of label stamped “c7/22/22” on room temperature shelf at store. stored at 34 degrees at home. served at 46.2 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 55.2 degrees f. appearance – 4. first pour – pale gold (srm 4) clear. body – gold (srm 5) slight chill haze. under direct light same. when rear lite same. head: average (maximum 3.9 cm aggressive center pour) baby powder high density quickly diminishing to a 0.8 – 1.0 cm undulating crown with a rocky cap. lacing – none. aroma – 4 – virtually none – just a weak oak aroma. no yeast no hops no malt. no ethanol (5.2 % abv according to the label). flavor – 4.25 – slight oakiness and light caramel malt. no yeast. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. weak gastric warming. palate – 4 – medium; approaching syrupy; soft carbonation. final impression and summation: 4.25 the crispness is a bit lacking but the oakiness helps. better than the average märzen because it is slightly less sweet and better than the average lager because the oak ameliorates the hop flavor a bit. some lacing would have raised the score slightly.
1409,Oaktoberfest,4.12,clear light-amber with one finger of off-white head.  smell is the usual combination of toffee and caramel but lighter than is typical. slight spicy aroma plus some hints of oak that seemed slightly vinous when first opened. not apparent after the head fades.  taste is similar to aroma with light spiciness and a hint of fruitiness. lightly-bitter finish.  feel is light-medium with moderate veryvery fine carbonation tingle that bites in the back of the throat at finish.  overall lighter and more subtle than a typical marzen. this is the last bottle of four and the best and have rated it as-is without regard to the fresher specimens. the first couple seemed a bit too subtle and bland. either this is a better tasting night or it has become a little more complex over the last 2 (3?) month. if you see any stragglers still out there id recommend giving them a try.
1410,Oaktoberfest,4.15,super mellow. neat generous head. a fine subtle brew this is.
1411,Oaktoberfest,3.78,l: pours a orange amberish color with a medium white head and no lacing on the glass.  s: fresh toasted bread notes of caramel a toasted oakfinished by malty sweetness.  t: toasted bread notes of caramel some toasted oak and finishes with a malty sweetness a very pleasant oktoberfest.  f: carb is a little lower than expectedmedium body.  o: a solid oktoberfest
1412,Oaktoberfest,3.79,pours a clear golden amber 1 off white head that quickly recedes to a thick coaster light lacing. nose is grassy hop honey pale toffee. taste is balanced with enough hop spice and bitterness to balance the sweeter malt. mouthfeel is crisp and helps keep it sessionable. still want a bit more malt character and evolution.
1413,Oaktoberfest,3.73,12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug.  l: amber one inch persistent white head some lace. s: light bread oak spicy and herbal hops. t: toasty herbal hops some oak finishes with a woody tang more acidic than a normal marzen. f: m-l body medium carb crisp with an underlying softness. o: not bad but not as good as a more traditional marzen.
1414,Oaktoberfest,4,poured out a golden color with a white head. the smell is of hops bread and something sweet. the flavor is very good and what you expect in an oktoberfest beer. i will be definitely drinking a few more of them in my future.
1415,The Rusty Nail,4.46,poured from 22oz waxed bomber into a tulip. this is the 2023 vintage release; this version is 14.1%. i had this beer ages ago when it first came out but im just getting around to reviewing it now!  appearance: dark as a moonless night with a starless sky. impenetrable. head is a thin layer of tan foam; that could be a little nicer.  smell: cinnamon right up front but with enough vanilla from the bourbon and a dash of licorice to really give the feeling of a sweet bread. i mean this thing is as sweet as summer days are long but the overall vibe is great big hug from a panadería and i am very much into it  taste: sweet of course but with a very bakery-like sensibility as in the aroma. the licorice and alcohol give the otherwise sweet cinnamon-roll flavor a more mature dimension. i really love the complexity of flavor and juxtaposition of elements here. its diabetes in a bottle but hey i dont really need these feet!  mouthfeel: rich body with a good carbonation and a smooth satisfying creaminess. maybe not perfectly silky but damn fine.  overall: the drinkability for a 14.1% ba stout is truly astounding. this beer is a sugar bomb; im really going to have some explaining to do after my next a1c evaluation. however that doesnt mean this beer isnt goo-ooo-ood.
1416,The Rusty Nail,4.11,yet another time to be alive pour this one also came during the tap takeover for beernv right before the alabama show at lake tahoe. this was the 2022 version.  pours black. even though its the same color as a stout i expected greater viscosity. didn\t amass much of a head. some brown cherry cola like head but it was thin 1/6. blew a hole down the middle. the aroma didn\t yield much in the way of roasted malt it put a much heavier influence on the barrel(s). sweet bourbon and/or whiskey notes dominate.  the taste gets a little more complex perhaps its the stuff i loathe like licorice or cinnamon bark actually making a yield that is more enjoyable than the sum of its parts. the mouth feel isnt hot or bitter like i was expecting its a real smooth showcase for a pretty big beer but it doesnt have that challenging edge that extreme advocate seems to desire.  its a pretty nice big beer and i dont like big beers that much lately.
1417,The Rusty Nail,4.48,i haven’t had a tetanus shot in a while and the nail might be rusty but i’m still going for it. like hemet kumar lying on a bed of them to get his chill on i am straight feeling this. it’s balanced and nasty at the same time. and i’m talking good “nasty” to you needs out there.  anyway life was meant to be had. let’s go.
1418,The Rusty Nail,4.28,poured from a 2022 twenty two ounce bottle with neither head nor lacing and little carbonation. starless and bible black in color.  the nose features the barrel and a wee bit of malty char. pleasant but unremarkable.  the taste reveals the licorice and cinnamon bark. they pair nicely and do not dominate as i feared. im wary of cinnamon in beer but the deft hand of the brewers keeps things in harmony.  mouthfeel is luxurious and finish is barrel. not too hot but the booze is felt. there’s enough carbonation to satisfy.
1419,The Rusty Nail,4.7,poured into a snifter - dark black pour not quite jet black but very dark. lite lacing appearing. getting aromas of malts cinnamon chocolate molasses bourbon. tastes follow the nose with a very rich sweetness behind this. burnt brown sugar cinnamon chocolate licorice dark fruits such as cherries figs apricots slight coffee and bourbon. feel is medium to medium heavy. not to thick/ oily. very good feel. sipper very easy sipper. overall this is a very great beer and i can see why its ranked number one on here. easily the best oatmeal barrel aged stout ive had. cheers.
1420,The Rusty Nail,4,2017 vintage bottle consumed on 2/4/23 at a bottle share. held up quite well; drank velvety smooth and had good flavours of which cinnamon was picked up the most with light licorice notes.
1421,The Rusty Nail,4.44,12/15/2019
1422,The Rusty Nail,4.88,look: black with the thinnest of brown heads. very viscous  smell: barrel chocolate malty dark fruit  taste: follows the nose chocolate and fruit on the front followed by malt and barrel  feel: super viscous with just a hint of carbonation
1423,The Rusty Nail,4.6,looks as youd expect dark & opaque. little carbonation or head. nose is complex with licorice cocoa cinnamon & a smokey note. taste follows nose with cherries added & a wee bit of bourbon barrel. mouthfeel is thick due to smoked barley & oats. luscious really. cherries are quite bright in the finish a very well balanced stout.
1424,The Rusty Nail,4.56,pours ink black and no discerning head. chocolate pastryspice smooth chocolate and cinnamon and also licorice. medium feel and smooth long finish. flavors work wonderfully together at 55 deg. and while warming up.
1425,The Rusty Nail,4.53,2022 edition - 13.6% abv - poured from a 22oz waxed bomber into a snifter.  seal brown body with a rouse-able dun/desert sand event horizon; good retention for whats there; fine sandy lacing sticky thin tears.  cocoa molasses cinnamon baked oatmeal sugar (demerara with hints of muscovado) tobacco vanilla and coconut in the nose. sweet complex and balanced.  the flavor follows the nose but is joined by a wave of chocolate covered cherries plum torte cloves faint poblano sweet hay and more. malty and rich with hints of toasted nuts and smores in addition to black licorice and cinnamon. medium earthy finish with the base beer shining through like the best oatmeal cookie youve had. hints of ceylon tea at times. low bitterness throughout. flavors are not quite integrated - curious how this would age.  slick oily full-bodied mouthfeel low tannins and lush carbonation. well hidden abv.  for me this falls just a little short of perfection with the emphasis on spices and a finish that is just a tiny bit too sweet.
1426,Stargazer,3.68,poured into a wide mouth grip shaped goblet: color is straw gold murky haziness head presents 1 finger thick head then dissipates to thin top and ring on glass sides.  smell is mixed tropicals citrus typical nt offering light maltiness with bread and wheat notes.  taste is sweet light candied notes tropical fruit with pineapple forward some citrus some berry light maltiness and notes of bread/biscuit a little thicker/sweeter than broken heels.  mouthfeel is low carbonation moderate/strong sweetness low bitterness lingering sweet-bitterness.  overall a sweeter slightly cloying broken heels.
1427,Stargazer,4.13,one fingers worth of crisp bone white colored froth... respectable retention... color is a hazed lemony yellow... light pineapple and hay on the nose... perhaps a bit of orange zest as well... palate is largely as expected but notes of stone fruit add a lot of great depth and complexity... on the fuller side of medium bodied and ultra lush with just the slightest bit of carbonation... goes down smoothly sip after sip... very nice textbook beer from new trail that is sulquarely in their wheelhouse... good stuff...
1428,Stargazer,3.99,undated can into pint glass. pours a murky medium gold with a brief off-white head. minimal lacing. initial impression is pineapple mango and tropical fruits. mouthfeel is smooth and medium thick. finish fades to citrus. overall an ok but not notable neipa.
1429,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,3.62,purchaed at the athens oh brewery in june 2023. poured at 56°. thin layer of rocky tan bubbles which vanished quickly leaving no cap retention ring nor lace; no legs; black with ruby edges. spicy nose followed by chocolate and a bit of bourbon; hot spicy/boozy (13.7%) retro nasal. spicy hot green chilies sauce entry; black pepper; chocolate (oreo cookies come to mind); bourbon; cinnamon as beer warms; minimal vanilla; no walnuts from the the base beer. hot mouth warmth from habaneros spices and alcohol; thin watery body; light carbonation. overall unbalanced; my mouth is on fire; it’s so hot the beer burns all the way down my gullet; not enjoyable; i like spicy mexican cake style stouts but this beer is extreme; glad i only bought one.
1430,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,3.88,2023-07-03 375ml bottle served in a little snulip. vintage 2022. got it from @ozzylizard in nbs bif #17.  pours black with no head looks still. smell is bourbon and vanilla burnt toffee and near-burnt nuts sweet molasses hint of something like cinnamon or nutmeg.  taste is (for me) dominated by cinnamon. nuts are still there and something comes across as milk chocolate. molasses sweetness. i was feeling a little bit of spice on my lips and thinking it was a bit odd for cinnamon to have that much power but not be totally overwhelming for me and then i read on the label that it contains habaneros and thats clearly evident now that i saw it. as its warming up the cinnamon is becoming even more powerful.  mouthfeel is nicely thick and chewy. overall...it appears to be a pretty good stout with a nice level of pepper but too much cinnamon for me.
1431,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,5,i fell in love with this beer from the beauty on the label to the deep dark color to smooth finish. i used to drive all the way to danvers to purchase it at total wine. then covid hit. are you going to brew up a new batch? i would buy an extra large tee shirt of the lovely lady and walk around as free advertising too.
1432,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.3,bourbon barrel oro negro from jackie o’s 12.7 oz bottle. received from brewery 05/04/23. reviewed 10/04/23 (review 3070). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. printed on the label “2022”. stored at 34 degrees at home. served at 54.6 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 59.0 degrees f. appearance – 3.75. first pour – ruby brown (srm 24) almost opaque. body – deep brown (srm 30) opaque. under direct light same. when rear lite shows a translucent olive at the top edge and ruby at the bottom. head – none. while pouring a five mm crescent of large bubbles appears on about a third of the circumference but quickly evaporates. lacing – none. aroma – 4.25 – bourbon and barrel are the predominant aromas no malt no yeast no hops no chocolate. oddly no habaneros. no ethanol (13.7 % abv as marked on the label) aroma. flavor – 4.5 – the habaneros set up a nice oral burn not too hot and lacking any vegetal flavor. cinnamon rides in on the aftertaste. initially no hops malt or yeast; light chocolate and ghostly vanilla. slight gastric warming but that could be from capsaicin as well as ethanol. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. palate – 4 – medium; creamy; soft carbonation. final impression and summation: 4.25 lacking both head and lacing the appearance loses a few points. both the flavor and aroma are quite good with distinct hits of habaneros cinnamon cocoa and even detectable vanilla all supported by the bourbon and barrel. very good and well worth grabbing if you run across a bottle or six. extra points for having a lizard on the label.
1433,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.4,poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle the body is a dark cola brown. small initial head that quickly dissipated and no lacing of consequence.  aroma is a complex mix of bourbon cinnamon vanilla and chile. the habanero aroma is muted but present.  taste follows nose though the barrel is a tad sweeter than the nose. youll need to be patient to pick up the notes of walnut and oak rising from the stout upon which this beer was made (oil of aphrodite). the habanero is felt in the swallow but its a light heat. in fairness i love habs and you might perceive more heat. the cinnamon and cacao nibs balance the pepper and the barrel holds everything together in an unlikely tasty stout. a bit more malty char would be welcome but thats a personal preference and not a complaint.  mouthfeel is good but not great. id love a bit more body in this stout. more carbonation would be welcome.  overall an outstanding stout that i interestingly found a bit better when colder than i usually drink stouts. the mix seemed more flavorful when first poured.
1434,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.46,this is a very nice stout - cinnamon and cacao nibs with a bakers chocolate taste then the heat from the peppers. nice barrel but not overpowering. i really enjoyed this.
1435,BDCS,4.48,sampling a cellar temp 12 oz can poured into my snifter vintage 2022 but no other date stamp on the label. received in a trade courtesy of @russpowell. thank you!  the beer pours a rich dark coffee brown color and no light passes through my glass when i hold it to a light source. a dense creamy head of 1 cm of tan foam rises up from the pour and quickly fades to a sturdy edge layer that sticks around throughout my sampling. there are also a few small islands spinning in the center of the glass. also get some scattered lacing when i swirl the glass or take a sip. aroma is malt forward with milk chocolate vanilla brown sugar and a good whiff of bourbon note. no warm or fusol alcohol more of the sweet side of bourbon. also no hop presence here at all on the nose. first sip reveals a very smooth textured medium bodied beer with fine soft and gentle carbonation. the carb is very fine and gentle which all makes for a velvety smooth physical experience. flavor is what the nose advertises with sweet chocolate brown sugar and some vanilla all giving way to bourbon notes and a little warming on the swallow. bourbon flavor lingers and also coats my lips. i do get a little bit of a coffee note in the back of each swallow too. again no hops to be found. quite a nice imperial milk stout one that i would gladly drink again.
1436,BDCS,4.36,12oz can courtesy of russpowell. 2022 vintage. 10.3% abv 69 ibus (whatever they mean anymore) per ut.  poured into a snifter this was an inky black with no interest in becoming any lighter even when held up to light. modest half inch of khaki-mocha colored head. sparse spotty lacing.  bourbon up front in the nose along with milk chocolate and coffee notes pretty much in that order.  more complex in the taste than in the nose. still bourbon-y up front and with a milk chocolatey sweetness but theres also a bit of tobacco and dark fruit to the flavor. it all melds together very very well.  body is a little bit lighter than i expected but not to a deal-breaking extent. mouth feel is fairly creamy.  this is a very nice bba stout one that hit the spot after dinner tonight. earlier this week i found out for certain that my mom does not have stomach cancer as was feared for a time. i decided to drink this beer today to celebrate that fact and i dont think i mis-chose at all. i would happily drink this beer again as a dessert or nightcap. thanks russ!
1437,BDCS,4.49,opaque dark brown body; thick creamy light tan head. milk chocolate and vanilla tones on the nose. incredibly smooth and complex flavors; milk chocolate; very subtle sense of whiskey; vanilla; light cinnamon spiciness; light bitterness peeking below the overall sweetness. heavy body; dense and silky on the palate; very muted boozy warmth.  this is just an awesome barrel aged imperial stout - a double cream stout per the notes. the base beer really shines while the barrel aging amplifies but doesnt overpower the beer. depth and complexity are rife with this beer. very very tasty.  pouring temperature: 40.2 ℉; canning info: n/a source: @ocalafox via @russpowell
1438,BDCS,4.21,label is marked bdcs 2022. black colored body with a very thin edge of mahogany colored edge. aroma of smooth blended aromas of roasted malts and chocolate malts. taste of sweet chocolate and stout malt. sweet nectar mouth feel. quiet carbonation. rich in nose and flavors try it if you can.
1439,BDCS,4.84,12oz can pours dark shiny black like used motor oil with a brief mocha colored head which leaves a ring of foam around the top of the glass.  aroma is roasted malt chocolate cream oak vanilla and bourbon.  taste is very similar to the aroma with roasted malt chocolate cream bourbon dark roast coffee vanilla a hint of char and the taste of dark fruits (cherry) mingling about. is initially sweet but quickly replaced with the bourbon.  mouthfeel is oily smooth with a little carbonation and boozy alcohol warmth.  dangerously easy to drink for a 10.2% avb ba stout.  i’m fortunate to live close so i’ll be stocking up for the long year in-between releases.
1440,BDCS,3,pours a nice oily black with a thin dark brown head quickly dissipating right a thin ring. nose is some roasted malt raisins coffee and chocolate. taste follows suit but is overwhelmingly sweet. quite cloying. feel is smooth and slick. overall quite average.
1441,BDCS,4.5,pours a dark shiny black color. completely opaque and oily. two finger velvety mocha colored head forms on the beer lingers a moment then dissipates. a thick ring of residual velvety foam remains on the outside of the top of the beer. aroma has notes of roasted malts milk chocolate cream oak bourbon and a subtle piney hoppiness.  taste follows the nose with notes of roasted malts chocolate a touch of char oak bourbon some creamy notes cocoa and some light piney hops. the underlying stout is quite nice and the bourbon barrels provide a lovely depth and complexity. feel is medium to full bodied smooth with moderate carbonation.  overall its a lovely well crafted bourbon barrel aged stout. always a pleasure to drink.
1442,BDCS,4.75,pours onyx black with just a smidge of dark mahogany brown on the edges and a dense creamy tan head. absolutely gorgeous beer. the nose is fudgy milk chocolate bourbon from the barrel vanilla and oak - and the slightest bit of stone fruit (dark cherry).  o. m. g.  the taste is as described on ozark’s website - a bourbon soaked brownie with the added caveat of dark cherry flavor that works spectacularly well with the fudge and bourbon barrel flavors. this is frighteningly easy to drink for a 10.2% abv ba stout.  the mouthfeel is rich decadent and creamy. simply delightful. one thing to note - one of the cofounders worked for goose island and brewed that brewery’s bcbs.  he apparently learned a lot because this beer takes the best of bcbs and cranks up the drinkability quotient. this is the best beer i’ve had in 2022 and may be a top 10 overall beer for me.  that’s right i typed that.
1443,BDCS,4.49,mystery can received in bif 16 from @russpowell  poured into an ozark brewing snifter  brewersnotes: imperial double cream stout aged in bourbon barrels for 8 months.  #3 ranked sweet/milk stout on beer advocate  bourbon double cream stout (bdcs) is brewed with massive amounts of roasted malts boiled with milk sugar fermented with an ale yeast and then aged in fresh kentucky bourbon barrels.  aroma is tobacco. my dad smoked borkum riff pipe tobacco which is a bourbon flavored pipe tobacco….bourbon barrel brown sugar dark fruits…..taste is dark fruits raisins plum brown sugar ..low sudsing sweet delicious..i like it…hint of a very slight chocolate notes  smooth  not syrupy but you realize there is booziness in this drink a full body  delicious enjoyable and repeatable/….might fine beer
1444,BDCS,4.02,bringing a little heat to the party ozark beer allows for an extended aged imperial stout to bring all the bourbony warmth that would ever want to be inside of a beer.  dark and tawny garnet brown bdcs 22 hits the glass with an ominous looking pour with a dainty trickle of foam for decoration. as a bourbon laced scent of dark roast coffee caramel maple chocolate and toasted nuttiness lays across the nose the flavors open up with a sweet heat of coconut chocolate molasses vanilla and caramel.  as the sweetness is quickly chased away by the roast and booze the flavors of espresso sets in with bakers chocolate roasted walnut and campfire to follow. interrupted by the barrel the flavors soon dominate with the strong oaken toasted wood weathered barrel influence with savory heat and bitter spices to close.  full bodied full flavored and laying on the tongue with a heated glaze the stout finishes both hot and sweet with a linger of savory heat in a long lasting afterglow.
1445,Old Chub,4.75,poured up into my irish pint glass.  appearance: nice dark amber with a nice white foamy head that settles into a ring of foam around the glass with decent lacing.  smell: caramel with toffee with nice malt forward toasted notes. some bittersweet chocolate as well.  body: full bodied and thick very satisfying on the mouthfeel.  taste: nice malt forward upfront with delicious dark fruits plums raisins. did i say raisins? sure did and it`s delicious followed by some banana in the background with coffee notes with bitter sweet chocolate. despite the 8% abv no boozy aftertaste at all.  overall: this is absolutely delicious!! nice full bodied scotch ale loaded with flavor that the craft beer enthusiast will love!! not a beer to be swilled down due to the the 8% abv. savor and enjoy! cheers!!
1446,Old Chub,4.29,dark brown color sweet chocolate taste. try a sixer and get back to me in the morning.
1447,Old Chub,4.27,12 oz. can for only a buck eighty nine - canned on 8/16/22 look - deep brown a little ruby comes thru when held to the light tan head good lacing smell - malty smoky chocolate taste - smoky malt sweet chocolate dark roast coffee feel - medium body lightly carbonated bit of syrup on the finish overall - old chub has a nice deep dark look with good head retention. i really like the smoky malt scent and flavor mixed in with the sweet chocolate and dark roast coffee notes. solid 8% scotch ale ive had many times and find quite enjoyable to drink. is it too wee heavy? i dont think so but find out for yourself. pick it up and pair it up with the pretenders - middle of the road. enjoy!
1448,Old Chub,4.28,12oz can canned 11/16/22 into a willie becher. l: pours reddish dark brown w a 3/4+ creamy khaki head w good retention down to edge foam low carbo some lacing w initial sheeting light banding. s: highly toasted candied caramelized malts toffee a hint of cocoa light molasses brown bread dark fruits butter & oak wood with warming. t: sweet caramelized malts light toffee roasted grains raisins a hint of grape a hint of citrus zest which goes wide moderately floral lightly nutty & gently woody. f: a bit cola-like then lightly creamy smooth med-bodied w a med-length moderately drying finish lightly chewy. o: a malty brew w a lovely hop crispness resulting in a wee bit of a dry finish lightly fruity gently sweet complex and quite delicious. ez drinking for its 8% abv and it is outstanding in its style. i will buy this again.
1449,Old Chub,3.89,appearance: pours a mildly clear deep bronze color with a strong tan head. srm of 20. (4.25)  aroma: strong aromas of scotch molasses maple syrup. a caramel sweetness within. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of scotch molasses and maple syrup. scotch and booze clear the palate. very faint smoke. (3.75)  feel: medium-bodied average to low carbonation. finishes sweet with some booze on the bite. (3.75)  compared to founders dirty bastard 1/2023: pours similar slightly darker. milder aromas. more scotch maple syrup. less caramel chocolate sweet malt. more of a boozy bite.  overall: a nice scotch/wee-heavy here. showcases the scotch flavors and maple syrup well. appropriately shows the booze a bit. pretty standard for a macro scotch ale. (rating: 3.89)
1450,Old Chub,5,i got a 6 pack at grocery outlet in lincoln city oregon where we were vacationing for $9. i love english and scotch ales so i thought yeah why not? even though i had never heard of it. man i wish i had bought a trunk full to bring back to california. its delicious!
1451,Old Chub,4,poured from a 12oz can into a libbey. can purchased on 10/17/22. can date 10//22.  l- gorgeous deep ruby red.  s- sweet malty nose.  t- sweet almost tangy flavor.  f- an almost “birch beer “ flavor. very complex.  o- a great scotch ale!
1452,Coors Extra Gold,3.62,i researched and cant get a straight answer on if this beer is still brewed by molson coors. this is a beer that you could drink one or twelve..... smooth and consistent in taste. i hope to see on the ohio shelves in the future.
1453,Coors Extra Gold,4.36,underrated... such a great tasting beer... sorry it had little to no success in my region. i live in a college town that has mega package stores but no extra gold.... american big brews are so underrated.... when they try an extra gold or dopple bock they get axed by the rednecks and hipsters!!!!
1454,Coors Extra Gold,2.52,12 oz gold can  a: pours a bright golden color. one finger of bubbly white head. strong carbonation. no head retention or lacing. color is nice though.  s: cool to the nose. malts and grains. sweet smelling. cereal and corn.  t/m: grainy and sweet. dry. malts. a little creamy. moderate carbonation. crisp clean dry finish. slight hop taste. grassy and faintly floral. bready malts.  o: pretty boring beer. light on taste with a halfway decent mouthfeel. could be crisper for me. i’ve had worse from this style.  cheers!
1455,Coors Extra Gold,3.92,honestly some of the best beer you can get for $6.50 a 12 pack. in my opinion tastes better than budweiser has the same abv and is much much cheaper. now im not a huge fan of budweiser myself but i know people are huge on it and to those people id say buy this and save a few bucks.
1456,Coors Extra Gold,2.27,rates about halfway between poor and below average. pours a clear light gold color with decent head that fades quickly. aroma is sweet and grainy. taste follows the scent just something slightly off that i cant describe. a bit more than light mouthfeel and an aftertaste that is best scribed as tinny
1457,Coors Extra Gold,5,best beer ever. and cheap
1458,Coors Extra Gold,5,when i first drank it it had a bit to it and after the first one i noticed it was going down rather smooth and had a very enjoyable taste. i have now been drinking is for 5 years and you cant beat the price!
1459,Coors Extra Gold,4.94,extra gold lager is a rich full-flavored lager with a deep golden color. starts with slow aged roasted (near toasty and you can taste it) malts which are then combined with its other ingredients (only: water barley malt a germinated corn grind for a little extra maltose coors own nearly bottom possible temp yeast cascade hops certainly but i cant get an answer on their strain. likely typical lager finishing hops because this beer is all lager. if it was in a clear miller high life bottle with a redesign it would go from lawnmower beer to the top of the domestic lager game. its a robust beautiful full crisp clean and perfect example of an american lager. slow-brewed to produce this truly refined lager in an unassuming packaging at an unassuming price. if i were pr i would repitch it with a marketing strategy and get back to basics. theyre too bloated and monopolized to realize a blind test would put them in the top 5 american lagers. i picture a small coors original shape bottle with the brown glass and the stubby style with the same price.  ingredients: water barley malt corn syrup (maltose) yeast hop extract
1460,Coors Extra Gold,4.18,this here is a pretty gosh-darn easy lager to enjoy folks. unpretentious; best appreciated very very cold. a consistent pleasure for when what one wants is just a simple beer. and as far as i can net-investigate brewed only at the golden colorado brewery. this is a fine excellent brew. one i hope coors/molson continues to brew.  which it didnt. so good-bye extra gold twas good to enjoyeth. r.i.p. (rest in recipe)
1461,Coors Extra Gold,4.58,i can barely tell it apart from banquet by flavor. color slightly more golden. excellent m-f classic american lager.
1462,Coors Extra Gold,3.68,the color is extra golden actually more like copper with a quickly dissipating white head of foam.  smells like it has a bit of some sour mash maybe like sour malts. got it! with that bread like lager smell this smells like a sourdough bread. love it or leave it.  the taste is pretty unremarkable or shocking. tastes like a macro lager with a hint of sour. the sour is not offensive or overpowering. there is a bit of some sweet coming into play as well.  mouth is a bit more towards medium with that unusual sour and sweet. finishes easy with just a bit of oiliness.  overall not a bad beer but more of what i would call it an inexpensive beer. found this in a colorado liquor store for 16.99 when i went back to denver for a bit. this beer lends itself to be drinking it out of a can not a glass. i dont even think it wants to be analyzed because i think the cans are saying just open me and drink the damn beer.
1463,Coors Extra Gold,4.55,i know opinions are like assholes everyone got one and they all stink...but in my defense i drank this beer before i was of age and every now and again when i want to feel like i’m doing something wrong but still want to feel good about it i buy two twelve packs. once they are gone i move on once a year is good enough for me it’s kinda like pizza even bad pizza is still kinda good cause i mean it’s pizza come on you with me
1464,Traquair House Ale,4.02,500ml bottle into a pint glass. best by may 2029.  excellent looking beer. deep deep amber body with reddish hints. well carbonated and the off white head retains well leaving streaks of lacing. aroma is strong malty and sweet with faint hints of scotch.  strong tasting as well. massive malt bill notes of scotch peat and the barrel. a little sweet. finish is slightly drying.  overall full bodied wee heavy nice beer to muse over watching cricket and soccer this evening.
1465,Traquair House Ale,3.82,smell gives off molasses plum very malty. the body is very crisp coming out like a really crunchy crust of bread followed shortly by a sumptious flow of molasses plum some cacao and caramel too. the bodys great very malty and thick yet crisply carbonated carries flavor amazingly. the flavor is mellow for the price though to be honest.
1466,Traquair House Ale,4.42,11.2 fl oz. bottle looks like a best by date of jan 2032. a new oddity to me from the local beer spot; handmade ale brewed in the ancient brew house of the oldest inhabited house in scotland.  poured to a clear stemless wine snifter. a: pours a dark mahogany / chestnut / ruby body. small conjuring of tan bubbles that remains as a surface skimming. it does appear adequately carbonated with some good sticky lacing. (legs?) s: aroma is deep & intricate. definitely a beer to ponder after a quaff. it hits softly but is super layered & complex. aromas of smoke cherry wood some minor alcohol / booze fumes vanilla caramel cream. again this aroma is soft almost supple but the authenticity on display here is the stunning part. t: taste brings in what the nose promises. notes of smoke raisin oak wood vanilla caramel cream. only slightly sweet but never overly sugary or sticky. subtle dark fruits - cherry raisin with just a hint of copper. (bottle says this beer is brewed in a 1738 copper kettle before being fermented on oak). mouthfeel is absolutely perfect for this type of beer carbonation is lowww super easy drinking for the modest 7.2% abv.  overall authentic & absolutely delicious. traquair house ale -----4.5/5
1467,Traquair House Ale,4.3,poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a thistle glass (or maybe a vase). deep reddish brown colored body with ruby highlights and a light tan head that left minimal lacing as it settled. a fruity note is prominent with sweet roasted malt light caramel and a hint of smoke. oaky tannins on the finish with some lingering bitterness. overall a fine beer that begs for a food accompaniment. bangers anyone?
1468,Traquair House Ale,4.46,i really like the color on this one. held in front of a mag light its kind of a shiny metallic red/brown. smells good too. malty woody and vinous. flavor is rich malt oak and surprisingly a pleasant fruitiness. tannins from the cask apparent which mingle with hops and add some black tea notes. resinous mouth feel briny carbonation. a wee bit light in body for a heavy. alcohol undetectable. i love this beer!
1469,Traquair House Ale,4.32,purchased at purvis beer in richmond a suburb of melbourne in australia in november 2021.  colour is hard to describe. is it muddy brown or amber or dark burnt copper? maybe all of them...  aroma has cola some dark fruits a tangy caramellyness and some tobacco.  taste has sweetness brown sugar (burnt?) molasses raisins and red fruit. alcohol is unnoticeable.  mouthfeel is well balanced with mild carbonation.  overall this is an excellent and given how well it hides its alcohol possibly quite dangerous beer. it screams of warm fires misty walks and fog-bound valleys. beer as a device for long contemplation is on display in this glass. if this is what the scottish lairds were drinking back in the day they were fortunate men!  cheers!
1470,Traquair House Ale,4.5,bottle from altopalato served at home in a thistle glass. brown color medium head with average retention good lacing. aroma of licorice oak caramel prunes vanilla. medium to full body viscous texture average carbonation. sweet finish. taste of licorice caramel prunes oak. wonderful.
1471,Traquair House Ale,4.2,pours transparent dark amber small off white quickly dissipating head aromas of dark roasted malt warm leather work boots left out banana peels freshly packed marlboro reds flip top box decomposing leaves flavors of italian roast coffee carmel clove burnt sugar pumpernickel raisin oak feels crispy up front tiny effervescent bubbles medium body finishes semi dry overall not as sweet as many scotch ales and certainly hides the alcohol.
1472,Fuzzy,4.55,im finding i am really enjoying white peaches specifically in wild ales just lend themselves to barrel funk and botanicals so well. here sp has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too. smell is damn impressive: sour peach yogurt barnyard and barrel funks bright and rustic oak pressed flowers dry earth a touch of lemon and lime zest and finished with big hay. taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent. feel is sour and decently acidic but gentle dries out with various funks almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells. clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam. this is right up there with the best peach wild ales little less acidity and it could be the very top
1473,Fuzzy,4.49,2022 vintage  here we are the #1 wild ale on ba for my 1500th review! this is a special one that has been a long time want for me so i’m very excited to finally try it. i’ve only had a few side project beers but they’ve all been fantastic so i have no reason to think this one wouldn’t be. let’s get into it  pours a cloudy pale gold with 2 fingers of whitehead that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing  this is certainly tart in the nose but it has a surprisingly nice balance to it. im picking up on aromas of tart peach lemon yogurt sharp oak tannic white wine straw bready malt wildflower honey apple skin light vinegar stone and even a touch of smoke  in taste it starts off with a balanced tartness similar to the aroma and on the back end explodes with an aggressive flash of tartness before settling down once again. on the front end of the sip im tasting jammy peach lemon juice vanilla wet hay straw smooth oak leather and white grape. the swallow brings notes of tart peach lemon juice crabapple white wine vinegar sharp oak wet hay vanilla bready malt and light peat smoke  a medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a puckering beer. finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time  oh yeah this is damn good. despite the not so good looks everything else here is awesome. a truly unique beer
1474,Fuzzy,4.42,appearance - the beer was the color of a peach. it was orange with red hues toward the center.  smell - the beer smelled like sour peaches. there was an undercurrent of sweetness like vanilla.  taste - the profile was quite acidic like a soured peach. notes of peach and peach skin were detected. there seemed of be the presence of vanilla sweetness as well. the profile had a nice sour peach finish.  mouthfeel - the body had little carbonation but a pleasant smoothness.  overall - this is a sour that i can enjoy and i am not a sour guy.
1475,Fuzzy,4.57,this was a guest beer on tap during the 2021 zwanze day celebration i attended. 2020 fuzzy at a year’s age.  loved the nose on this. stone fruit in season white peach and a hint of funk. it’s tart without being overly sour with a nuanced finish. more of the peach notes leaving the palate tingling. fantastic.
1476,Fuzzy,4.15,a: tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. the neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription from the preset retention. howbeit an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility as the intervals thermally protract. there’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance  s: pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. illustrated by a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. the progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols which quietly idle funk steps. principally satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. nonetheless acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. there’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. on the other hand that piece is often stupefied given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals  t: a clean consecutive punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of goldrich apricots and armking nectarines while briny minerals perimeter neptune grass. in correlation an engine for eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg while maintaining that peppery attenuation. the ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. to that end the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. aerial attacks begin setting in from oak dragged elasticities and prompt in some leathery satchels. whilst chardonnay attenuates a staleness for budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness  m: does not puncture with puckered acridity but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. namely a backend for rustic brettanomyces and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. the approach is brisk in carbonation as the approach is crisp in sensation. thus cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs  o: showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines of wild yeast. though development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities and make rational moves. in this situation light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. the approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition
1477,Fuzzy,4.43,look - great clear golden color with a slight white skimming smell - nice slight peach wild ale smell taste - fantastic peach easy going slight tart feel - crisp with a medium body overall - just fantastic
1478,Fuzzy,4.8,excelent beer
1479,Fuzzy,4.38,bottle generously shared by seth. cloudy pale yellow pour with a white head. sour peach aromas. big tart/sour notes with peach highlights. lemon zest and citrus lowlights. good body and mouthfeel.
1480,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.16,pale yellow thick and juicy looking so hazy you can’t see through it! topped with one finger of fast dissipating white head. the smell is of orange citrus a hint of pine. certainly not as pronounced as i was expecting. the taste is very fruity and juicy like a perfect refined orange juice with a hint of dank ness and an abundance of tropical notes but all very muted. light and foamy feeling body very smooth! i’ve been anticipating this brew for a long time i got it at beer hub in waynesville north carolina and i’m drinking in maggie valley august 12 2023. i must admit the hype around this set my expectations quite high and it is a great beer. however not nearly as perfect as i was expecting. but certainly worth searching out.
1481,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.29,poured the requisite opaque yellow orange with a growing manilla colored head. no floaties to be seen. the aroma is lost on my covid damaged nose. stupid covid. the taste was a tale of two beers- at first it was magnificent with citrus notes and a hint of piney pith. i’m thinking this is awesome! then i let it warm up a bit and it shifted to a dryer more pithy taste. no idea why it was still really good just not magnificent. the feel is solid smooth and no chunks of anything. easy quaffing. oa good nay great dipa and i may get more. or i might just stick with regular king sue.
1482,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.05,draught pour at champps americana in brookfield wi. this was a bit of a letdown - a solid (d)neipa for sure but it is very green not quite vegetal but definitely not an improvement over the original. i have no idea how old the key is but assuming it is very fresh perhaps the beer improves after a couple of weeks?
1483,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.56,one of the best beers ive had.
1484,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.5,look...a beautiful vibrant light orange with a ton of carbonation and white foamy head. a proper looking unfiltered dipa smell...a burst of orange pineapple pink grapefruit mango and all types of floral aromas. a dank grass is fielded by the dry hopping imbibing a pungency taste...orange bitter pineapple express with the dank hoppy bitterness with the dry component i believed caused by the dry hopping feel...an astringent juice feel with a sticky convergence of foam . great carbonation launching a good fullness. overall...this beer i tried today for the 4th time is one of the elite beers i get to try. sometimes a beer just hits you and says wow and this for me has that quality. king sue its close cousin i felt the first time i had that too!! if you see this beer and like unfiltered dipas you would be a fool not to pick this up. i saw in one of the other reviews had this at 25 before tax and deposit and that is steep but damn this beer is nice . i paid 20 before tax and deposit but i was on the lookout for this to try for a while and i am not disappointed
1485,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.54,as advertised - a more vibrant flavorful version of king sue. expensive at $24.95 for 4. flavorful but the alcohol remains under control. prefer the ddh version & would like to do again.
1486,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.35,a - pours a hazy golden orange with a fizzy one finger head. the fades fast leaving some light soapy lacing.  s - aroma is orange pineapple and grapefruit.  t - the taste is orange grapefruit peel pineapple and a big kick of piney hops.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. crisp mouthfeel with a soft fizzy finish.  o - really solid but maybe a tad bit overrated.
1487,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,3.95,canned 5/22/23. milky yellow with brief tight white head; poor cap retention; thin ring a few spots of lace. overripe fruit odd (cryo?) nose. taste is overripe citrus and tropical fruit - orange and pineapple. mouthfeel is astringent and full of hop burn; medium body light carbonation. overall for me this beer is unfiltered crap…i’m shocked at how much i don’t like this highly rated beer.
1488,HefeWeizen,3.36,pours a murky straw color. im disappointed in the head particularly in its poor retention and hesitation to grow. the aroma is far superior showing off clove banana and bubblegum in equal measure. some nice wheat notes pop up after warming up a tad. flavor-wise it follows the nose albeit not as intensely. the banana clove and bubblegum are all there albeit muted. i also get some wheat flavor on the finish. everything is properly balanced and where it should be its just that everything is at 60% intensity. the mouthfeel is oddly sharp and honestly a bit watery. the carbonation is there but the softness isnt...not at all. did the dmv get a lesser batch or something? this is definitely not the #2 hefeweizen to me and it certainly doesnt measure up to the best german examples. its fine though - id take it over quite a few american-made hefeweizens.
1489,HefeWeizen,3.56,on tap: note: had can from same distribution as keg and it didnt perform any better in fact slightly worse. there are obvious differences in what others are perceiving so maybe we just got a subpar batch in the dc area??  the beer allowed the bartender to fill liquid to the top of the glass. even drinking it down a tad and swirling things around barely revived the razor thin ring of bubbles. the body was a fairly cloudy pale bruised banana.  the nose is of moderate strength but has a banana bubblegum quality that is nice. a little bit of the banana comes through in the taste but there’s also a lemon-spritzed grain flavor that is more prominent as i started sipping.  allowing the beer to warm a bit (along with noshing a little food) opened up some more familiar hefe notes. the banana and bubblegum upped their game a bit to replace the tangy lemon-like note i was getting edging the beer towards the sweeter side of balanced.  overall this still wasn’t wowing me and i think the somewhat watery feel i was perceiving hurt it the most. i’d be willing to give this highly rated beer another try at least to see if maybe i was just a bit off today.
1490,HefeWeizen,4.65,when i first drank this - bought from an exxon station of all places - i didnt know anything about beer. but i knew immediately this was something special and it became my choice when i wanted to upgrade from a 40oz malt liquor. in the years since i have learned to name the component flavors and the processes that yield them in the brew which im sure you can research. but that all seems beside the point.  what is the point then? simply: this is a smooth tasty complex beer. very little compares in the us and it\s better than paulaner. you can enjoy it slowly. you can smash it. equally interesting to the scholar and the party animal. a desert island beer that would also work in the frozen tundra. the last beer you might ever need. the omni-brew.
1491,HefeWeizen,3.7,2023-06-10 12oz can served in something similar to a wineglass with no stem. can is dated 02.14.23. got it from @mrsandman101 in a trade.  pours moderately hazy with a fairly small foamy short-lived head which settles to nothing at all. theres a little bit of active carbonation that i can see. smell is spot-on yeasty banana notes a little spiciness that makes me think of cloves.  taste is also spot-on reinforcing what i got from the nose. theres also a nice grainy characteristic.  mouthfeel is leaning toward thin feels pretty still. overall...tastes good smells good needs some head retention -- it looks indecently naked!
1492,HefeWeizen,4.37,date on can: 04/19/2023  pours a cloudy golden orange in color with a finger thick foamy head that dissipates to a thin layer with time. carbonation looks quite lively. theres a fair amount of lacing as you drink although most of it slides down the glass. pretty standard look for a hefeweizen although i think the head could be a bit creamier and longer lasting. nit-picking though.  lots of banana clove and bubble-gum on the nose. bread and butter with a hint of spice. not unlike banana bread. a classic hefeweizen aroma.  taste follows the nose pretty much identically. banana wheat/bread clove bubble-gum. simple yet refined and very clean.  this is medium bodied with delicately zesty carbonation and a tiny bit of chewiness. i actually expected this to be over-carbonated happy to report that it is not. however i also expected this to be chewier it feels a bit thin overall though that does lend to its drinkability.  this is a finely crafted bavarian style hefeweizen. if you gave it to me blind i would probably guess that it was from bavaria which is truly high praise. i doubt i could find a better brew of this style in the u.s. it wont be my highest rated for the style but its certainly up there. i must admit that i am not a huge hefeweizen fan though i do crave them occasionally. this one drinks extremely smooth and clean. it is simple but whats there is high quality. ive actually had this one several times but for some reason never got around to rating it. i did not realize it had such a high rating here but it seems entirely justified. live oak continues to impress i have not had anything from them that has been less than superior. cheers!
1493,HefeWeizen,4.84,on tap in a pint glass from a bar in austin texas. look: classic hefeweizen look (mildly opaque straw yellow) with 0.5 fingers of white head smell: wheat and bananas taste: follows the nose. plenty of wheat bread and banana notes. feel: medium bodied with good carbonation overall: there is no doubt why this beer is considered world class by beer advocate. delicious and on par with the best hefeweizen beers from germany. i was so impressed with the taste of this beer that i returned to the same bar the following night and ordered another.
1494,HefeWeizen,4.23,3/28/23 on tap at live oak brewing austin tx  hazy yellow. plenty of lingering lacing.  certainly reminiscent of weihenstephaner heffe perhaps slightly thinner and less complex but certainly high quality.  enjoyed this one very much.
1495,HefeWeizen,4.67,elite hefeweizen that hits all the notes. banana bubble gum touch of cloves on the aroma and taste... lighter bodied easy drinking. maybe borders on a little thin if im nitpicking..probably the best u-s made hefeweizen ive had and better than some germans like paulaner.
1496,HefeWeizen,4.53,12oz can from tx locals trade  pours a nice straw yellow with a bubbly head  traditional hef aroma heavy on clove and banana  wheaty banana and spice  lighter body with just enough carbo  probably one of the most solid hefs ive ever had.
1497,Old Milwaukee,1,barf
1498,Old Milwaukee,2.09,old milwaukee beer  the look of it : a finger of head that quickly goes away. yellow golden color. light carbonation. nothing special about it.  the smell of it: sweet grain and some corn  the taste of it: taste like a newspaper.  so overall would i recommend it ? no ! wanna have a cheap beer go get a pabst !  would i buy it again ? no
1499,Old Milwaukee,3.57,i rather like this stuff. for a mass-produced beer i find that it has a unique characteristic taste which hits the spot sometimes. this is a notch above the rest of the pack. its still just a plain old american adjunct lager but its a good example of the style imo.
1500,Old Milwaukee,2.25,ok now im confused. two old millwaters listed on here from two different breweries. had to give them the same rating. i believe the one we drank in college was brewed by either schlitz or strohs. i am not sure and it really doesnt matter.
1501,Old Milwaukee,3.23,new to this beer not that bad good head crisp with a bit o sweetness smooth
1502,Old Milwaukee,2.43,leftover from a party a couple of weekends ago. served cold in a pint glass. figured if i was going to drink it might as well review it. gave it 2.5 across the board last time.  appearance - pale piss yellow color with two fingers of fluffy white head that dissipate very quickly. lots of bubbles and good clarity.  smell - some general light grain aroma possibly some corn. not anything else.  taste - thin with initially a touch of grain and some corn sweetness and cooked veggies to close. not great but worse certainly exists. nothing too weird going on with after flavors.  mouthfeel - thin fizzy and otherwise non-descript.  overall - decidedly mediocre however worse aals are certainly out there and this is enjoyable enough if youre thirsty enough or its hot enough outside.
1503,Super Fresh,3.93,surprise like going to try more peak brews.
1504,Super Fresh,4.08,poured a cloudy yellow-gold body with lace sheath ring down glass. mild hoppy lager-esque aroma. clean crisp light beer that balances a dry hoppy crispness with a pils malt sweetness and clean finish. abv does not seem nearly as high as listed and very easy to drink beer.
1505,Super Fresh,3.37,appearance – half finger head on a yellow very slightly hazy body.  aroma – grapefruit and white pine. sure was right about being heavy on hops.  taste – light bitterness hop resins and lighter malts. not very complex.  mouthfeel – light and refreshing.  overall – i thought there would be more layers to the flavor. not a bad beer but somewhat average.
1506,Super Fresh,4.01,big bold grassy aroma. pours a cloudy amber with a white head. clean malt flavor going to tropical fruit pine and grass notes. a bit full bodied for a pilsner but it is an imperial one. overall a very nice example of the style.
1507,Super Fresh,4.38,tallboy poured into a pilsner glass. paired with tofu parm and brussels sprouts.  appearance: a hazy straw with a big foaming white head.  aroma: well it’s super fresh. hops cut grass spring leaves. very clean.  taste: floral hoppy grassy full of bite. some fruit somewhat tropical. herbaceous.  mouthfeel: perfect for style. super drinkable at 7+.  overall: a powerhouse. one of the best pilsners in new england. get it.
1508,Super Fresh,4.02,16oz can into a pint glass. packaged 10/24/17 so 2 months old (not exactly super fresh)  hazy yellow-orange body small but persistent white head leaving excellent lacing.  faintly fruity aroma.  good tasting beer. doesnt really come off as a pilsener though. good hop bite slight fruity and cattiness. dryish too.  well over medium on the mouth slightly foamy. sour and bitter on the finish.  overall i like the taste of the beer but even at 2 moths old it comes off as more of a pale ale than a pilsener.
1509,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2,let me start by saying i can hold my liquor/alcohol quite well and in no way mean that as bragging but when this beer came out i drank 2 24oz cans because it was cheap. well i went home and distroyed my entire house for no reason and couldnt even remember doing it but i was the only one home!! smh
1510,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.48,purchased a 24 oz can for $1.29 including beverage tax at a gas station in dayton ohio.  look: straw yellow color medium head. no lacing.  smell: strong sweet smell green apple and malts.  taste: very very sweet. i can barely taste any alcohol. was actually disappointed by the lack of graininess since i genuinely love a good aal. virtually no hops. remarkably inoffensive for the high alcohol content but no character either almost like beer flavored soda with less carbonation and some alcohol. the sweetness is just way too much even for a malt liquor fan. there is still some fusel taste but it is masked by the extreme sweetness.  feel: very light body even lighter than *only* 8% abv cheap lagers like steel reserve and even the watery natty daddy. weak carbonation which means you can chug easily and get drunk very fast which may be dangerous with a beer of this abv.  overall: my previous review was more positive but honestly i cant recommend this beer for anyone. as a malt liquor it is terrible even compared to the usual high gravity brews and seems to be targeting the alcopop crowd with its excessive sweetness but wont please anyone except those looking for the fastest buzz from a beer. interesting because it pushes the limits of what is considered beer but even earthquake is way better. stay away!
1511,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.78,do not buy this. yes 10% alcohol is about twice that of the other drinks. drink twice the other f_n drinks!!!!!  look: 5. looks ghetto like a 40 should looks like 10% alcohol a wisconsin product while im a state away from home smell:2 - eww. kinda opinionated and sweet taste:1- i regret spending $10 of my last $25 on 4 of these!!!!!!!!!!!! damn indiana sunday-no liquor-laws making me try to bulk up on this shit!! tastes like a bad brew sweetened with the corn syrup from a warm 7-up. you know that corny ass unrefreshing shit that makes you imagine a lobe of corn (a lobe of corn.... thats a thing right??) instead of the alleged lemons and limes that supposably make up 7-up? idk tastes liek corn to me.... like apart from the 500 calories of alcohol due to the 4 ounces pure alcohol this tastes like it had 200$ of sugar. or a jar or two of sucralose. its disgusting. i hate it. do not buy it. feel:4 i am drunk though i feel slighty disgusted with myself for drinking such ..... (whats the liquid version of slop? slop is a liquid????) slop. overall:3. because drunkness is 5 and taste is one it equals 2.5. 2.5 rounded is 3 ccording to my teachers. thats generous af though because taste should really be negative 5. so really the score is -5 billion cuz reality. do not buy this.  look:close your eyes smell: dont breathe through your nose taste-awful feel- drunk ppl dont have feelings silly.
1512,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.11,24oz monstrous can procured during happy hour at the pizza brew in calgary. stereotypical inner city brick wall graffiti imagery makes up the childish label.  this beer pours a clear medium golden yellow colour with one fat finger of puffy somewhat foamy bone-white head which leaves some stringy webbed lace around the glass as things quickly move southwards.  it smells of that standard minhas house essence - musty dank cardboard industrial effluent apple cores and an acetone-heavy metallic booziness. the taste is more of the same - wet paper a suggestion of grainy corn malt industrial park alcohol adult bubblegum (i.e. boozy) apple mush and very little else - but thats not the point here is it?  the carbonation is soft but fairly frothy the body medium-light in weight smooth like vodka after that initial burning sensation wears off and airily creamy for some reason. it finishes sweet all surprisingly restrained alcohol heat and bland apple fruitiness like a cheaply boozed-up cider.  strangely not the most off-putting or awful-tasting offering from this brewery - sure its alcoholic but it bears that badge with pride and a pleasant enough softness. other than that however this is indeed the lowbrow shit you might take it for all other things being equal.
1513,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.5,okay this is not a beer to trifle with. if one were to drink a 24 oz. can of this and then drive a motor vehicle then he would be almost guaranteed to get arrested on a dui charge. i drank only a 12 oz. serving (on an empty stomach) and was thoroughly drunk. four o street legal malt liquor has a thick off-white creamy head and a deep golden appearance. i was amazed by the abundance of ragged lacing. the can design is completely politically incorrect and it nuances all the wrong things about malt liquor. but for those of us who enjoy cruising the underclass of the beer world it is an interesting beer. no this is certainly not the type of beer i\d drink on a daily basis but for kicks i am enjoying the ride (so please excuse any inebriated verbiage). four o has a strong apple aroma and some grain can be detected in the smell as well. the taste is highly sweet and fruity with some alcohol sting to it. mouth-feel is rather heavy and this concoction finishes wet and sloppy. put it to you like this: if all you care to drink is busch budweiser miller high life shiner bock and coors banquet etc. and you don\t appreciate the wild side of beer then don\t fool with this stuff. but however if you like to go into forbidden zones from time to time i\d recommend you try this (with extreme trepidation to be sure). well for those who relish trying outlandish unacceptable drinks like this i\d recommend a try (at home with an iron-clad assurance that you will not under any circumstances operate a motor vehichle). although you may not like this beer you can\t really argue that it\s not interesting.  update note: about an hour after writing this review i was hit with a nausea that lasted over 24 hours. so thats what i get for going out on a limb and sampling this filth. i really cant with a clear conscience recommend this trash. my advice is to stay away from it and not damage your psyche.  rjt
1514,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.24,oh boy oh boy oh boy! this right here is taking me back. back to the days when i literally drank beer out of a brown paper bag. except now i pour it in a glass. strange.  crystal clear straw yellow color foamy white head is surprisingly sticky on the side of the glass.  the aroma is a sick adjunct combo with a really putrid sourness. huge corn smell.  the flavor is very sweet. highly grainy. then like a bomb the alcohol kicks in. it is like someone dropped a shot of everclear in a bud light.  alcohol burn on the throat and tongue. but decently carbonated.  uh...drink it cold. it obviously is created to get you crunk cause it is a cinch to slam and not savor. which in a strange way...makes it...kind of drinkable? whoa. i think i am gonna have my beer geekdom revoked.
1515,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.27,i cant believe that i have finally gotten around to this beer! it has been in my refrigerator for a couple of months awaiting me getting in the mindset to crack open a 24-ounce can of what i just know in my heart of hearts will be absolute and utter rubbish. i have succumbed to too much garbage in cans to expect anything else. this is the backswing of the canquest - on the upswing are some really quality brews from serious brewers and then there is this kind of thing. onward!  i got a fingers worth of bone-white head out of my pour with low retention settling into wisps. color was a light lemony-yellow with ne-quality clarity. nose had the same fusel alcohol/bubblegum quality that has been noted in many like beers. let us call it like it is - this is cheap mass-produced swill intended for an audience whose sole purpose in drinking this is not for enjoyment but instead to get as banged up as cheaply and as quickly as possible. mouthfeel was very thin with a raspberry-candy like taste on the tongue. that was totally unexpected and nearly caused me to gag. ok. i just made a deal with myself - i will drink half of the can to give it a fair shake but the rest of it goes. in fact i am doing a drainpour right now of everything not in my glass at the moment so that i will not even be tempted to finish it. finish was breathtaking and not in any good way. my chest hurts i can feel the sugar leeching the water out of my brain on my way to a world-class hangover and my asthma is kicking. oof. shame on whomever made this for public sale!  i dislike that i canducted a drain pour at any point during the canquest (tm) & i humbly apologize for having done so. today is sa 26mai 2018 & i am revisiting this beer in its entirety to put things right. the canquest (tm) has a canmitment to drinking every beer to the dregs/lees/punt/kick & this represents an early failing on my part. it also may not have been reviewed to style but my current policy is not to f**k with original often early scores. sorry.  i am so ashamed of my original that i am going to revisit this beer. my overall impression given 10+ years of canflection is that it is not as horrible as i made it sound. it is as advertised - an american malt liquor designed to get you crunked. it is still within the style guidelines but i don\t even want to cantemplete them. it is like quantifying garbage. the maggots lent a piquant flavor ... . okay it\s a fantastic aml but as a beer in general it sux balls! yer the top of the bottom. this is unfit for human cansumption & any to style vs. to taste reviews should be taken accandingly!
1516,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.18,i recently got a 24oz can of this from my girlfriend- she had noticed my malt liquor kick as of late and decided to get me some real ghetto fuel all 10% abv of it. the can proclaims street legal on the front. the can is interesting there is artwork depicting a city skyline with a brick wall below it and graffiti depicting the brand and details. very appropriate considering the target audience for this beer. here is my impressions:  a- again the can is interesting the beer pours a straw yellow. small head that foams rapidly and disappears just as rapidly. looks like a budweiser or typical american lager.  s- smells somewhat syrupy strong corn odors. not a favorable sign prior to tasting  t- i can honestly say this stuff is pretty low on my list of the worst things i have tasted. i made a batch of mead last year that went wrong and it came out with a really high (17%) abv- this taste almost just like that with a strong sweet corn flavor. it literally tastes like it might be a liqueur of some sort. i am not sure it is possible to chug this even with it ice cold. it would be interesting to find out the amount of carbs per serving of this stuff. after a 1.5oz tasting glass of this i am not sure i can drink the can (damn $1.35 down the drain).  m- syrupy do not want to hold it in my mouth any longer than i have to. leaves a sweet alcoholic aftertaste  d- awful i have a feeling if you could put this down rapidly you might vomit. it probably helps to be drunk already or homeless to handle this stuff in quantity. the abv puts it on par with wines for serving size of 6oz in one standard drink (as opposed to 8oz for a typical malt liquor)  conclusion- it might be fun to show off at a party or if you are feeling the need for a quick drunk. undoubtedly this stuff will cause a nasty hangover in quantity. open can of this only in case of emergency!!
1517,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.02,poured from a 24 oz. can. has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is mild a bit malty. taste is yuck. nothing but alcohol i would have been better served pouring this into a shot glass. feels light and yucky in the mouth. i really struggled to finish this can. overall a poor excuse for a beer.
1518,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.44,thrid review tonight  not inebriated yet ... but i will be after this 24 oz...  app.-3.0 looks average for a malt nice and light golden  just like a colt 45 or mickeys.  smell-4.0 sweet sweet malt and hints of alcohol even in the smell. kind of looked forward to the taste.  taste- 1.5 malt and alcohol! i cannot even say the alc. is contained well because its not.  mouthfeel- 3.0 average medium body  due to the alcohol  drinkability 2.0- i can drink this  but itll be hard to pretend to enjoy it  if you want to get messed up drink two of these... otherwise steer clear of this malt liquor.
1519,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.12,pale golden with a small pure white head that quickly shrinks away. the smell is very solvent like grain alcohol with a sweet caramelized onion smell. this shit is just bad metallic and way to hot with a sweet vegetal note that makes it unpalatable. this is the worst malt liquor ive ever had a drain pour.
1520,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.81,sent as part of the good bad and ugly 08 bif. as per the conditions of the bif i must review and send an ugly beer. here she be!  dispensed from a 24oz can with a brick wall on the side enblazoned in spray paint graffitti the words four o street legal. not sure of what street they are referring but whatever.  pours a clear straw color with a very nice looking white head. plenty of lacing and the head actually stays for quite a bit. nice.  aroma is corn cob and sweet liquor. possibly some rice adjunct as well. not a drop of grains but i wasnt expecting that from a malt liquor. again not too bad so far.  kind of sweet when it first hits the tougue. then the rice cereals kick in. a little bit of that alcohol gag comes up due to the sharpness and solvency of the alcohol. kind of an old valentine day candy sort of taste to it: a bit stale yet sweet and somewhat tolerable.  i have to say this wasnt as bad as i was expecting. a beer with graffitti on the label cant be that good but this wasnt all that bad. of course i served this ice cold and as it warmed it became less and less drinkable but i cant say this is the worst beer i have had.  pretty dry finish and candy alcohol in the finish as well. overall sweet and alcoholic. if i was really desperate i may have this. by all means spend your money elsewhere.
1521,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.96,received as part of a winter holidays gift of malt liquors from a friend who doesnt drink beer and thought this was something id like. as hilariously misguided as the gift was i do appreciate trying something new and something id never buy on my own.  pours a very clear corn husk yellow with a one-finger white head that sticks around a fair amount given the alcohol content. fruity esters sweet dominate the nose. perhaps its low expectations but the taste wasnt that bad. clean and not as buttery as i am used to in my malt liquor travels but fruity in flavor and slightly buttery in texture and a very mild carbonation. body is heavy with sweetness but not quite cloying. one of the better malt liquors ive had but not something i want to encounter ever again in my life. once is more than enough.
1522,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.68,well it\s a struggle to know where to begin. gotta love a can that tags itself. pours like a beer syrup with little head that looks infected (little deposits of bubbles at nucleation sites). aroma of corn and cider. hops like they ran past the mashtun with a hop cone at some point in the process. medicinal and alcoholic. taste is just as bad. somehow i think of duvel: what that is this is the opposite. no sublety or grace or balance but oddly enough no worse to drink than the pbr i had last night: there\s something compelling about the big bruising flavor like a big dumb drunk that you enjoy listening to at the bar only because he\s not picking on you and you\re sure he\s bound to pass out soon.
1523,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.91,purchased a 24 oz. can of four o at a liquor store in atlantic city nj. the can was left in a hot car for a few hours to warm up the beer and give the aromatics a chance to shine.  appearance: pours a nice clear yellow with a solid finger-and-a-half of foam that quickly dissolves away. many streams of fine bubbles from the bottom of the glass.  smell: very corny. a slight bitter element almost as if some of the metal from the can leeched into the beer. aroma detected at least two feet away from glass. not pleasant.  taste: for a beer with a cartoony graffiti landscape and the words street legal and 10% abv on the can it showed a surprising amount of sophistication. there was a very strong corn taste with the harsh bitterness but lurking behind everything was a smooth cherry taste more like robitussin than maraschino but cherry nonetheless.  mouthfeel: the fizz just wouldnt stop. stuck to my teeth and roof of my mouth. not pleasant.  drinkability: i finished the 2-4 of 4-0 quite easily once i got past the first 8 oz. of it. the beers feel mellowed out once exposed to air. the price wasnt right ($1.55 plus tax) but that notwithstanding this is an adequate malt liquor for well atlantic city.
1524,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.5,40 ounces can courtesy of unclemattie: poured a golden color beer with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing surprisingly. aroma of fruity ester with some alcoholic phenols. taste is not as bad as expected with some subtle adjunct and some fruit ester. the alcohol is really noticeable and i guess can be expected from a 10% malt liquor. medium body with some good carbonation. this was definitely not as bad as expected but not something i would go for again thought.
1525,Alter Ego,4.9,#179 yum!
1526,Alter Ego,4.46,feeling a bit spoiled after sampling a good variety of th past couple weeks. this is a solid delicious neipa all around and does not disappoint. the wow-factor of some of their other offerings puts this in perspective though as just a fantastic beer.
1527,Alter Ego,4.6,very similar to julius but a bit less sweet with a bit more back-end bitterness. as it warms berry notes begin to appear. i (slightly) prefer it to the original.
1528,Alter Ego,4.55,poured with a crazy foamy head. dark yellow color and opaque. a very unique nose grassy and peppery. less hoppy than most treehouse beers and malty sweet. very soft feel. overall a great beer and definitely a unique beer amongst treehouses hazy collection.
1529,Alter Ego,4.64,alter ego is an american double ipa that boasts a complex hop profile with notes of citrus pine and tropical fruit. the beer has a hazy golden color and a medium body. the flavor is well-balanced with a moderate bitterness that is countered by a subtle sweetness from the malt. the beer finishes dry making it easy to drink and leaving you wanting another sip. overall alter ego is a tasty and well-crafted beer that drinks like a tree house session even though it clocks in at 6.8%!!!
1530,Alter Ego,4.29,16oz can courtesy of roguer.   orange-honey color id call it highly hazy or cloudy in appearance but not truly opaque like some neipas. thick creamy looking head colored somewhere between off-white and beige. lots of lace and sticky globs of foam adhered to the sides of my teku as said head dropped.  aroma is reminiscent of tropical fruits melons stonefruits and grapefruit. big hoppy nose to this in a way that straddles the neipa and wcipa styles. curious to see if the beers hoppiness is as dramatic in the taste.  up front its actually a little less intense than i was expecting. its definitely a fruit forward beer in terms of the flavor hitting the taste bud beachhead but its a bit more restrained. at the finish it is sharply bitter almost grassy and quite dry. this sharp dryness seemed to mellow as it warmed a little after opening.  soft slightly creamy mouth feel.  im not sure this is my new favorite hazy but itd be in the conversation and id hit it regularly if it were local to me. thanks for this andrew!
1531,Dark,4.06,can purchased and drank at the alchemist beer café in stowe vt.  this one pours a very dark black into the mug with a tight white head and lots of lacing.  this smells like toasted malt milk chocolate and dark breadiness.  this is really solid and just made to be super drinkable clean and creamy. there’s a really nice toastiness and breadiness with some roast and lots of chocolate.  this is really creamy with a nice full body but a smooth crispness on the back end.  the alchemist obviously excels at ipas but this shows their brewing range and versatility.
1532,Dark,3.99,pours a deep deep dark brown the brown is only noticeable on the edges when held to light. attractive light brown head that has some nice retention it is very cohesive and refrains from clinging to the glass.  nose has a slight burnt toastiness to it with some subtle smoke impressions followed by dark fruit.  taste follows the nose pretty much to a tee here the main difference for me being the dark fruit note presents itself more prominently; becomes more dominant as the glass warms. there is a small amount of earthy hops on the finish.  light but verging on medium body; roasty and dry finish. the hops show themselves in feel as well they are present in an almost sappy sort of way on the tongue. it is a pleasant addition and adds to the dry finish of this beer.  i love almost everything about this beer. the body is slight heavy and it just so slightly takes away from its drinkability for me. with that being said i’m still enjoying every sip of this beer it’s just my one honest critique.
1533,Dark,4.35,pours a dark cola color with a tight slightly creamy tan head that provides ample lacing. beautiful beer. the nose is led by a bit of smoke cocoa notes and a decided floral hop aroma. wow.  the floral hops are forward and delicious on the taste with the cocoa and subtle roasty/smoky flavor at the back of the palate.  a dry crisp mouthfeel fits the style nicely and makes this subtly nuanced 5.5% abv beer from this iconic brewery a true pleasure to drink.
1534,Dark,4,how could i pass up the #1 schwarzbier?  can at the brewery.  roasty chocolate light smoke some bacon very smooth and creamy. earthy/grassy hops. some caramel. pretty solid but some of the german offerings are a bit better.
1535,Dark,4.29,rocky two-finger beige head. relatively light on the lace through. the color is ruby-brown where bright light passes easily through the center of the glass.  mostly chocolate malt aroma. i get some semisweet chocolate with a touch of chalkiness. theres a the smell of toasted wheat bread in the background. attractive. it approaches the aroma of a porter but comes up just short good for a schwartzbier.  similar to a brown ale but with a little more crispness in the mouth. theres a solid hop presence but the dominating flavor is the aforementioned chocolate malt. the swallow is a pleasant 60-40 blend of the two. i get a smidgen of alcohol in the aftertaste which is surprisingly long and chocolatey.
1536,Dark,4.36,no canning date (purchased at the brewery on 10/7/20 so presumably canned within a week or so of that date); consumed on 11/29/20  pours a deep mahogany/blood-red hue topped with a towering head of fluffy creamy tan foam; good retention leaves a finger of equally creamy cap a massive frothy collar climbing the walls to meet a dense coating of lacing covering the glass.  aroma opens with bready malts meeting a firm minerality atop a solidified underlying yeast character and deep floral hop accents; hints of milk chocolate come through over the middle before deeper heavily toasted brown bread/bread crusts and tones of smoked toffee develop into the close.  taste features a dusting of semi-sweet cocoa contrasting a grassy hop tinge upfront as a yeast profile imbued with delicate malty roast becomes steadily apparent over time; floral earthy hops and spent coffee grounds over the mid-palate give way to a touch of smoke and nuttiness forming into dry cocoa and ashy char on the finish.  mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fluffy higher end carbonation settling to a creamy texture with a subtle oily accent giving way to a steadily encroaching malty grit past the mid-palate; peaking in dryness on the back end the finish is crisp with malty textures and a delicate bitterness.  clean execution at the highest of levels and a commitment to the style in its rawest form; a subtle deluge of minerality accents every aspect of this schwarzbier allowing the malt profile to present both cleanly and quietly detailed with a firm hop presence for a deftly executed american-styled twist.
1537,Dark,4,can shared with todd thanks for the opportunity! dark brown with faint garnet at the edges and a tightly bubbled tan head that slowly dissipates. rich toasty crusty maltiness with hints of chocolate and just enough earthy floral hops to keep it from cloying. nice schwartz!
1538,Dark,4.71,i love a good schwarzbier and this is without a doubt the best one ive ever had. a: poured black with some ruby when held up to the light. had a fluffy three finger tan head that lingered well. a: notes of chocolate roasted malt a bit of smoke and nuttiness along with some spice from the hops. t: rich and layered with chocolate malt sweetness up front along with roasted malts some coffee and some slight bitterness. f: just sublime with a lingering mineralty that hits the spot. the dry finish makes you want to keep drinking. o: this is one of the best lagers i have had and makes me want to try and get more alchemist sooner than later. an amazing beer.
1539,Dark,4.24,l: black with hints of ruby/amber on the edge of the glass. thick foamy head dissipates leaving some moderate lacing.  s: sweet melanoidins and caramel a touch of roast spicy hops and yeast.  t: robust flavors of caramel and roast good breadiness moderate spice from hops and a clean malty finish.  f: medium/light body crisp finish.  overall: a delicious lager definitely good for anyone craving a dark beer on the lighter side. perfect balance of flavors.
1540,Dark,4.44,courtesy of brentk56!!! this is an excellent schwarzbier to have. almost completely black (schwarz as we germans say) with a nice khaki head that has good retention. lively carbonation raising to the top supporting this lovely head. very smooth and full mouthfeel.
1541,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.78,375ml bottle - pours ruby red with a 1.5 finger off-white foam head that dissipates rapidly. on the nose notes of sour cherry are prominent followed by weaker floral notes and oak. on tasting cherry tartness comes to the fore with a gentle sourness that lingers. earthy notes oak and citrus are also evident in an outrageously complex and beautiful beer. great mouthfeel with excellent carbonation and a dry finish.
1542,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.64,bottled: february 2016 drank august 2023.  ruby red and brown cloudy body. rose white head that leaves a thin cap of tight bubbles. nose is cherries hibiscus rose barn wet earth oak and funk. taste is tart cherries lemon oak earthy wet cloth. feel is smooth and effervescent champagne bubbles with soft and semi dry finish.  delicious fruity sour and earthy with some funk.
1543,Kriek 100% Lambic,3.55,kriek 100% lambic bio (2013) - drank in 2023 look - red auburn with fantastic rimming smell and taste - slight tart cherry feel - dry and crisp overall - a little to dry but you still get the tart cherry
1544,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.5,got one from ma che in rome. overall a beautiful representation of the style! very fruity and puckery at first but then the malt back started to appear and balance the sourness.
1545,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.27,bottle from etre bright brick red color with a light opaqueness and a good sized white head with a hint of pink in it. solid earthy funk and lemony lactic tartness with huge cherry aroma flavor and tartness to round it out. this beer is beautiful i wish it were more available.
1546,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.53,750ml bottle poured into tulip. its about goddamn time i found something from this brewery. date on bottle says may of 22.  pours lingerie red with half a finger of pink head that quickly sinks away without leaving lace.  smells incredible. the second i pull the cork the room fills with the smells of cold cherry pie lemon juice muddled stone fruit rustic barnyard hay aromas oaken barrel staves wild blueberries dried vanilla and cookie dough.  tastes of intense lemon black cherries sliced peach and apricot more vanilla oak notes mixed berries faint chocolate and more musty barnyard notes.  feels soft and mild. medium bodied with gentle carbonation. finishes sour.  verdict: vigorously recommended. the work of masters.
1547,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.96,i will not do justice to this beer.  dark red pouring with a white head. retention is ok with some lacing. aroma is off the charts. theres so much going on here. grassy earthy wild funky cherry sweet and tart yeasty. taste - i cant do justice to the flavor. cherry is the flavor but so many shades of it. it is wild funky grassy yeast earthy floral. i get a hint of balsamic vinegar. so much more i just cant put words to. the body is tart full and amazing with a dryness on the back. world class beer here. i am blown away.
1548,Mexican Brunch,4.55,pours jet black like coffee without creamer. little to no carbonation. thin in appearance and feel. the smell is noticeable as soon as cracking the bottle. the taste follows the smell sweet cinnamon and coffee dominate with subtle hints of chocolate. maple is faint but adds a nice sweetness. chiles almost non existent but that’s fine by me. really enjoyable after dinner drink.
1549,Mexican Brunch,4.24,taking brunch south of the boarder kane brewing looks to chili peppers cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.  mexican brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. as a scent of coffee rises first a quick followup of syrup chocolate nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. fully malted and sweet on the tongue high impressions of chocolate caramel maple toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.  as the flavors start to unfold the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy nutty and roasty tone. cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. woodsy earthy and toasty the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.  full bodied and soothing on the finish the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a mexican inspired alcoholic cappuccino.
1550,Mexican Brunch,4.57,500 ml bottle poured into a teku  a- black with a two finger mocha head.  s- chocolate cinnamon some maple coffee some chili pepper very well balanced.  t- chocolate/fudge coffee maple syrup some peppers cinnamon slightly earthy.  m- smooth creamy full body.  o- a very well done and balanced molé stout. easy to drink and a nice kick from the pepper even though it is on the more mild side.
1551,Oculto,1.99,12oz bottle with a fine layer of dust  this is rotgut tequila drop-shotted into a very poor lime-flavored lager. nothing more nothing less.. if youre into that i guess... id only drink this if i was somehow very desperate to be drunk the 6% is hidden well i guess
1552,Oculto,2.79,it sounded good. it looked good even smelled good. the taste was oversweetened lime juicy funk. i had to force myself to finish the six pack. i think i tried pouring tequila in it and adding a lime and that didnt help a damn bit. awful stuff.
1553,Oculto,3.25,“blended with beer aged on tequila barrel staves. blue agave infused.” interesting mixture with definite tequila hints. also tastes like many of the tasty summer brews. the finish could be better. 2015/07/26
1554,Oculto,5,people think this beer sucks...boy you must not be a real beer taster of you cant enjoy the beer. simple things matt and so do flavor. so i your a great beer drinker you find the good in mostly everydrink. unless its a 4 loko those are the worst. ocultos was talking over the top beers. way better than budlight and america beers.
1555,Oculto,4.94,so refreshing i love this beer
1556,Oculto,4.88,i dont know why so many people are leaving horrible reviews. i absolutely loved this beer and think it was genius to brew in tequila barrels. abita brew does the same only with bourbon barrels and those fly off the shelves. perhaps its a cultural thing as most of the people i know who loved it as much as i do were latinos. i wish it wasnt taken off shelves and anheuser-busch would consider putting them back-at least in the high latino community stores.
1557,Punkin Ale,3.5,12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. look is burnt orange tan head falls off to nothing. smell is pumpkin pie spices brown sugar. taste follows with pie spices up front through the sip. mouthfeel is lighter side of medium decent carbonation. overall a one and done for me but not bad.
1558,Punkin Ale,4.96,when i smell a beer this delicious and warming i expect to look at a stout. theres some cloudiness but the nose backs it up. i pick up mostly a dry hop flavour. maybe thats a characteristic of pumpkins that i am not aware of. i was leary of the beer cos i dont like too many added flavors. but it did everything but disappoint.
1559,Punkin Ale,3.66,consumed on: 23 nov 2022 glass: chalice abv: 7% abv serving temp: 51.6 f   look: dark orange-tinted copper. thin off-white fizzy head quickly dissipated to a thin ring-and-islands pattern. lacing is ok.  smell: some light (very light) pumpkin aromas but mostly spices. strong spices. cinnamon dominates along with ginger and some cloves as well. there is a sugary sweetness underlying these other aromas.  taste: follows the nose. the sweetness takes on notes of candi-sugar and really balances out the spice notes. the ginger becomes the dominate spice in the flavor. the pumpkin is far in the background here. nutmeg can be detected in the aftertaste.  feel: crisp but also a tad syrupy. the body is medium-light if that.  overall: i am not a big fan of pumpkin beers but this is one that i dont mind. perhaps because the pumpkin flavor and aroma is quite muted. since i dont drink many pumpkin beers the spices really do jump out at me.
1560,Punkin Ale,5,to me this is basically the perfect beer
1561,Punkin Ale,3.81,pours a pumpkiny orange color with a retentive head.  smells of cinnamon and pumpkin  taste is of pumpkin and sweet malts.  very decent. not very pumpkin heavy.i like it.
1562,Punkin Ale,3.94,overall a very good pumpkin beer. can taste the spices and brown sugar but not overpowering like some pumpkin beers. will buy the beer again though a little pricey in the midwest.
1563,Punkin Ale,3.93,this is a pumpkin beer you can find easily on the east coast. i always recommend this beer for people every pumpkin season. it’s extremely enjoyable. this is a quality pumpkin brew folks.
1564,Punkin Ale,4.06,medium amber pour with an off-white head. it was darker than many pumpkins i have had. the smell is with the typical nutmeg cinnamon and all spices that are typical for pumpkin beer. reminds me of pumpkin pie as i drink it. good very good.
1565,Punkin Ale,4.05,very good. not crazy pumpkin  not too strong
1566,Punkin Ale,4.11,one of the best pumpkin i;ve tryed - great pumpkln and spice flavor without being strong
1567,Black Label Beer,4.5,good cold. like to drink it in the morning.
1568,Black Label Beer,3.5,this was definitely one of the beers that we consumed mass quantities of while we were in high school back in cleveland ohio. i just hope that i gave this beer a decent rating from what i can remember about it besides the name.
1569,Black Label Beer,1.15,$4.99 sixer at some random gas station in toledo ohio. never seen it but it waa priced alright and i am a member of the infamous  gotta try \em all club . well here goes!.  look - golden without a head. woah never seen that in an aal. dead carbonation. welp.  smell - rotten sweaty sock. ahh must be a canadian lager.  taste - solvent and sweat. pesticide riddled corn. mineral water on the back end was at least acceptable.  feel - sticky and the sweetness ascends to ridiculousness. fusel alcohol. makes no sense at the abv. swallow induces a gag.  overall - i drink more aal than any other style. and this shit is downright bad. i dont care what fond memory you had on your fishing trip where your grandpa was throwing this shit back before telling you stories about nam. if you see somebody drinking this slop have an intervention. yuck.
1570,Black Label Beer,3.35,12oz cans stamped may 1319 poured into a hockey skate mug at fridge temp no abv indicated on can. the beer pours bright very light yellow with nearly white head. the head recedes to a single layer of bubbles and leaves a little lacing. the aroma is more corny and vegetable than anything. the taste is corny and wet with a bit of tart. the mouthfeel is thin bodied adequately carbonated and undry in the finish. theres a pronounced buttery/soapy aftertaste and feel that is not altogether inviting. overall not so good. this $8/12 pack takes me back to high school but it will be a short visit.
1571,Black Label Beer,2.35,do not believe it was brewed by pabst when i had it. even pabst couldnt have dragged this one down. the lone highlight if you will is that the beer has some taste. kind of sweet and malty. not poor but only a notch above it.
1572,Black Label Beer,3,pours a pale golden-straw in color and as clear as can be.  not much to go on in the nose or aroma segment. it’s inoffensive neutral and “clean” with malt character dominating the (very low in character anyway) corn syrup. no hop presence whatsoever.  light and somewhat crisp on the first sip. sweetish. as with the nose an inoffensive character with little in the way of malt depth by which anyone might find interest or something to engage in or even to recommend to another lover of characterful lager real ale or craft beer. finish using the dry side for what it’s worth.  “boring and inoffensive” is not the sort of phrase i’d use to recommend a beer to anyone else but in the right circumstances that’s exactly the sort of beer that’s called for and black label fits the bill most of the time.  and it’s cheap too! well a quarter or more higher in price than the lowliest of the low in the malt liquor category (211) but when you’re on a budget and want a brand to relax with but not get crunk on this is a go-to — if you can even find it.*  not recommended for people who have little sense of humor in an increasingly absurd world. for the fact is with taprooms opening on every block in every major city it won’t be long before retailers will refuse to stock rubbish such as this owing to the fact that there’s so much local craft beer in cans nowadays. rejoice motherxxxxxxx!  * (for some reason it’s got a presence in cold boxes in minneapolis and saint paul which was not one of its original markets back when carling and later carling-national moved down from canada to become a big player in the brewing industry in the u.s.a. the glory days of mabel! but i digress.  at any rate the market presence is probably due more to the consolidation of brands and brand swapping that went on when heileman closed and pabst and miller split up some of the available brands.)
1573,Black Label Beer,2.55,well this isnt horrible. it has a definite taste which is saying a lot for an adjunct lager which being a canadian beer might explain that. still it reminds me of a lot of a low level euro lager but not quite as appealing.
1574,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.38,pours a deep dark almost black color with a finger of tan head. the nose and flavor profile are dominated by notes of hersheys chocolate syrup. the mouthfeel is lush and sticky.
1575,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.9,#153 well done!
1576,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,3.8,canned november 2019. pour is as dark as beer comes with a small amount of short-lived head. aroma is better than expected given the age. plenty of cocoa and chocolate with some almost coffee like elements. really nice smelling beer. taste has also held up really well. lots of smooth chocolate. semi-sweet and well balanced with some nice roasted notes. overall pretty good beer. im impressed with how well this has held up.
1577,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.23,drank from a 1 pint can purchased at tree house brewing company charlton ma 2022 served in a tree house brewing company tulip  the beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue. an inch-tall tight and creamy mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick lasting collar. streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass.  the aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. as the beer sat sweet creamy lactose notes appeared. good dose of vanilla as well. chocolate syrup was also noticeable. the sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat.  the flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. malty and robust up front. roasted malts were most apparent. moderate caramel malt presence too. cold coffee was also noticeable. subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. slightly sweet. more roastiness on the back end and the finish. moderate amount of bitterness. some alcohol warmth came through as well.  nice creamy smooth mouthfeel. medium bodied for the style. slightly syrupy. the liquid contained a finer beaded somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate.  all that is and all that ever will be is an enjoyable beer though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat. i feel like many of tree house’s imperial milk stouts definitely suffered in quality when they moved from bottles into cans.
1578,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.66,from the bottle it pours a clear light yellow color with a modest white head that eventually diminishes to a nice ring. some spotty lacing. the nose gets grassy notes not overly pleasant. the mouth gets a light grainy malt flavor.
1579,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,1.56,dec. 2010: 250 ml bottle as buckler 00% brewed by heineken spain. deep golden to pale brown colour moderate white head. typical n/a beer aroma of unhopped wort and cooked vegetables. grainy flavour notes of wort maize and over-cooked vegetables.
1580,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.53,i had this beer at a friends house this evening. he drinks low alcohol beer because he claims regular beer puts him to sleep. this beer may also put you to sleep because it is boring.  pours a clear yellow color with brief white head and light lacing. smell and taste was grassy/ corny. tasted kind of like flat old lager. light watery feel. not something i would drink again except out of politeness.
1581,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.72,pours a light foamy 1 finger head with moderate retention fair soapy lacing crystal clear light pale slight watery color  nose some malt syrup sorghum thing a bit of cereal light floral hop  taste more malt water with light malt syrup sorghum thing hint cereal touch of herbal hop a bit of corn drier gritty finish a mild bitterness  mouth is lighter bod med carb  overall eh not terrible but not good not much going on and quite plane even for na beer likely before the craft na beer movement started
1582,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,4.19,(12 oz bottle best by dec-2021; purchased single off shelf... poured into a 14 oz mug)  l: polished-clear brassy-gold liquid some flecks of sediment; tall tight silken foam stand... the foam holds at first then breaks up after the first sip; leaves a solid ring of lace at the top while keeping a collar till the end  s: mineral herbal-grassy hop?; hint of peppery phenol? rather fresh-baked bready underlying foundation... great expression and intensity overall  t: pretzels and lemon peel; dry finish with a moderate peppery-herbal bitterness which lingers long... aftertaste is quite dry with a toasty pretzel bready essence quietly humming  f: cut dry tight flow; seems like theres a dextrin plumpness to its body up front but it just drops in the finish  o: i would not be disappointed if i had to drink this often... it lacks the bubblegum and clove flourishes ive tasted in other dutch and german nas... not bad! (1746)
1583,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,1.98,well for a low alcohol beer it drinks and tastes like a bud light. good on a hot day or to go with tacos. otherwise not much to write home about.
1584,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.7,12oz bottle poured into a pint  a- pours a clear golden color with a one-finger foamy white head that reduces to a ring around the edge  s- smells of skunk toasted cereal grains a hint of spicy hops. smells like sugar smacks cereal  t- slightly sweet malt up front gives notes of toasted grains and puffed wheat cereal. mid-palate gives notes of cardboard and light skunk. the finish gives just a trace of spicy hops  m- light body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a crisp dry finish  o- pretty well balanced some off-putting notes but drinkable
1585,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3.08,a - light gold color with good head retention on top.  s - aroma is very light. pale malt aroma with just a little bit of hop spiciness.  t - grain flavor with a little bit of spiciness on the back end bitterness is low and the finish is balanced.  m - light medium body with gentle prickly carbonation that gives way to a soft texture.  o - for a non-alcoholic beer its better than i expected. for what it is it hits the mark. would i buy more? to be determined. better than the current score of 2.57? definitely.
1586,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.98,-clear golden bottle pour with minimal foam and light aroma of grassy hops. the flavor is thin but pleasant enough for the style. the finish lacks dryness which would improve the appeal.
1587,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3,from the 12 fl. oz. bottle with as mar-2020 best by date. sampled on june 17 2019.  the appearance is a clear golden color with a fizzy white head the dissipates quickly. great clarity.  barley grains and all spice greet the nose with a hint of floral notes and an overall cleanliness.  the mouthfeel is thin watery and that is to be expected for a n/a beer in my opinion.  there is a sort of nutmeggy barley grain taste and slightly sweet. clean crisp finish. its a n/a beer i could have more than once if i am trying to avoid alcohol.
1588,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.57,good news is this isnt as bitter as other n.a.s out there but this also means not as much flavour. during the summertime i can see how this would be a light refreshing treat. for the other seasons though i may opt for a heartier cooked brew.
1589,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.65,had next to the new heineken zero alcohol and the coors non alcoholic and this was better than the coors and much worse than the heineken more malty and sweet at the end but unlike the coors its a reasonable facsimile to real beer if i let it be. i never drink this kind of thing but i think this one is better than many it has actual flavor at resembles beer and that alone makes it decent in its field. clear and yellowish and thin but it holds its head really well and looks enough like a light lager. some corny sweetness to it even an appreciable yeast aspect its a shame they missed out on any hops because that seems like the easiest of the core ingredients to assimilate into a non alcoholic brew it should at least have a balancing element because without it the beer finishes sugary and one dimensional seems like a missed opportunity to me. very light body even with the sweetness a sort of stale and metallic layer too though high carbonation saves it for me. i would choose this over many of its peers but now that they have the new heineken alcohol free beer this one may take a hit...
1590,DirtWolf,4.91,pours with nice foam and golden color. smells heavenly hoppy and some citrus. complex but awesome taste. smooth and some sweetness at first and awesome hoppiness at the end. definitely my favorite dipa.
1591,DirtWolf,4.29,poured from a twelve ounce bottle the body is an orange-brown. very clear. fluffy white head that creates a ring at the edge. good lacing. nice looking beer.  aroma is a light citrus grass and light pine. a wee note of bread dough.  taste follows nose briefly then a nice hop bitterness. the malt vaguely honey flavored nicely balances this bite and the swallow dries up smoothly. no sign of the abv in the taste but it is most definitely felt.  good mouthfeel as the carbonation is solid and the beer is soft on the palate.  an easy drinking 8.7% beer that i imagine would be fabulous on tap. catch this one fresh as it is an excellent beer.
1592,DirtWolf,4.04,pours a rich deep gold with ample head. smells fairly predictable for the style: herbal hoppy some citrus perhaps. the flavor is herbal hop smack from the first sip bitter the citrus and fruit flavors make their presence as it warms up decent malt and of course it packs a wallop but still reasonable at 8.7% this was my go shelf double ipa for about 2 years but i haven’t seen it out here for several years now and it tastes a little different than i remember but another solid beer from victory cheers!
1593,DirtWolf,5,say no more world-class.
1594,DirtWolf,4.23,best by 9.23  poured into a willi glass at fridge temp  pours a brassy and dark copper with a full creamy and fluffy head. 4.25  i get some sweet and ripe pineapple on the nose as well as some mixed florals. 4.25  taste starts out tropical with some light sweetness to it moves on to bitter pine and associated florals though i think it balanced out nicely as i kept sipping. 4.25  body has a moderate heft carbo is the same and has lingering pine and florals resins. 4  overall a very good dipa that got better and was interesting and dynamic as i imbibed over a half hour and enjoyed the whole time. 4.25
1595,DirtWolf,4.21,with a clear coppery appearance a very hoppy aroma and the taste of hops hitting you from start to finish this is a great dipa for sipping on an relaxing evening.
1596,DirtWolf,4.75,this is good....cant tell you exactly why but me likey!
1597,DirtWolf,4.5,pours a clear gold. thin foam. fruity aroma. juicy hop body. light bitterness. juicy sweet malt finish. great flavor. excellent dipa.
1598,Michelob Light,5,when its fresh its still the best beer ive ever tasted.
1599,Michelob Light,3.29,ended up picking up another mystery 6pk and i found one of these within. i havent had one of these since 2009 and i remember enjoying it for what it was.  l: pours a clear golden with a rocky 2 finger white head that dissipates quickly into a very thin white ring. minimal lacing to be seen.  s: subtly sweet malt bread comes first on the nose with mildly spicy and floral noble hops to follow. fairly pleasant.  t: the flavors follow the nose to a t with the mild malt bread beginning and the mild noble hops finish. i rather enjoy it for the style.  f: medium-light bodied ample carbonation smooth yet finishes short and crisp. easily sessionable. quite refreshing!  o: this is pretty fair offering for a light lager. is it the absolute best of light lagers available? no but it is fair. if i went to a friends house and they offered me this i wouldnt mind having one. it isnt nearly as terrible as many have made it out to be. its great on a hot day and has a great flavor profile albeit a mild one. give it a try while grilling out in the summer heat. its very refreshing.
1600,Michelob Light,4.26,this is a fabulous beer much better than most mass marketed brands. it has way way more taste than other light beers such as bud light or coors light. really it has sort of a premium quality to it. remember weekends were made for michelob.
1601,Michelob Light,5,i think anheuser-busch needs to do away with michelob ultra and start producing more michelob light i heard secondhand they’re going to do away with michelob light that be a huge mistake
1602,Michelob Light,2.89,l: 3.5 golden body with ample carbonation and a sudsy white head s: 2. nothing much to speak of. not pleasant. t: 3.25 pretty sweet. corn syrup. barley. f: 3. medium bodied. heavy mouthfeel for a light lager. o: 3. prefer the original lager but if youre looking for something like it with even less alcohol by volume then this is your best bet.
1603,Michelob Light,5,i hope 5 was the highest rating because i love michelob light! i’ve been drinking it since i began socially drinking. i hope that it will still be available because i’m not a fan of michelob ultra.
1604,Michelob Light,4.33,great beer. drink it as cold as you can get it on a hot 105 degree georgia day cant be beat.
1605,Michelob Light,2.8,12oz bottle coded 21214 poured into a pokal glass at just above fridge temp 4.1% abv per label. the beer pours brilliantly bright pale straw yellow with nearly white head. the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles. the aroma is faint with floral hops and sweet grain. the taste is semisweet pale malt with a pretty quick hit of watery diacetyl and some floral and grassy notes. mild bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a not so dry finish. overall poor. movie butter popcorn is the prevailing note here. soapy and sticky on the tongue. ice cold or with food you may have something but there are way better light beers to enjoy.
1606,Michelob Light,1.77,12oz silver can  so light its almost clear. so light it smells like a glass of water you dipped an ear of corn into. so light it tastes like a water glass with pennies in the bottom. so light... you get the picture  i hate this beer
1607,Busch Beer,3.54,so i’m doing some twerking outside the window of a denny’s when i’m violently tackled—it’s the police—face first into an unopened can of busch. i slide it into one of the spacious pockets of my jncos (50” pipes) just before i’m hoisted upright. just when things are looking grim my best mate gordon blevins slithers out of the pawn shop next door with a fist full of bills and the unmistakable swagger of a man who can now afford cinnabon for dinner.  gordon is brilliant. he convinces the officers that i am just that over-the-moon for a moons over my hammy which is true. he also informs them that i haven’t been quite right since i found out my step-cousin cynfia is having triplets and i might not not be the dad. once i’m out of the cuffs and comfortably seated with my hammy i remember the busch swimming somewhere in the sea of denim below. a little spelunking does the trick and i’m b’s deep in busch.  looks… yeah it got em. have you seen this design? it’s a focking snow-capped mountain range. clamp a clothespin around your nostrils because what it boasts in taste it lacks in scent. like it smells of aunt deberly’s full-coverage underwear i dug out from ‘twixt the futon cushions with my teeth. feels like wet beer. overall i chose a number from the dropdown menu not even remotely commensurate with this beers quality.
1608,Busch Beer,2.72,from a can. i hoped this would have been better than busch light but it really wasnt. i found it to have more flavour but not in a good way half the case ended up being a drain pour.
1609,Busch Beer,1,disgusting. got a good deal on a 12 pack and could only force myself to drink 6. i have low standards for beer and this was disturbingly bad. kind of reminded me of the way raw chicken smells.
1610,Busch Beer,3.06,i expected to hate this. late night beer run in the county and the local corner store had this bud light (never) and keystone among some crappy malt beverages like steel reserve. so i grabbed a quick case of busch. made sure it was nice and cold and cracked one open expecting a funky flat corn water. but instead i was surprised to find and decent cheap adjunct that had nothing negative going on. honestly on a hot day on the farm this seems like it would hit the spot. it’s a pleasant surprise.
1611,Busch Beer,4.74,this isnt some awesome craft beer. but damn is this shit good. easy drinking no after taste. maybe a bit to light. for the price the taste....this shit is great. this should be abs premium beer not bud or bud light.. i dont have the money to spend on craft beers every day. so this is one of my go to beers.
1612,Busch Beer,3.97,this beer is best in a bottle. only places i have seen it sold in bottles is in st louis. since i grew up in st louis busch beer in bottles brings back memories of summer bbqs of grilled pork steaks. its light and is refreshing on hot sticky midwest summer days.
1613,Busch Beer,4.79,pretty much all i drink. cheap and easy going down. like my ex.
1614,Busch Beer,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included.
1615,Busch Beer,4.36,beer snobs stay away. i was once a beer snob. and while i still enjoy craft beer the hot virginia sun and a 7% abv 90 ibu ipa don’t agree with me or each other. enter busch. it’s slightly sweet never skunky completely inoffensive and easy to drink. as far as adjunct lagers go this one doesn’t seem to have any flaws. it is exactly what it is. golden bubbly crisp a little corny and hydrating. this may hurt some feelings but it tastes similar to hamms or pbr but less than them in some weird way. who cares about doing a legit beer review with taste mouthfeel etc. it’s an adjunct lager and a tasty crushable one at that. open up the beer fridge at my house and there is a chance you’ll see something from a local craft brewery or trader joe’s maybe some yuengling budweiser or modelo. but there will always be busch in there. it’s just that good.
1616,Busch Beer,3,havent had an ice cold busch since 1986 and did not expect much so it wasnt as bad as i thought it might be. very light for cheap adjunct lager and not too corny tasting either so thats a plus. fizzy white head is gone in a flash. slightly better than bud maybe but not awful for this type of cheap junk beer. it could be another 35 years before i buy this again. has even less beer flavor than their n/a version! super crusher and no sticky gack stuck in my craw like hamms. hot day slummin pick from the catamount cold cave
1617,Busch Beer,2.5,pours decent  rapidly fading head. i know its not really mistaken for coors products but looking at this can and website this brand really likes to use their mountain backdrop. and the natural light was created to compete with miller lite the retro logo even modeled after it. not surprising though given the og budweiser brand is a parody of the og beer of kings. nontheless this beer is about as average as average gets. id post something about the flavor but its what i would imagine one would experience if they had that covid 19 thing that destroyed so many small businesses. and families. apparently it took your smell away. anyway 4.3 abv busch i think the busch light is 4.1 abv. just funny to note.
1618,Dancing Man,4.49,bottle courtesy of johnnyhops. so good! a lot of banana character. would not have guessed 7.2% either.
1619,Dancing Man,4.01,appearance: pours a clear glowing medium orange color with a moderate white head that sticks around. srm of 8 (3.75)  aroma: strong aromas of bread and spice upfront. there is bread cloves and belgian spices. some coriander and banana before a bready and banana malt backbone.  flavor: strong flavors upfront of sweet bread and bananas. theres cloves and spices. prominent bread malts with yeast and clove spices on the finish.  feel: medium to heavier bodied. good carbonation. finishes with cloves and banana bread that linger pleasantly. balanced. (4.25)  compared to boulevard tank 7 12/12/21: pours a lighter and clearer color with a milder white head. more bread banana and clove spice. less juicyfruit. drinks more malty and smooth.  overall: a very tasty hefeweizen here. i dont get much cinnamon here. yet nice bready banana and clove spices. yet the carbonation comes through here for a nice balanced and clean finish. i think that is what makes this beer drink so well. i enjoyed this one for sure. (final rating: 4.01)
1620,Dancing Man,3.23,12oz glass bottle - review from notes  slight hops and spice cut through but its mostly honey nanners and clove. a little too sweet but still a classic banana hefe - and with a hefty amount of alcohol
1621,Dancing Man,4.5,thanks to bshaw22 i finally had the top 3 hefeweizen of ba this is in my humble opinion one of the best american brewed hefeweizen. i will make it to the brewery some day and have it on tap.
1622,Dancing Man,4.61,l: pours a beautifully cloudy burnished amber and even with a fairly careful pour formed a four-finger head of dense off-white foam. plenty of tiny bubbles visible racing from the bottom.  s: a delightful bouquet of ripe wheat bubblegum clove and white grape.  t: at the risk of redundant repetition delightful seems again apropos. each sip opens with a lovely slurry of clove and banana flavor with some pear and white grape notes developing as it moves across the tongue. by the swallow some light citrusy coriander tones join in and linger alongside the clove for the aftertaste.  f: that is as lush and pillowy as one could want a wheat beer to feel. the phrase cream of what came to mind as a descriptor for this brew\s mouthfeel.  o: that is decidedly impressive for a us brewed hefe. dan clearly picked up a trick or two during his time at ayinger. ill be trying to find this (and bubbler) any time im able to get near wisconsin during the brewing window.
1623,Dancing Man,3,the spice in this one is strong overpowering to the point of being funky. did not really like that.
1624,Dancing Man,4,a good wheat beer. can taste the banana and i believe cinnamon. a tasty and smooth drinking wheat. a bit of of a dryness which i have not tasted in other wheat. definitely a wheat i would buy again.
1625,Dancing Man,3.84,bottle reads e221; consumed on 3/26/21  pours a lightly hazed copper-tinted golden body sporting a rangy effervescence and capped with two fingers of rocky fluffy white foam; good head retention leaves a thin layer of craggy cap a thick frothy collar and broad uniform webs of lacing holding firmly to the walls of the glass.  aroma brings charry bubblegum and firm almost mineralic yeasty spice opening with a distant waft of stone fruit underlying; earthy clove over the middle and subtle banana expanding from a background position across the olfactories is established and direct while sweeter clove evolves to close the bouquet.  taste offers peppery spice and raw clove upfront into subdued yeasty characteristics persisting over the mid-palate toward a decidedly wheaty back end where tinges of earth flaked malts and a slight minerality phase into a wisp of booziness sneaking through the finish.  mouthfeel shows a light body along with a fluffy puff of airy carbonation phasing easily to a crisp wavering consistency appealing to a slightly thinning quenching lightness on the palate eventually firming up on the back end as a taut flaky textures finishes.  while an assertive profile accentuates some classic stylistic touches alongside a slightly more modern earthy twist the booziness remains somewhat apparent across this higher-octane hefeweizen.
1626,Dancing Man,4.24,12oz bottle. etched at bottom edge of bottle is 0203260043738. slightly cloudy deep gold colored body. bit of a gusher upon removing the cap. two fingers of high head after pouring. big burst of effervescence following the pour. leaves behind a few spots of foam. aroma of banana and bit of cloves and cinnamon. taste of banana and spices along with the sharp wheat note. a touch of both sweet and spicy. a flavor of green apple comes in at the end. the yeast esters continue into the aftertaste. medium for mouth feel and for smoothness. the higher abv% delivers a bite. quiet in the mouth with minimal carbonation. easy to drink because of the low carbonation feel in the mouth and the slight dryness that calls for another quaff.
1627,Augustiner Bräu Märzen Bier,4.82,finally able to buy/try this! drove through salzburg to get to italy and had to stop here on a friday afternoon. unfortunately too early for the beer to be enjoyed from the tap but they were selling bottles/cases from the delivery bay of the brewery. date on label of 13.04.2023. great price all things considered. another bummer was that the following wednesday they were releasing their lent bier so i just missed that. will have to return next lent to try that nectar and buy more of the marzen.  speaking of nectar this is the real deal. i had huge expectations and it matched them. so easy drinking yet fulfilling and rich with massive malt flavor. sweet yet perfectly balanced. slight hop presence towards the end of each sip. body feel everything is outstanding. this is what i expected beer to taste like when i arrived in europe. i’m jealous of these monks.
1628,Augustiner Bräu Märzen Bier,4.86,a flawless beer. pretty excellent in the bottle but unreal on tap. a really full taste quite fruity with no bitter lingering taste in the mouth like some märzen. almost banana-y scent and then full bodied and slightly sweet.  have travelled for hours to have this on tap on a whim. if you can get a bottle do so.
1629,Augustiner Bräu Märzen Bier,3.41,drunk directly at the venue from a 05 litre mug. it is a nice smooth marzen better than the ones i am usted to in spain. the venue adds a plus value.
1630,Augustiner Bräu Märzen Bier,4.46,flawless. crystal clear bone white head robust great malt thirst quenching. lends itself to session drinking. finished clean. bottles bought at the source today
1631,Augustiner Bräu Märzen Bier,4.73,one of the best most crushable beers i have ever drank. it’s doesnt hurt that the beer garden at the brewery is one of the most relaxing places. this is a beer is will never forget drinking 5 liters of in a evening.
1632,Augustiner Bräu Märzen Bier,5,no review will do this beer justice. go to salzburg and just drink this beer at the source. it will be one of the greatest beer experiences of your life.
1633,Augustiner Bräu Märzen Bier,3.58,at the kloster mulln beer hall in salzburg may 2014. the weather was chilly and wet and the huge beer garden was empty. unforgettable experience inside. choose a ceramic stein rinse with hot or cold water (or not) pay cashier and get receipt hand receipt to pourer and receive brew. beer comes from a big wooden cask gravity fed but well carbonated since the cask is emptied so quickly.  augustiner maerzen beer tastes better than the typical austrian maerzen. austrian beers were once the classic amber (maerzen) lagers but the ones i tried were continental pils types. augustiner leans more toward bavarian helles.
1634,Augustiner Bräu Märzen Bier,5,there is not much to say about this beer only that it is the greatest beer in the world. it is worth a special trip to salzburg just to try it.  truly legendary.
1635,Keystone Lager,2,keystone played a part in my high school years chasing the bottled taste in a can. unfortunately i can only find the light version distributed around these parts but will snap this up and revisit with an updated review as soon as i fine the regular stuff which apparently still exists.
1636,Keystone Lager,1.94,i had some hope for this one as a buddy claimed it was good. i dont know exactly what i smelled when the can opened but it was not good. unfortunately this overwhelmed everything else about the beer.
1637,Keystone Lager,2.58,keystone as well as the more common keystone light were common around here in the 1990s. now even keystone light is hard to find. would be a good lawn mowing beer if available though.
1638,Keystone Lager,2.62,serving type: 341 ml bottle  a- pours a decent enough looking golden liquid with a sudsy 1 finger white head that dissipates quickly. minimal lacing.  s- sour apples and light grain flavours.  t- distinct flavour of apples and other odd fruit (even vegetable) notes. not tasteful in any way.  m- light body and moderately high (prickly) carbonation.  o- while not the worst beer ive ever had i certainly wouldnt go out of my way to buy keystone. sure its drinkable but thats the only compliment i really have for it.
1639,Breakfast Stout,4.94,amazing taste for a dark stout beer!
1640,Breakfast Stout,5,well well well well well. stout lovers of the world unite and take over.
1641,Breakfast Stout,4.2,had on tap at bulldog saloon lynnwood wa.
1642,Breakfast Stout,3.61,im rating this based off of the kentucky breakfast stout drop beeradvocate says its retired but i just grabbed a pack of them last week. it is sarcastically chocolate perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming. i love this whenever im really in the mood for something rich but any other time its a bit much. great specialty beer.
1643,Breakfast Stout,3.84,almost pure black with a small tan head. the bubbles dissipate pretty fast leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.  very strong coffee smell. there is a hint of chocolate helping to balance things a bit  not surprisingly there is a strong coffee note up front then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. there is a lingering bitterness at the finish.  it is a bit thinner than expected mostly carbonation on the tongue.  i can see how this is the base for the kbs beers it is pretty solid. with so much coffee flavor id consider this a dessert beer. its good but i definitely prefer the kbs variants.
1644,Breakfast Stout,4,pours a great thick black with a nice head that does hang around throughout the drink smells of coffee with a slight sweetness... black coffee with one sugar. has a medium mouth feel tastes of bitter coffee maybe over roasted coffee but does give off a good feeling of a nice early morning cup of joe
1645,Breakfast Stout,4.49,12 ounce bottle poured after warming for 30 minutes into a founders snifter. dark mud coffee black fine dense brown head that recedes slowly. aroma of italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe cubano. a chocolate note too. wickedly tasty leads right off with the coffee. then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth. finishes mildly sweet then slightly bitter and dry. oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness. medium carbonation. overall a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an ‘anytime’ treat.
1646,Breakfast Stout,2.73,i love coffee. i love stouts. i love oatmeal stouts. i usually love coffee stouts. given all that i expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. unfortunately i didn’t. the coffee smell is above average but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. this one is not for me.
1647,Breakfast Stout,4.75,poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.  appearance: very dark brown nearly black with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. moderate lacing.  nose: dark roast stone fruit brown sugar coffee — there’s a lot going on here.  mouthfeel: creamy moderately thick.  attack: dark roast coffee chocolate smooth — plenty going on here too.  finish: alcohol and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.  overall: it’s hard to imagine how an american oatmeal stout could be any better than this — so full smooth and well-balanced. there’s nothing i’d rather drink with biscuits and gravy but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. this beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.
1648,Hop Rod Rye,4.21,packaged 6/7/22.
1649,Hop Rod Rye,4.19,bottle poured into a bear republic brewing co pint glass  a: pours copper brown amber with a frothy tan head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.  s: toasty bready malt rye spice earthy herbal pine floral notes light citrus faint hints of dark fruit and a little toffee sweetness.  t: peppery rye right up front toasty bready malt spicy pine floral notes underlying citrus grapefruit lemon and orange earthy green herbal notes hints of dark fruit and toffee sweetness.  m: just a touch on the fuller side of medium body moderate carbonation. deceptively smooth for an 8%er.  o: could have sworn i reviewed this one at some point but im glad i was able to snap some up. definitely a piece of norcal brewing history. excellent rye ipa!
1650,Hop Rod Rye,4.11,16oz can poured into a new belgium globe.  a: dark ruby red color with lighter orange hues. super healthy head formation and retention. a solid two and a half fingers of cream-coloered head stick around for the duration and leave behind gobs of chunky lacing in a loose ring formation.  s: juiced ruby red grapefruit pine and resin green and spicy hop oils. underlying malt toastiness sharper earthy rye spice and a distinct crystal malt sweetness that brings a touch or berry/candy shell. clean fermentation profile probably chico yeast.  t: opens with a fat crystal malt sweetness. caramel toffee and candy shell. this very quickly gives way to a drying blanket of toastiness flashes of burnt crust and a lot of spicy rye. hop profile hits hard and fast with a lot of vibrant and bitter ruby red grapefruit juice. butter line and resin too along with an oily and green spiciness. bitterness is quite firm. the finish dries quite a bit with long lingering rye spice oily hop bitterness and traces of soot.  m: full bodied with some chewiness and a very round and creamy malt texture. plenty of raking hop astringency too. ample carbonation scrubs firmly.  o: what a throwback. i do think this is the first rye ipa i ever had circa 2008 but i cant remember ever revisiting it before today. i do miss rye beer in general and feel like it got unfairly buried under the sea of west coast and hazy ipas. this particular beer is considered a venerable classic within the rye sub-styles and deservedly so. i love what theyve done with the hop profile: the rye is unabashedly bold and theres some interesting specialty malt character to round things out and create just enough balance to ground the bitterness and spiciness. drinking it bakes me feel like i pulled something special out of the beer archives but in this case i didnt have to blow any dust off of it because it was nice and fresh at my local packie.
1651,Hop Rod Rye,4.15,pours a hazy brown with a small head and light lacing.  smells of malt and caramel.  tastes of toasted semi sweet spicy malt with a slightly bitter alcohol warm finish.  medium body and carbonation. lush smooth mouthfeel.  this is an excellent old-school west coast ipa.
1652,Hop Rod Rye,4.4,from notes 12/15/12: pours a clear hazy deep amber/light brown which clears some as it warms. as the beer settles a small amount of sediment becomes evident. the pour produces a heavy finger of frothy variously bubbled somewhat lasting light tan head that leaves a thin pasty wash of lace. aroma is hop forward earthy floral grapefruit pine with a fruity hint rye bread and rye spice. taste is nicely balanced: earthy grapefruit orange zest pine: caramel malt heavy rye spice and a hint of chocolate. sweet lightly bitter finish with a caramel bitter aftertaste. the 8% abv is well hidden with pleasant warming appearances in the finish and aftertaste. mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation very smooth creamy and rich. very very nice.
1653,Stella Artois,3.12,22 oz bottle acclimated to 40°f and poured into a footed pilsner glass.  pours a clear slightly vibrant yellow gold with a 1.5 finger sudsy head lasting a decent while and leaving about average lacing.  initial aroma is marijuana with cumin oddly enough. smells yeasty and almost salty but really boring else noticable. after agitating i smell a clear bread smell.  initial taste before swallowing is skunky with a mellow sweet yeasty background. after swallowing i get a big hit of breadiness i quite like which dwindles into the aftertaste but remains. appearing somewhere in the middle is a hop presence youd expect from a lager not strong herby being slightly dry and olive green and a little spicy/peppery and floral. through the entire process exists that skunkiness and it just isnt pleasant. its more bitter than i would expect but not enough to slow down my process.  mouthfeel is actually impressive definitely has enough body to it to feel substantial. i dont think id say creamy but theres a little richness seems as though it glides.  overall its about where id expect solid but not great. i must say i was surprised how skinny it was which really subtracted from the experience but the other flavors present were nice. the mouthfeel was pleasant and made it easy to drink where the flavor put me off a little nice average beer id say.  not likely to buy again but i could be convinced if its cheap dont remember how much i paid for it.
1654,Stella Artois,3.91,dont be fooled by its look or its smell (nothing extraordinary there). the canned version of this beer is remarkably smooth without being tasteless. it pairs great with a meal. in my opinion its a solid beer for its price.
1655,Stella Artois,3.76,presentation: 12 ounce bottle poured into a beer stein.  look: light golden color. moderate carbonation. frothy head that lingers longer than expected.  smell: primarily smells grassy and flowery. moderate hops aroma. minor fruity aroma.  taste: it has a well balanced taste with a variety of flavors. it tastes hoppy grassy flowery and even a bit smokey.  feel: smooth velvety mouthfeel.  overall this a good beer. very easy to drink but also flavorful. very refreshing on an hot day. apparently it’s brewed in saint louis and not in belgium now which is sort of disappointing. i would recommend this beer to anyone who’s looking for a flavorful lager without any frills. this beer is easily better than other european import beers and it’s readily available at most stores.
1656,Stella Artois,3.21,25oz can. date code stamp on can bottom - 03may24. clear straw colored body. two fingers of white head and this reduces slowly. leaves behind partial lacing webs. aroma of barley grain malts and floral hops. taste is mild caramel malts and floral/fruity hops with a slight bite. mostly early sweetness with mild bitterness at the end. medium mouth feel. clean finish with some drying. excellent carbonation. has enough flavor to pair with food and provide enhancement but without stepping on toes.
1657,Stella Artois,2.6,look: pale straw colour. smell: barley malt tart smell. taste: mild malty hoppy flavour. feel: refreshing fizz of a lager. overall: bland fizz lager with little to encourage me to buy again.
1658,Stella Artois,3.24,poured from a 25oz can into my guinness glass.  looks golden slightly golden-brown not too yellow. thick fluffy white head that stayed for a while.  smelled that slightly skunky smell that i get on pretty much all lagers. smell got worse with every sip as it warmed eventually getting urine-y. : (  tastes better than it smells. smooth and bready no real top-end crispness but very little bitterness. full in the middle range.  feels smooth too. not overly carbonated.  waaaay better than standard american lagers. i’d happily drink it if it were offered. don’t need to go out of my way for it though.
1659,Stella Artois,3.48,pours a very pretty crystal clear brass color nice very white cohesive head that settles into some clumpy white islands some of which try to cling to the glass in a show of minor lacing. swirling the glass around gives a nice visual as the carb is visible and replenishes the head.  nose is a mix of white bread cracker wafer like light macro lager skunkiness and very light floral leaning hops i would stop short of saying floral though.  the taste is surprisingly refreshing while cold especially has a generic very light maltiness that carries a very minor touch of sweet; reminds me of wonder bread but less doughy; some definite hop presence lightly peppery but they are definitely outshined by the malt. the malty sweet slowly becomes more powerful as this beer warms.  light body slightly effervescent some light sweetness coats the tongue but it finishes surprisingly dry with a low-moderate bitterness; has a nice snappy finish to me. as this beer warms it becomes sweeter and has more of a macro lager taste/feel to it.  im enjoying this beer a lot more than i thought i would have compared to other mass produced euro lager it actually isnt half bad. worth giving a shot in my opinion.
1660,Stella Artois,3.34,smell is overwhelmingly skunk. taste is smooth though and goes down easily. great lawn mowing lager.
1661,Shock Top Belgian White,3,tap hit at a local seafood place. they added a dollar to the value by calling it a ‘craft beer’ lol.. cold and flat in the chilled mug a wedge of orange attached. smells bland but slightly sunny d. taste is ok to rinse a shrimp po’boy down but i’ll not get a refill..
1662,Shock Top Belgian White,3.15,12oz can  on the pour not even 1 finger of average white head formed then in under a minute it completely dissipates. despite that and my clean glass bubbles cling to the side of the glass from excessive carbonation. hazy golden orange body.  aroma is light for the style with hints of citrus but no coriander. a touch metallic with a grainy finish.  taste is decent with some nice but subtle orange flavor right in front of an almost sweet wheaty malty body. a touch doughy. really not bad but not quite a full on belgian wit.  feel is highly carbonated and very refreshing. much better when poured in a glass than when left in the can. at first it seems like its going to be full bodied but the body quickly drops off as a dryness sets in. the wheat flavor stacks around for the finish but this gets light fast. basically a lawnmower beer.  overall this is decent for an ab product but its too expensive for what it is. i dont get any coriander and the orange basically replaces any hop character. not bad to change up the pace from lagers but not something to give a shot if youn are looking for a quality belgian style wit.
1663,Shock Top Belgian White,5,lots of snobs giving shock top a low rating. came to even the scale a bit. its a great refreshing summer beer with citrus. of all the beers to hate on i dont understand why it would be shock top. get yourself a six pack next time youre at the beach or grilling in the back yard.
1664,Shock Top Belgian White,1.42,how in samhain is this still being made? tastes like someone poured a cup of sugar in a blue moon. purely putrid. cheers.
1665,Oude Kriek,4.29,from a bottle season 19|20. cloudy red color with no head. sour cherry smell. medium body and a slick feel. tart cherry and some floral notes with a sour finish. classic example of the style
1666,Oude Kriek,4.3,cloudy purple body; nice initial head on first pour that quickly fades to nearly nothing except a faint circular wisp around the perimeter of the glass. a nice musty fruity aroma; a very faint touch of horse blanket. a wonderfully balanced flavor of cherry sourness low-key alcohol and a touch of earthy woodiness; mild to moderate tartness counterbalanced with a moderate fruit sweetness; a smidge of wheat in the background. medium body; nice mouth puckering tartness not too intense and nicely offsets the cherry sweetness.  this is just an incredible beer. the blending and barrel-aging artfully melds together some great flavors and produces a sublime mouthfeel.  pouring temperature: 49 °f; bottling info: bottling date 10 oct 18 best before 26 oct 28 blend n° 83 · season 17|18 additional info: macerated for 5 months lambics originate from 4 different barrels and 5 different brews
1667,Oude Kriek,4.87,smells like a classy parfume. the aspect remembers the oinopa ponton the wine-dark see that homer sings in the odyssey. the taste became more and more complex and satisfying while i was drinking it. it\s a quite good balance of flavour alcool sour and fruit
1668,Oude Kriek,4.44,blend 32 season 18|19 bottled 1/23/19  it’s funny just last night i had allagash’s coolship cerise an americanized kriek. now it’s time to have an authentic belgian version of the style. i’ve been picking up more of these 3 fonteinen bottles i see on the shelves because they’re pretty much always available for a decent price given what they are and they never disappoint. let’s get into this one  pours a slightly cloudy ruby red with a finger of pinkish white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the cherries are definitely front and center in the nose but there’s a malty vibe that makes it feel like a funky pie. i’m picking up on aromas of sour cherry graham cracker lemon juice wet hay pie crust apple skin buttery oak and light tangerine  it has just as much of a cherry presence in taste but the tartness is even more focused. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting tart black cherry sharp oak wheat bread vanilla juicy strawberry lemon juice and crabapple. the swallow brings notes of tart black cherry pie crust lemon juice wheat bread cinnamon vanilla sharp oak wet hay and light apple skin  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a sharp yet smooth beer. finishes mostly dry and very refreshing  oh yeah this one is great. it goes down ridiculously easy but still has a wild complexity to it
1669,Oude Kriek,4.34,blend n` 71 season 17/18  appearance: clear red color with no head but a few bubbles that quickly disappeared.  smell: moderate barnyard and some tart apple and cherries aromas.  taste: tart cherry notes feature upfront in the flavor profile followed by tart citrus notes and some faint grassy/hay notes. while the cherries are noticeable there is no sweetness observed unlike many fruited wild ales. the beer finish is dry.  mouth-feel: fairly light-bodied with a low level of carbonation appropriate for the style.  overall: a good fruit lambic. the flavor profile incorporates the cherries nicely and comes off very smooth.
1670,Oude Kriek,4.43,bought at bottle craft in san diego ca. $18.99 for 12.7 oz bottle. i remember when i first started drinking craft beer i remember thinking anything over $1 an oz is outrageous. now that still seems pricy but not nearly as outrageous. bottled 6/26/18 consumed 07/04/22. brought in part to celebrate purchasing my first place and for the holiday. i let it warm to probably ~50f before opening.  a&s: i can see from the inside of the bottle that there is going to be a ton of sediment at the bottom. it will be interesting to see how this changes the different aspects of the beer once poured. not very lively when opened. sometimes you get an explosive pop when uncorking this was a mild plunk. without the sediment the beer is translucent almost opaque crimson red. over time this color shifts more towards marron. the head is basically nonexistent although interesting. only when poured is there head but the bubble is large and transparent very unusual looking. a few lazy bubbles of carbonation make their way to the surface. the aroma is surprisingly alcohol forward for being 6.6% abv  t&m: initially without much of the sediment the flavor is super tart. primarily consisting of under-ripped strawberries and cherries upfront. the flavor stays but the tartness decreases over time. semi-dry. the mouthfeel is light and more carbonated than i expected. the taste doesnt linger too long and the beer is not heavy on the tonuge.  overall: pricewise this beer is i think worth it for special situations. i really enjoyed it even with the price consisted. it was a phenomenal example of the lambic - fruit style. close to being on par with fou foune.
1671,Oude Kriek,3.53,375ml bottle poured into tulip.  pours a hazy cherry red with a ring of pink bubbles around the edges of the glass that leaves scattered blobs of foam as it recedes.  smells of sour cherries fresh soil barnyard funk raspberry jam on bread and boozy oak staves.  tastes of cherry vinegar cold cherry pie more breakfast table raspberry jam woody funk moist earth and oaken barrel staves.  feels light and sharp. medium bodied with fizzy carbonation. finishes sour.  verdict: recommended. this is a seriously sour beer. its pretty tasty but make sure you brush well after drinking this fucker or all of your teeth will fall out.
1672,Black Note Stout,4.25,recording my review from memory. i drank this last night but wasnt able to write it up.  12oz bottle my friend drank half and gifted the rest of the bottle for me. he had suggested that we drink it together but our schedules didnt match up and he wanted to crack it open. no bottling date. this is the 2017 vintage so this beer is probably 5 1/2 to 6 years old!  look: pours a very dark brown almost black color with impressive carbonation for a six-year-old bourbon barrel-aged stout. there was a thin brownish-colored head that reduced to a wispy layer. the head regenerates temporarily after swirling the glass.  smell: up front the aromas on this beer (at least at this age) are all umami all the time. it has that rich interesting soy sauce note that is blended with dark chocolate and subtle dried fruit aromas. secondary notes of vanilla and amaretto.  taste: i am really impressed that this beer has aged so well. i was expecting it to be dull and flat. but it is really smooth rich very flavorful. its also really drinkable and there is basically no heat on the palate. the umami flavor is really nice and then the beer has a nice dark chocolate richness. the beer has subtle sweetness and the finish is mildly bitter with nice roasted malt character. the amaretto note is also really nice.  feel: its not thin and its not especially thick either. its somewhere in the middle i would say that it is medium plus bodied. the mouthfeel is nice with soft carbonation.  overall: its very tasty and really enjoyable. ive never had this before. it would be nice to get a fresh batch of this beer and enjoy one every year to see how it develops over time.
1673,Black Note Stout,4.38,amazing no adjunct barrel aged stout. look is black onyx. smell is bourbon chocolate. taste is chocolate bourbon goodness. this is a solid old school legend.
1674,Black Note Stout,4.46,1829 name: black note stout brewery: bells location: comstock mi style: barrel-aged imperial stout date: 10/05/2017 this beer has been on my wants for a long time but i thought i would never get the chance to try it. i was sent this in a box by a fellow beer friend. using a tulip glass i served the beer at 52 degrees. the pour created a one in half finger length head with dismal retention. no lacing was left on the glass after the quick dissipation. charting the color of the beer somewhere around srm 34 dark brown nearly black. the appearance is slightly above average regardless of the head retention. nosing the glass i detected bourbon oak espresso dark chocolate cream oats raisins molasses caramel toasted bread dark roasted malts a hint of char and a notion of floral. sipping the beer i taste bourbon oranges oak resin molasses milk chocolate dark coffee raisins caramel toffee toasted bread crust oats a tinge of soy sauce a hint of maillard and a little smoky char. the mouthfeel is thick and coated. the body is a medium plus has low carbonation and has a delicious finish. this beer held up beautifully. i am pleased to have the opportunity to quaff on this stout. thank you kindly for allowing to have this chance to try a retired beer. simply a fantastic beer!
1675,Black Note Stout,4.37,2016 vintage  another bif beer from @eziel and they only retired beer of the lot. this one was quite the highly regarded beer in its time peaking at roughly #78 overall based on data from the wayback machine. lets see if it can hold up to the barrel aged stouts of today  pours an opaque medium brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  man this packs a boozy punch in the nose for a relatively low 11.2%. im picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon black cherry plum cocoa pwoder fruity coffee toasted oak light tobacco and vanilla  its a bit less fruity and more malt-focused in taste but still just as good. on the front end of the sip im tasting black cherry cocoa powder caramel brown sugar toasted oak sweet bourbon vanilla and lightly burnt coffee. the swallow brings notes of hot bourbon burnt coffee charred oak cocoa powder raisin sweet vanilla toasted hazelnut and caramel  a full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation from the booze resulting in a rich beer. finishes surprisingly dry roasty and balanced by sweeter notes for a shockingly drinkable stout  damn i liked this one more than i had expected to. even at 6 years old this is really good. its too bad they retired this one
1676,Black Note Stout,4.44,12oz bottle into a goblet. 2016 release so 5 years old.  looks superb in the glass. jet black body. generous tan head shrinks to a ring and faint covering impressive given the abv and leaves streaks and spots of lacing.  aroma is wonderfully boozy with a lot of dried dark fruit.  on tasting so smooth. boozy nicely warms the back of the throat. the dried fruit notes add a hint of sweetness.  the mouth is a bit thinner than you might think but it still rolls around the tongue beautifully. finish is a warming smooth booziness with a faint sweet note.  overall delightful sipper of a beer. been after this one for a while so thanks to the mighty sabatinis in exeter pa for releasing a case from the cellar.
1677,Black Note Stout,4.9,#87 good folly miss molly
1678,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.99,nice whiskey barrel flavors compliment a base ale.
1679,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,muddy brown strong ale no head whatsoever and absolutely no more disappointment after that. great silky mouthfeel vanilla flavor mildly allowing bourbon and even brandy notes to overtake it. nice caramel malt finish smooth from top of the glass to the bottom. brandy flavor is more at the top bourbon predominant through last sip. superior effort!
1680,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,2009 vintage courtesy of acurtis. (12 years old!) dark fruits(prune raisins) toffee leather wood slight oxidization. 99% flat. no booziness. smooth. overall: though definitely old this ages pretty well. those melded flavors only age can produce. ages better than most beers out there. from what i’ve read lost abbey was probably flat even when fresh.
1681,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,the angel’s share is from 2016. pours dark dark brown. almost black. very little carbonation during the pour and then a bit after it was all poured. immediate aroma of bourbon. i was surprised it was so strong after 4-5 years. taste follows - big bourbon presence which makes me happy because i love bourbon barrel aged beers. between the color being almost black and the bourbon dominating this is very close to a bourbon barrel aged stout instead of a barleywine. if given in a blind tasing i might think it was. there’s very little barleywine characteristic: it’s not sweet don’t get any caramel or toffee. it’s still a bit boozy but i like that in beers like this.
1682,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.16,viscous opaque garnet-brown with no head; strong bourbon nose with hints of wood cherry stone candy sugar moss plum and oak smoke; fig milk chocolate red currants a whisky hit with a big thread of vanilla sweet comeback + warming end; medium-full chewy round.  3.75 4.5 4 4 4.25  sat on this for 5 years. no looker but smells like a humidor - once you get past the booziness the complexity of the aroma drips down the back of your throat. the taste is dried dark fruit more than any caramel sweetness. and then that bourbon drops in… while among the most harmonious i’ve encountered it does take over more than complement the base beer. not perfect: it’s flat + boozy - hard to avoid at 12.5% but it shouldve mellowed with age. i see lots of good ratings for this but some are a decade old - maybe this beer jumped out more before everything was getting put in barrels. overall this has more in common with treacly english strong ales than anything else. but with a lot of bourbon.  more an advertisement for bourbon barrel aging than a complete beer.
1683,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,cork didnt want to get out no pop. pours dark brown flat. smells bourbon. smooth mouthfeel but could do with some carb. no alcohol to speak of. taste is dry woody with some bice bourbon. bit herbal that old leather tobacco flavour from good barrels
1684,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.31,vintage 2016. poured into a tulip glass. no head to speak of just a full murky ruby brown. aromas of figbarrel and caramel. taste is similar no hops semblance at this point. and that is ...ok. i’ll give you six dollars if you can name where that quote came from. the heft was surprisingly light carbonation low mildly sticky as everything warmed. delicious and coating.
1685,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,vintage 2016 poured from a 375ml corked & caged bottle into a snifter. pours light brown but gathers in the glass a bit darker almost chestnut with the tiniest amount of khaki colored head that dissipates leaving small khaki swirls. nose is a combination of dark fruit figs toffee chocolate vanilla oak and bourbon. taste is a little more oak and bourbon forward followed by sweet toffee and caramel. it suffers from a little oxidation but that’s my own fault for letting this sit so long. mouthfeel is medium to full. it sits on the tongue fairly full then finishes a little thinner. overall pretty stellar bourbon barrel-aged barleywine. need to track down a fresh vintage as it was not my intention to try this for the first time with so much age on it. very much enjoyed it though.
1686,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.43,the bottle the pour and the presentation are fine. however there is an off-putting taste that i can\t quite put my finger on...almost reminds me of eggs?...sour sort of skunky tasting. possibly in and out of refrigeration too many times. the bartender jokingly said cat urine. who knows?. i\m sorry but i do not recommend this beer at all. becks can definitely do better.
1687,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.86,why does this taste so much like tea leaves? isnt this just supposed to be an na lager like heineken 0.0? idk. i realize im not into na beers but i will not be trying this again
1688,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.25,sept. 2002: fizzy straw coloured water with some unpleasant metallic bitterness. i cant believe i actually paid for this. insipid and uninteresting n/a beer.
1689,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.89,had with a meal in germany as there were no real beers in the house and i had never tried an na beer before. frankly it\s a bit bizarre and there\s definitely something missing taste-wise. that being said it\s not bad at all. i just have no desire to drink another one.
1690,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.63,pours a crystal clear golden color. thick 3-4 finger sudsy white head forms on the beer before dissipating. thin layer of velvety foam remains on the top of the beer. aroma has notes of sweet grains a slight skunkiness light herbal hops. again its very reminiscent of a becks.  taste follows the nose with notes of sweet grainy malts a moderate skunkiness that becomes more pronounced as it warms up. there is a very light wortiness to the profile but its very subtle. feel is light crisp easy drinking. bright carbonation.  this is a solid na version of the regular beer.
1691,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.77,this is my entry-level na. i wont purchase sharps odouls or coors edge. if becks na is all the store or restaurant has then ill go with it. it can pair okay with most foods because it doesnt have an overwhelming taste profile.
1692,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.62,pours clear gold in color with one quarter inch head. taste is cereal grain and white sugar. light body moderate carbonation sweet. good for an old school macro style non alcoholic beer. very clean and sessionable.
1693,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.46,pours a translucent pale yellow with a finger of white foam. aroma is dank like walking into a backwoods dispensary dank. aside from the dank is light resiny hops and pale malts but really its just dank. flavor profile is you guessed it hella dank. its dank from top to bottom with a little resiny hops and pale malts for some extra depth. mouth feel is crisp with thin consistency leading to a refreshing sip. overall dank cant be understated here but otherwise a refreshing glass of na beer.  served in a chilled pint from a bottle.
1694,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.83,pours a clear transparent straw colour with very small head and minimal lacing.  smell is pretty unremarkable slightly malty but not much else there.  tastes of slight malts and skinniness but the taste is very faint. tastes like a very watered down version of their regular beer.  not a great na beer. if you’re skimping on the alcohol i’d reach for a higher quality de alcolized brew.
1695,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.27,poured from a bottle - pale yellow straw color with quickly dissipating fluffy white head leaving moderate frosty lacing. looks like fizzy yellow beer.nose is mildly skunky with a faint hint of some unidentifiable smell-moldy grass clippings or decomposing vegetables or spoiled fermenting grain? taste is dilutedwatery and skunky -a weak attempt at capturing what beer tastes like. i dont know why anyone would drink this. terrible.
1696,Boogie Nights,4.25,12 oz can into a weizen glass. pours a very very dark brown with a large foamy tan head than persisted throughout and left lots of sticky lace. slight hint of roasted malt on the nose but not much else. taste is much more potent - the roasted malt is definitely there along with chocolate tart cherries mild hop bitterness and the roobois tea which also seems to smooth out the mouthfeel a fair amount. i like it! i say bring on some more tea-infused beers!
1697,Boogie Nights,4,tasted in a spiegelau wheat glass from a 12 fl oz can on november 3 2018. a seasonal boogie variant for fall featuring the tea you love more and different hops than jungle boogie and some debittered dark wheat for a little roast flavor and color. similar to a west coast black ipa.
1698,Boogie Nights,4,poured into a becher pint glass. the appearance was a semi-dark brown color with a two finger white foamy head that dissolved at a nice pace. some mild lace ran around the glass here and there. the aroma had roibos tea all throughout giving off huge herbal to floral sweetness. mild milk chocolate. the flavor yielded towards the side side of the prior mentioned aromas. mild aftertaste of roibos tea and milk chocolate. the mouthfeel was about medium bodied and extradonarily created a fine in between sort of feel between sipping and sessionable. the roibos tea creates the smoothness but asks a slight hop abrasion but just enough to choke down some of the smoothness. mild finish of roibos tea. overall i like the idea of this beer and would definitely give another chance if i saw it again.
1699,Boogie Nights,4.13,500 ml bottle looks like its batch #276. served in a spiegelau wheat beer glass the beer pours a very dark brown color with at least a couple inch light tan head. head retention and lacing were both pretty good. i like the aroma the brew smells like roobois tea wheat/grainy malt dark berries chocolate and some leafy hops. taste is similar to the aroma but theres also some roastiness noticeable too. also hoppier than i was expecting but thats not a complaint. mouthfeel/body is medium its coating and easy enough to drink. i thought it was a unique and enjoyable brew i liked it! if you like roobois tea then i recommend this one. even if you dont like roobois tea its worth a try.
1700,Boogie Nights,3.8,i like this one for being original but i also like it for being good. i have long been interested in tea in beer i think the potential is only starting to be realized and that we can do a lot more with it than we have so far. rooibos tea is super distinctive one familiar with it could pick it out of almost anywhere and its certainly readily identifyable here in this dark wheat beer which is pretty distinct on its own without the tea too. deep brown in color not overly thick but real frothy on the tan head airy and rising. aroma and flavor feature the tea but its very well integrated with the dark malts which must include some dark wheat as this has an only mildly bitter super fluffy and expansive vibe going on. it almost tastes and feels like it was sparged a little too hot there are some slightly sharp tannins or something in here not quite astringent or tart or anything but there is a slightly weird grain flavor that may or may not have been cultivated on purpose. i kind of like the way it seems to accentuate the earthy floral notes of the tea with some dried red berries and currant flavors coming out too. moderately hoppy to finish but its perfectly cohesive with the tea. delightfully different and easy drinking for its strength!
1701,Boogie Nights,3.17,tart roasty bitter and an absolute assault on the tastebuds- the jungle boogie takes a night out on the town with a darker toasty roasty version that pushes into black ipa territory.  boogie nights billows over the glass with a turbulent pour of eruptive character. honeycomb and tan the beers froth teases the nose with coffee cocoa peppercorn smoke and spice. slim on sweetness a dark candy flavor is short and simple and patiently awaits the full brunt of flavor on the middle palate.  sweetness rapidly drifts and the excessive carbonation carries away the malts with ease. its harsh carbonic bite highlights the taste of burnt toast peppercorn coffee grounds and dry cocoa. charred and tart the middle palate is sharp with roasted currants grape cherry and apple while an acrid taste of ash awaits.  bitter astringent and strongly vinous the taste of dry red wine but with the bitterness of burnt pine decorate the finish while the tannin rich flavor of the beer pangs away at the sides of the tongue. a sour smoky and roasty aftertaste comes as a three headed monster of both complexity and confusion.
1702,Boogie Nights,4.37,i could see this one being divisive but put me on the side of enjoying it. the sweet tea and fruity array from the original with the wheat really go to battle with the roasted malt dark chocolate coffee and earthiness. smell they clash more where taste they fall in line by the charred wheat finish.
1703,Saison Dupont,4.14,serving: 750 ml bottle (“bottled on 01 24 23”) poured into a 14 oz rastal teku glass.  appearance: hazy golden yellow with a rocky head of sudsy white bubbles and clumpy lace.  smell: straw hay black pepper cloves and slight banana on the nose.  taste: straw hop and yeast spice continue atop a clean malt base with subtle grain sweetness refined bitterness and a crisp dry finish.  mouthfeel: light body filled out by lively carbonation.  overall: at once refreshing and drinkable while also deeply complex and characterful.
1704,Saison Dupont,4.44,11.2 oz bottle poured into a chalice glass. hazy blonde color with big white head that lasts for a while. smell is a bit funky hay green apple spicy hop. taste is tart fruity (apples again pear) clove musty. feel is light well carbonated and dry in the finish. the tartness really hits in the back of your tongue. overall outstanding beer that is loaded with character and just hits the spot.
1705,Saison Dupont,3.92,pours a slightly cloudy dark golden color. white fluffy head formation with good retention. spicy banana on the nose. fruity banana clover taste. high carbonation mouthfeel. great rendition of the style!
1706,Saison Dupont,4.04,pours mid amber gold mildly cloudy with some floating sediment. instant aroma of old wood clover and grass. pure farm. taste follows with rich oak and musty leather and barn. full and delicious feel. real character.
1707,Saison Dupont,4.46,this is a unique and funky adventure. hay barn-ass and worker sweat. white pepper and spooky bottom. this is one of take to a martian to taste. i likee.
1708,Saison Dupont,4.03,7/15/23 on tap at apothecary alehouse in morgantown wv.  beautiful head and lacing. cloudy tan amber in color.  aromas.... farmy fresh clover and barn. malt.  high carbonation. clove. definitely finished dry and spicy.
1709,Saison Dupont,4.34,16oz undated can.  pours clear gold with three inches of dense white head. persistent retention with plenty of spongy lacing. clove bubblegum apples wet hay in the nose. light bodied with a soft but crisp mouthfeel. earthy spice and belgian phenols on the palate with honey-drizzled biscuits underneath. clove-studded apples and faint peppercorns. finishes dry and spicy.
1710,Saison Dupont,4.5,poured from a 330ml bottle .  pours a lightish orange  clear with a thick white head that becomes a ring . the smell is full on belgian yeast and very mellow with it and the taste follows suit  that belgian yeast to the fore with a slight orange hint running through and a pleasant light bitterness from almost the beginning of every sip  everything is very well balanced. the mouthfeel is good  mouth coating and creamy light carbonation. overall this is a splendid beer  rich and mellow and rounded on every corner .
1711,Saison Dupont,4.21,pour is a lightly cloudy straw yellow with a dense cap of chalk white fluffy head. great retention. nose is straw hay lemony zest maybe hints of banana/clove? taste follows the nose. hay straw lightly grainy upfront followed by a quick hit of clove lemony zest hint of banana. moderate bitterness. very refreshing. effervescent and crisp; easy to drink.
1712,Black Butte Porter,4.19,an excelent porter! very distict roasted nut flavor and smell. definitely on the better end of the spectrum of this style. kudos
1713,Black Butte Porter,4.58,very nice malty taste. definitely a beer to sip and savor. my favorite porter and its local too!
1714,Black Butte Porter,3.83,decadent dark chocolate malt truffle on the smell. body is largely the same with biting bitter cacao-infused malt followed by mellower milk chocolate truffle and espresso. its a great porter not quite as much a class act as deschutes stout though.
1715,Black Butte Porter,4.34,pours darkest of browns nice light brown head; creamy looking it leaves quickly but a nice persistent film remains; just minor lacing from initial head; nothing after that.  nose is nicely rich roast powdered chocolate light coffee; all present pretty evenly a light fruit skin like twang to it.  taste is so bold yet so drinkable; light dark chocolate with a bite of slightly over-roasted coffee light sweetness with a nice ever so slightly piney finish chocolate lingers in the form of cocoa powder and light roast.  mouthfeel again like the rest of this beer bold at first but just for an instant; quickly becomes incredibly drinkable and almost light; there is nice little bit of hop bite on a finish that is remarkably dry. much like the nose hinted at it has a twang on the finish light light fruit skin like acidity.
1716,Black Butte Porter,4.35,l: pours a dark brown reddishcolor with a small brown tan head and no lacing.  s: a nice roast malt with hints of smoked meat a rich chocolate and a touch of caramel.  t: earthy and roasted malt with some bittersweet chocolate and a medium to stronger bitterness.  f: smooth and medium body.  o: this is a classic and always a good one to have.
1717,Black Butte Porter,4.14,not used to having this on the east coast and ran into this on draft at the capital ale house in harrisonburg va as my wife and i are traveling. i enjoy porters and rip’s and this a very nice porter. i wish i could get it back in maine where i live. oh well got it once.
1718,Black Butte Porter,4.13,12oz bottle packaged 11/16/22 (5 months ago) poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 5.5% abv 30 ibu. the beer pours medium brown with mahogany highlights and khaki colored head. the head recedes to an irregular ring and rocky island. the aroma is mild with black coffee and dark chocolate. the taste is more of the same with the roasted malt being prevalent and the earthy hops following behind with a moderate bitterness. mouthfeel is thin bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. overall very good.
1719,Black Butte Porter,4.25,look: black (nearly opaque deep reddish-brown when held to light) with a tan head.  smell: coffee some dark chocolate and earthy notes.  taste: follows smell. mostly bold bitter coffee not so much of the chocolate sweetness.  feel: medium/full body normal carbonation leaves kind of a dry mouthfeel.  overall: very solid porter pretty easy drinking id say. not as sweet as some ive had but i wasnt too bothered by that.
1720,Black Butte Porter,3.75,was a tad too bitter for my tastes
1721,Black Butte Porter,4.58,an excellent porter from a fine brewery
1722,Black Butte Porter,4.16,12oz bottle poured into a weizen glass at room temp  no discernible bottling date  pours dark black with a fair tan head  incredibly rich chocolate and roasty coffee nose  dark chocolatey sharp and extra creamy  fairly easy drinking and crushable
1723,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1,my friends and i were camping and we were on a budget we saw a 30 pack cans of this for $8.99 it was rape via beverage. the beer looked cheap it smelled awful and it tasted worse. it felt like a dead orphan. this was by far the worst beer any of us had ever experienced. it was so bad we decided rather than drinking it we would use it as target practice. the ammo cost more than the beer. it was the best use of ammo in human history. forget gettysburg. i never thought i would shoot unopened beer cans but it was a joyful catharsis. our souls were cleansed of that evil brew.
1724,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.6,i feel that this is an underrated beer. yes is is one of those beers that one purchases when the budget is tight. however that is what i like about it. when i want something that is highly drinkable and cheap it is on my radar.
1725,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.53,24 ounce can into lager glass canned on 9/10/2018. pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. aromas of cracker corn and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. some fruity corn aromas but not overwhelming. nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. taste of cracker corn and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. light herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough biscuit wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. fairly crisp/clean finishing. very clean on lager flavors not overly fruity/yeasty. light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. thin but not too watery finish. zero warming alcohol for 5.9%. overall this is a pretty good iced pale adjunct lager style. all around good robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. nice clean pale malt/grain showcase with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. not too overdone on adjuncts. a nicely enjoyable offering and well made style example.
1726,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.04,it is what it is. a cheap ice beer with a sweet/sour aftertaste.
1727,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.83,great bear compared to others in its similar category. obviously youre drinking this to save money and get a nice buzz. easy to get down compared to other ice type beers (natty  keystone regular milwaukee)
1728,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.87,12 oz undated can poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp. the beer is very pale golden straw colored with essentially no head or lacing. the aroma is a bit chemical but faint. taste is predominantly bitter with no malt presence. mouthfeel is sharply carbonated with a slight oily/soapy character typical of these beers. overall not good but ive had worse. this can was $.63 as a single so drink it ice cold from the can if you choose.
1729,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,5,best bang for the buck beer bever!
1730,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.57,milwaukee special reserve ice has an initially medium off-white head (which fizzes away much more like a soft drink than a beer) a clear somewhat bubbly straw appearance and no lacing left behind. the aroma is of wet straw and the flavor is of cheap store-brand grape drink wet straw green apple with even a touch of hop bitterness at the back end. mouthfeel is light and milwaukee special reserve ice finishes semi-dry and unappealing. but i was able to choke it down.  rjt
1731,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.02,poured from a 12 oz. can. has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of corn a bit of malts. taste is mild malts some plastics kind of mild flavorless yet unoffensive. feels light in the mouth and overall considering the low price point is about what you can expect from this style.
1732,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.19,save your money folks this isnt worth the time trouble or hassle for you to drink... go with a 40 ounce of mickeys ice or something because this beer is funky tasting.. i seen it in the store and figured id give it a try especially for 2.50 a 6 pack. well the only good note is i had lacing in the glass. the head was thick but quickly went away the smell is grainy and something old..
1733,Fantôme Saison,4.25,pours gold with an average amount of head. smells musty and funky and strong and you know this is gonna be bold for the style. the taste is sour dry and a little bitter at first and then it opens up and you can taste lemon must a little grassy but a prominent distinctive flavor profile. as saisons go this skews a little towards a sour but it has a few things going on that make it interesting and worth a try cheers!
1734,Fantôme Saison,4.16,re-reviewing this one after 12 years since i last had it.  750ml bottle (best before end of 2025) into a tulip. pours a clear golden color with a clean bright head lively carbonation  wow the funky aroma on this is pungent! all the usual descriptors—barnyard wet hay maybe even dank weed—come immediately to mind. super strong but not off-putting at all. just a precursor to the unique flavor in store.  taste is not surprisingly funky and strong. super dry kind of like orval on steroids. grassy acidic with a subtle crushed-aspirin finish. the pale malt and unique yeast strain compete for dominance unified by bitter old world hops (noble? hallertauer? saaz? no idea).  mouthfeel is dominated by the lively carbonation that bites at the palate but gives each sip (or gulp) a crisp clean finish. maybe mouthfeel is where this beer excels most—it’s just so refreshing like champagne.  overall this is just a unique special beer. maybe not one i’d go for every day (and at about $23 iirc i couldn’t afford to) but this one is different from any other saison out there—it’s simply the most saison-y saison on the market. _____________________  previous review (preserved for posterity) 7/22/2011  4.44/5 rdev +4.2% look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 750ml bottle (lot no. b-c best before jan. 2013) - thanks tai4ji2x! - poured into a hennepin glass. watching a replay of le tour de france from earlier today col du galibier and alpe dhuez - happy belated belgian independence day!  slightly hazy straw color with a 1-finger head very minimal carbonation - like almost zero. huh.  aroma is typical saison funk apples pears grass and pepper. nice and bright.  taste is very dry and clean - almost like a white wine. lots of fresh fruit especially white grapes. not picking up any belgian yeasty mustiness just a dry champagne sweetness with a lot fewer bubbles.  mouthfeel is slick oily just great.  now as i get toward the bottom of the second full glass im picking up a bretty tartness - maybe if id cellared this for a year or so there would be more of this.  this saison is extremely drinkable. the only disappointment is the near total lack of carbonation but even that does not significantly detract from the experience.  its hard to believe this beer was made with barley and not grapes. it really blurs the line between beer and wine like nothing else ive tried.
1735,Fantôme Saison,3.89,more of a dry sour saison. not bad but a little sweeter would have pleased this palate more.
1736,Fantôme Saison,4.35,poured into a gulden draak tulip. pours a lightly hazy medium orange/gold with a four finger white head with great retention and thick lacing; looks nice. aroma of grainy malt saison yeast coriander lemon and mild summer herbs. flavor follows with grainy malt saison yeast with a little funk coriander lemon a touch of honey apple hints of light stone fruit; some moderate farmhouse funk in the finish. medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. a great full flavored saison. hits all the basics of the style in yeast light fruit grain and yeast funk. in addition there are wisps of interesting dried fruit and citrus. great flavor progression with coriander and grain up front and fruit developing over time finishing with a drier farmhouse funky bite. dupont saisons are my benchmark for this style and this is as fine or better. this is a really great brewery. so glad they are available again (sporadically) in our area.
1737,Fantôme Saison,4.45,poured from 750ml corked & capped green bottle into my beeradvocate teku. bottle says best by end of 2025 -- i should be good.  appearance: medium golden hue with a bit of haze to the body and a huge effervescence. head is three thick fingers of frothy eggshell foam that leave a nice lace on the glass. im kind of surprised the bottle didnt gush at all given the huge effervescence and persistent head!  smell: funky malt with a bit of a spicy character and even just a hint of sourness. classic refined and subtle -- good stuff.  taste: nice light malt a little fruity-phenolic character (but not too much!) a little bite some good bitterness ... this is a damn fine saison. damn fine indeed.  mouthfeel: medium body with a big carbonation and just massive creaminess. i love it -- with just a little more body it might be perfect but its very very good as it is.  overall: i knew this beer was going to be above-average for sure. but ive had fantôme beers in a green bottle before and was underwhelmed. thankfully this one appears to have been treated right and it is a treat indeed.
1738,Fantôme Saison,4.49,i am so happy i finally got to have this beer! wonderful beer! so smooth and full bodied. funky and sweet great taste! nice hoppy bitterness. lemony and spicy. poured from a bottle into a tumbler. beautiful foamy creamy head atop a hazy golden yellow body. excellent curtain lacing. hope to get more!
1739,Fantôme Saison,4.28,750ml green bottle. corked and capped. mostly clear pale gold colored body. lots of pillowy white head; it takes a few pours to get a full glass. keeps the foam as the beer is consumed. aroma is clear with belgian yeast with green apple and citrus. taste is similar to a champagne but with more yeast (slightly sour but in a good way). citrus and pear. long fade out in the aftertaste. medium mouth feel with some effervescence. hints at dryness but this is from the yeast. very expressive carbonation. thirst quenching and has that yeast bite. yummy.
1740,Fantôme Saison,4.31,750 ml bottle poured into a tulip  a- a hazy golden copper with a large fluffy white head.  s- wonderfully funky apricots pears some oak musty cloves earthy spices some lemon zest touch of wheat.  t- funky musty pears some wheat hints of apricots cloves earthy spices touch of lemon zest.  m- smooth lively carbonation light body.  o- best fantôme bottle i’ve gotten so far taste doesn’t live up to the nose but still a great saison that gets better as you drink it.
1741,Devil Over A Barrel,4.17,2014 vintage; drank 9/30/14 @ the bad apple.  brown/black hue.  tan head; decent lace.  roasted coffee beans & milk chocolate nose.  medium thick mouthfeel.  milk chocolate flavor with mild coffee bean flavor; spice heat on the lips.  i bet this was amazing fresh....
1742,Devil Over A Barrel,3.92,this one pours a fairly dark black color with a small head and not much lacing.  this smells roasted coffee beans and espresso milk chocolate oak smoke and bourbon with a touch of a vegetal aroma.  this is solid up front but theres this odd and stale vegetal taste on the back end that seems to be the beginnings of the coffee turning towards the dreaded green pepper phase. fortunately up front the coffee flavor is nice lightly smokey and roasty a nice chocolatey porter base. theres a little bit of bourbon and its melded into the flavor nicely and doesnt dominate or stick out too boozily.  this is medium bodied fairly creamy and surprisingly rich for the abv and style. its fairly drinkable.  this has a slight off-flavor on the back end but its otherwise a solid beer.
1743,Devil Over A Barrel,4.34,what do you do when you are awash in beer & tavour keeps sending more? hold everything in abeyance on station until late night new beer sunday (lnnbs) (week 711)!  from the bottle: sinful …; brand: devil over a barrel[] style: imperial oatmeal porter brewed with coffee beans & aged in bourbon barrels[] statement of composition: 60% porter brewed with coffee beans and aged in bourbon barrels 40% porter brewed with coffee beans; brewers gone wild! a series of big bold ballsy beers.  i am up late (or early) & now it is time for some coffee! i pop!ped the cap & began a c-line pour into the awaiting glass. i was dissatisfied with its initial production of head so i performed a vigorous in-glass swirl to raise just under two fingers of dense foamy rocky deep-tan/light-brown head with moderate retention leaving loads of lacing in its wake. color was black/opaque (srm = 44) allowing zero light penetration. nose was redolent with coffee & it was like i was mansplaining on f night - porters might be close to stouts but they do have differences & porters often recieve adjuncts as a result of their receptiveness coffee & fruits being the most prevalent. the nose also had a light wafting of coconut which i now recognize as bourbon-bbl. aging. mouthfeel was medium-to-full not quite creamy but close. i allowed it to warm in my mouth on my tongue & coating my palate all bringing out a rich bourbon flavor underlain by dark black coffee! mmm. cigars with coffee infused with a shot of bourbon on the fantail of the sdts ... i was not happy with my shore duty assignment to an underway vessel but being that it was mostly silly-vilians things were more relaxed. this beer was evocative of those evenings anchored or moored in the lee sides of the channel islands. i no longer smokes cigars thanks to adult-onset asthma but i miss the heck out of them especially when drinking something like this. i have never been a huge fan of bourbon preferring the minty spiciness of rye but beer seems to love being aged in bourbon bbls. in turn i love the aged beer finish was dry and boozy but that was okay by me since they copped to it on the label. i just dislike getting blindsided.
1744,Devil Over A Barrel,4.11,deep dark brown body; dense creamy light tan head. roasted grain scent; some coffee elements. rich chocolate flavor enhanced with notes of coffee; a bit sweet a bit bitter; very slight presence of alcohol. smooth and creamy texture on the palate; deep sweetness offset with charred grain dryness.  a rich and complex beer lots of layers of flavor.
1745,Devil Over A Barrel,4.3,poured from a 12oz bottle into a speiglau ba glass.  look is completely opaque black with zero highlights and a thin tan head.  arom is rich roasted chocolate with a hint of bourbon.  with the taste you get each of the individual flavors chocolate coffee and bourbon.  delicious.
1746,Achel Trappist Extra,4.1,750ml bottle into a tulip best by october 2020 so a bit late. will it matter? (spoiler alert it didnt).  looks great dark reddish brown body with a persistent off white head. the nose promises bags of dark fruit but the taste doesnt quite deliver. very smooth and certainly enjoyable.
1747,Achel Trappist Extra,5,bottling date still fairly fresh as cellar ales go (autumn 2022 i believe). an uneventful pry of the cap am greeted with welcoming sweet bready bakery smells. pour (into globular 15 cl snifter) issues a bubbly pinky-finger tan cap which recedes rather quickly but lingers with a dormant-but-gurgling surface activity and the obligatorily persistent flank of dense microbubbles surrounding the fill line. color an enchanting semi-translucent ruby-brown with no noticeable particles having a swim. nose after pour validates those first impressions of the newly-opened bottle - bready yeasts raisins a certain dankness other complexities that i dont wish to overstudy. into the mouth feels rather effervescent telegraphing those first-perceived scents to the palate maybe a slightly bitter and sour character is ascertained. for nuanced complexity and balance/synergy this delivers. swallow brings it on home smoothly tangy delicious as it descends.  in summary i dont know if i could even tell this apart from a revered ol st b 12 (or eek a... westie?) if conducting a blind comparison. which hey that gives me an idea...
1748,Achel Trappist Extra,4.5,rerate 750 ml green bottle as trappist achel bruin bier extra probably from vinmonopolet. brown colour huge off-white to beige head. vinous aroma notes of dark dried fruits brown kandij sugar oak old dry sherry. oaky and medium sweet flavour with a dry finish. again notes of dried figs brown kandij sugar and old and medium dry sherry. a hoppy and oaky bite in the finish.  original rating: bottle at den tatoverede enke copenhagen. brown colour. vinous and oaky aroma and flavour of old dry sherry even cognac / armagnac. a top notch beer!
1749,Achel Trappist Extra,4.66,dark brown with some red not too much foam. lots of raisins and figs vanilla sweet aroma. tastes reasonably sweet with flavors following the nose. some creamy thick mouthfeel though drinks smoothly. extremely pleasant.  lovely quad (im treating this as a quad if you want to open the bjcp pandoras box and belgian dark strong ale vs quad discussion). it certainly does not have to hide itself against the likes of st bernardus / rochefort / westvleteren though misses their complexity by a tiny bit.
1750,Achel Trappist Extra,4.5,poured from 750ml bottle into chimay goblet.  l - dark golden brown pour sandy taupe head which dissipates quickly.  s - malt slight metallic note buttery brown bread.  t - syrupy treacle sweetness dark bready grains. sweetness is cut by a vegetal (fennel) bitterness.  f - not over thin fine carbonation with a dry finish.  an excellent example of the style. do wish the taste was a slightly better match to the smell.
1751,Achel Trappist Extra,4.6,actually thought this was their tripel so i was was surprised by the dark brown pour - very creamy tan head with a nicely fuzzy persistence... its almost like a quad but not as sweet and thick - has a fluffy carbonation and a lot of quad-like elements of spice and fruit but dried out and toned down to something almost umami... theres some wood and bitter char and smoke amid the dates and dark fruited bread impressions... lots of complexity and depth... smooth and dangerously drinkable - this 750 ml bottle isnt going to last long - very impressed - highly recommended for fans of quads strong belgian darks belgian and fine ales in general - as well as all true bas...  trappist monks: this is how you do this...
1752,Achel Trappist Extra,4.6,look: it pours dark brown with a tan head. head retention is very good. it is clear for the most part.  smell: strong rich malty aroma with raisins. there are some dried cherry notes a very low spice and and very light vanilla.  taste: it is malty rich with bread and raisin flavors. there are dried cherries at moderate levels with a light spice and perfume.  feel: it has a full body and is quite dry in the finish. there is alcohol warming at pleasant levels.  overall a great blend of flavors and aromas.
1753,Achel Trappist Extra,4.28,750ml bottle. no dating found. green bottle imported by shelton bros. body color is a plum brown with cloudiness. minimal head. no lacing. aroma is dark fruit raisin molasses dark bread and candi sugar. taste is dark fruit raisin prune and fig chocolate and vanilla molasses and toffee. the dark fruit rules supreme in the aftertaste but expresses slightly sweet. heavier mouth feel with some syrup. very little carbonation from this bottle. beguiling beer that tastes rich and dense with flavors. i bought this at a bottle shop that stocks very few belgian beers so it would be helpful to know the age of the beer considering the lack of carbonation.
1754,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.68,a decent light beer.
1755,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.04,12 oz green bottle  clear golden color foamy white head. mild sweet grainy aroma. taste is bland and watery. super thin bodied. not a bad flavor just no flavor.
1756,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.45,pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a white foamy/creamy head. smell is barely perceptible very mild earth/grassy scent. taste is mostly a clean malt profile with a somewhat weak hop bite. feels well carbonated thin bodied. mildly astringent. finishes dry. overall it is what it is- for a light lager it is as good as amstel in my opinion better than the macro brew light beers- only 3.3 % abv. after reviewing this amstel and heineken are both macro  i meant american macro breweries.
1757,Heineken Premium Light Lager,1.22,god awful nasty! this beer has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. id rather drink mule piss. took 2 sips and drain poured it poor drain. sorry. probably should have flushed it instead. pale off clear with no head sour/skunky/putrid smell. who drinks this crap and enjoys it. at least have an amstel light. not much better but ... better.
1758,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.07,so this is pretty ass no two ways about it. they used to have that guy from that show that was also ass and the ad would be on all the time. they said it was like the best ranked light beer or something but this is just dutch river water scooped out of the holland canals. gross. first time i had this was at a billiards/ping pong kinda arcade bar on the second floor (my first mistake) in new orleans like 5 years ago. it was piss then and i didn’t even really drink beer at the time. now it’s plan undrinkable to me an frankly i love the regular heineken. it’s a great lager with good crisp taste. this? this is flat pungent skunk water. it’s heineken but it’s like been run through the drink dispenser hose at the bar. sorta kinda tastes like something you know to be orange juice but you know it’s sourced from concentrate. that’s this. heineken that’s been watered down run through a dirty fire hose and a skunk’s ass then bottled. steer clear my friends.
1759,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.31,green bottle into glass  this is waay better on-tap but is decent out tha bottle too. cleaner and lighter than the og but with about the same hops which is a win in my book  an ok terrible beer
1760,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.03,poured from a can into a sam adams glass  l: pours a crystal clear pale gold. white head fades to a ring of bubbles quickly. s: inoffensive euro lager without the skunk smell. the can really helps. t: like a crisper cleaner heineken. watery but it works. f: dry and effervescent. o: disagree with the awful rating. this is a 90 calorie beer with 3.3% abv. rate it for what it is. really nice for after work or a session.
1761,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.87,pouring this is a must. dont just drink out of a can or bottle. beautiful color and excellent head retention make this a beauty on your table or desk or wherever youre enjoying it. the smell of hazelnut and chocolate hit you every sip. the taste is so rich but not overpowering. great taste of the malt and hops mix perfectly. a weird side note: this beer is still damn good even if your glass gets a little warm.
1762,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.28,an overall lovely ale with a slightly stronger taste of malt than i would prefer and slightly less sweet than i feel it should be for that perfect balance. really glad to have tried it and would like to have it on draft someday.
1763,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,2.8,pours dark brown with caramel foam. no obvious scent. tastes of nuts and brown sugar with quick finish. average beer at best.
1764,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.53,12 oz. can canned 03/08/22.  poured to a duvel snifter. pours a dark ruby body some bubbles show when held to the light. thick finger of frothy khaki-tan head that leaves good spotty lacing. aroma is pleasantly toasty & nutty. definitely invokes an authentic sense of earth / nuts / peanut / hazelnut. slightly minerally / metallic. flavor profile has some muddled notes to it: earthy herbal bitter with notes of dark fruits (cherries figs dates). almost retains a tart cherry juice sort of quality not sure if this is due to the age of the beer or what. hazelnut is not exactly the main player here if you ask me. does retain some earthy nuttiness (peanut hazelnut) but tastes more earthy & herbal & hoppy than anything else. not as roasty as expected. feel is smooth crisp fairly easy-drinking. carbonation is good.  overall a middle of the road offering from rogue in my opinion. surprised to see that this beer has such high ratings here on the site.  rogue hazelnut brown nectar -----3.5/5
1765,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.75,medium brown to dark caramel in color with a caramel beige head that briefly flashes and dissipates. very nutty in taste and aroma. a good brown ale with lots of hazlenut notes pretty simple otherwise.
1766,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.23,nothing to write home about. a funny combination of simple flavors with a limp finish. hazelnut taste is good but not very present.
1767,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.76,dark brown mostly transparent brown head slowly dissipates and leaves nice lacing. nutty odor on nose. hazelnut flavor is present as is a pungent flavor i don’t really like. feel is average. it’s ok but i don’t want it again.
1768,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.07,from a can into a pint glass. pour has a vibrant slowly receding head of light biege foam that tops a fantastic amber brown body that is generally clear but with uniform particulate throughout. scent has the pretty typical nuttiness of a brown ale with sweeter notes of toffee and hazelnut rounding it out (and almost wholly avoiding the sometimes bitter scents of a brown ale). taste is an incredibly well balanced blend of subtle nuttiness and hazelnut with a just a smidge of bitterness peeking out. feel is very smooth with a pleasant aftertaste that follows the taste well. an all around excellent fall beer that is very very drinkable.
1769,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.26,this one i really like.  poured a deep reddish auburn with a tan head that didnt last that long but overall it still looked good in the glass.  aroma and taste lived up to the hazelnut hype and even the nectar part as the feel was a bit thick and went down with a great deal of satisfaction.  this one had a nice complexity between hops malt and hazelnut. i will absolutely buy it again. it was also nice to have an english brown ale as this style is not very common in south tx
1770,Goose IPA,4.15,pours a light copper and straw. extremely clear. pure white head that laces really well. very rocky with multiple sized bubbles.  smells of light citrus pine and malt sweetness. some kind of candy flavor that i cant pinpoint.  tastes like an old school ipa with classic c hops. pine and grapefruit. just enough malt backbone to balance it out. a little grassiness in the finish that follows with a really nice crisp bitterness to finish it off. a little bit of chrw to the beer as it finishes.  mouthfeel is a little chewy strong carbonation and a little slick.  i really like this. not an over the top ipa but a very nice balanced and delicious ipa that i will buy again.
1771,Goose IPA,3.92,nice crisp refreshing medium light mildly bitter west coast ipa.
1772,Goose IPA,5,on tap in terminal 4 at bwi airport rr seafood bar. $9.50 for a 20 ounce draft. beer had a great smooth taste and overall feel. would definitely get it again in future.
1773,Goose IPA,3.61,one can recognize the adherence to the style of the english style ipas which i do respect. however (i often have grapefruit for breakfast)  ss . . grapefruit beer in the evening. ? well . ..a bit repetitive . ) still an ok overall well constructed beer; a nice drinkable crisp ipa.
1774,Goose IPA,2.97,nice orange color with a copious persistent head. but aroma was minimal. hop flavor was one-dimensional mostly bitter with a hint of umami. light to medium bodied.  to me an ipa should have at least 6% abv. this one falls a little short. it looks like an ipa and thats about all.
1775,Goose IPA,4.07,look: pretty foamy top smell: very clean pleasant floral aroma. the smell reminds me of jasmine tea. taste: the first several sip is interesting. it has bitterness and a floral taste. the after taste is not that interesting.
1776,Michelob Golden Draft,3.49,from a can. this is one of those beers where the light version tastes better than the heavy. pours a beautiful colour but thats where things end. taste is too meh not great but could be worse i suppose.
1777,Michelob Golden Draft,3.57,drank from a 12 ounce can. scores are based on the style.  look - would much prefer if the can was full blue or full silver the gradient isn\t doing it for me. that said the circular seal is nice and the emphasis on golden draws in the eyes. the minnesota shaped barcode is a neat touch too.  smell - i cant quite describe the experience of this beer hitting my nose. the smell gets you from a good distance away but its the smell of nearly nothing. its like a diamond plate floor covered in sticky beer residue. very metallic and mildly sweet.  taste - thankfully the taste is much more interesting than the smell. its a comforting flavor too. even though ive never had this beer before it tastes like tailgating like being in a trailer at the racetrack like going to a concert at the county fair. this tastes like public gatherings. or more realistically its a fine balance of malty and earthy. not too sweet not too bitter. an exemplary aal.  feel - this beer feels perfectly matched to its taste. medium-thin body with just enough back-of-tongue sparkle to it.  overall - i definitely prefer this to the light version but the light version is probably objectively better for a full day of parking lot drinking. however at home im much more comfortable with the full weight. its tasty its easy its relaxing and i can confidently say that i like it.
1778,Michelob Golden Draft,3.8,why is this beer so hard to find?????
1779,Michelob Golden Draft,3.21,it is what it is
1780,Michelob Golden Draft,3.04,i cant find this one around central wi golden light is everywhere. i pick ups 12pk every time i visit family in mn. it is a nice change in my regular adjunct lager rotation. nothing special just a good beer.
1781,Michelob Golden Draft,3.05,got to try this when working in minnesota in 2002.not a bad beerand the locals consumed it like water.seems ab would sell this outside the midwestas not available in the southwest.overallfairly decent offering
1782,Michelob Golden Draft,5,i believe this is the smoothest tasting brew so far out of all michelob products. it leaves no bitter after taste. very smooth body and flavor. good job!
1783,Michelob Golden Draft,4.15,i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed several cans of michelob golden draft at a recent trivia night fundraiser for my kids school. it was much better than the other beers offered including pbr and budweiser. i just wish i could find it in stores as all i can seem to find is golden light.
1784,Michelob Golden Draft,3.81,by some insane indiana state law it was (is?) illegal to buy alcohol except in bars and restaurants on sunday. i remember that this one came out the first sunday that i was in grad school at purdue. since i couldn\t take a six-pack back to the dorm with me i sat in the local bar not too far off campus drank a few pitchers of this then went to the free showing of alladin on campus taking many pee breaks. oh those youthful magic moments.
1785,Bad Boy,4.68,pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and lacing aroma has generous floral and hoppy hints the taste follows the nose with a very well balanced floral and hoppy flavors a medium bodied well carbonated beer a great ipa
1786,Bad Boy,4.9,#82 hits on all levels
1787,Bad Boy,4.5,from a month-old pint can pours a very clear deep orange-gold. smell and taste are very herbal and piney with a touch of citrus. bracing bitterness but not excessively so. a big unapologetic west coast iipa. fantastic beer.
1788,Supra Deluxe,3.34,pours clear light bright yellow with a thick pillow of white for a head. decent lacing. aroma is faint citrus and biscuit. flavor follows the nose lemon and biscuit with very little bite in the finish. feel is light and well carbonated. overall not a lot to it. fine as a thirst killer without much flavor.
1789,Supra Deluxe,4.1,19.2 oz can stamped fat magic 4/11/23 into a tall 20 oz lager glass. l: pours straw light yellow with a rocky 1/4 off white head that has ok retention large steady long-lasting carbo bubbles light spotty lacing. s: lime citrus pith light bready malts very lightly fruity a hint of yeasty biscuit. t: lime malts salt yeast white grape citrus zest & pith cracker/biscuit notes. has a light citrus zest linger and a bready aftertaste. f: lightly crisp med-light body with a fairly fast clean dry finish. o: the pilsner malt tastes are very good here and all is well balanced btwx citrus & sea salt. a nice lager still with the additions. it gains quenching status with its dry finish and is ez drinking. simple tasty and outstanding. ill get it again as it is local to me.
1790,Supra Deluxe,5,this beer rules
1791,Supra Deluxe,3.95,appearance: pours a completely clear light golden-yellow color with a strong white head. srm of 6-7. (4.00)  aroma: strong aromas of rice some floral notes. some sake. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of rice grains some floral and sake flavors. floral with sake on the finish. not too sweet. (4.00)  feel: medium-bodied strong carbonation. finish is floral and somewhat yeasty. full. (4.00)  overall: my first rice lager here. this one drinks well and i really like the addition of the floral hoppiness which i think provides a nice and somewhat necessary aspect to this beer. without it it would be too flat like sake. i think i prefer grain rather than rice malt beers but still this is nicely done. (rating: 3.95)
1792,Supra Deluxe,3.99,l: pale straw with a bit of a white head. lively carbonation.  s: bready malt light hops  t: more hop forward than the nose. hoppier than most rice lagers which makes it more interesting. not so hoppy it’s overpowering.  f: light effervescent clean  o: excellent rice lager. i’m a huge fan of this style when done well.
1793,Supra Deluxe,4.29,mostly clear yellow body though some swirling cloudiness that catches the eye big white head with spotted lacing. rice and herbal hops dance around intense lemon with moderate orange zest and a hint of green tea. taste is pretty much the same lemon carries the finish. feel leans hoppier for style but rice is never lost and the feel is still decently dry and elevated. is it the best rice lager i have had? no but it is up there
1794,Supra Deluxe,5,dry crisp premium
1795,Supra Deluxe,3.9,draught pale gold appearance. slightly sweet very light spiced malt aroma. good medium light toasted malt flavor with just a bit of a floral noble hop bite. the finish ups the rating with a toned down pilsner flavor.
1796,Supra Deluxe,3.88,16oz can into a pint glass. no freshness dating.  looks excellent in the glass. faintly hazy pale yellow body. big bright white fluffy head persists in good form throughout leaving layers of lacing.  grassy barnyard malty aroma.  on tasting smooth malty slightly sweet with a good restrained hop bitterness at the end.  mouth above medium a little foamy. finish on the bitter side and a touch metallic.  overall good lager nice balance slightly spoiled by the metallic touch.
1797,Racer X Double IPA,3.96,a: crystal clear; copper in color; 1 finger finely pored light tan head that receded to a wispy cap; nice rings of lace;  s: very ripe pineapple;  t: follows the nose up front and at the end; in the middle theres an added floral component; mild bitterness on the finish;  m: medium to full bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish;  o: a little too sweet for my taste;
1798,Racer X Double IPA,4.68,on tap. pours with a clear copper with creamy tan foam. moderate retention excellent lacing. very malty aroma with caramel and lemon hoppy notes. malt backbone carries strong grapefruit golden caramel and grahm cracker flavors running into a pleasantly bitter finish.  so nice to run into a west coast brew in the the overwhelming neipa market. a truly superb ale with outstanding balance. drinks dangerously well and going back for another sip before they run out!
1799,Racer X Double IPA,4.25,reminded of this beer by the how many beers of fame have you reviewed? post. surprised that i had not reviewed this before have had several times. this is a great brew dont think that it is distributed in ma anymore?
1800,Racer X Double IPA,4.25,bb: 04/11/21 consumed: 02/02/21  l: pours a pale to medium amber with a medium chill haze. an aggressive pour yields a nice off-white 2 fingers of head. it has ok retention but whats left is sticky and leaves nice webs of lacing as the beer recedes in the glass.  s: citrus rind (grapefruit?) citrus pulp (orange?) a bit of pine and prominent caramel malt.  t: this is a hop bomb all right! i get blood orange on the front end flowing into the mid palate where it mixes with sweet caramel malt and sweet valencia orange. the caramel malt continues and mixes with waves of pine resin bitterness on the finish. at first blush the sweetness is being balanced very well by the bitter finish but as the beer warms the sweetness starts to win.  f: medium-full body with medium-light carbonation. the mouthfeel is creamy and a bit sticky with a dry finish.  o: this beer takes a bat made entirely of hops and smacks you in the face while simultaneously shanking you with a sharp malt shiv....old school to say the least. to me it is actually closer to some of the proto-neipas or what we used to call east-coast ipas; i.e. a nice strong bitterness moderately sweet and a nice dry finish. to me though this is a bit sweeter than an east-coast ipa. as the beer warms it becomes a bit more unbalanced as the sweetness starts to become more prominent in both the nose and palate. for me that detracts from the palate more so than the nose and it loses .25 to .5 in the taste column as a result. as it warms it is not as balanced as it\s younger sibling. either way this is a great ipa and a safe harbor in a locust reign of neipas. you should try it if you get a chance.
1801,Racer X Double IPA,4.59,16oz can best by 4/11/21 into a gandhi-bot tulip.  l: pours a clear striking copper body beneath two fingers of dense creamy tan foam. moderate retention excellent lacing. beautifully old-school.  s: balanced aroma of caramel malts and citrusy hops. simple and classic.  t: the taste takes me straight back to my formative years as a craft beer drinker massaging both hops and malt into a perfectly balanced thoroughly assertive river of flavor. grapefruit pine caramel and biscuit are all present in equal measure with everything wrapping up in a solidly bitter resinous finish with just enough lingering caramel to keep things smooth. delicious.  f: on the full side of medium-bodied with ample velvety carbonation. sticky in a good way.  o: simply splendid and not just for nostalgia’s sake. the hop/malt/alcohol balance is dialed in just right with every component singing clearly and nothing dominating. great stuff. beers of fame tick 202/250. cheers!
1802,Eliot Ness,4.05,this one was a bit dated date said enjoy by two twenty five twenty three. its mid september so thats a couple months past date. very good have been in the mood for an amber. for some reason ambers have been appealing to me right now. glad to revisit this one from time to time its an excellent choice. the question is what category would you put this in a logger or an amber? cheers!
1803,Eliot Ness,3.85,this was a really good standard red/amber lager. i enjoy my craft beers and this one is acceptable as a store bought beer. i consider myself a novice but i have been to many breweries and tried various types. i do not have the patience for the budweiser-type watered down beers so there’s that for my quality preferences. this is an easy to drink smooth not bitter amber lager i’d gladly purchase again to have around the house. not the best i’ve ever tasted but definitely up there.
1804,Eliot Ness,5,one of my top 3 beers off all time. i love ambers and this one is absolutely fantastic. the caramel color and in my opinion hint of sweet is very good. not bitter at all. i try to be pretty real and to the point on reviews so trust me if you like ambers this is a must try. the eliot ness theme is pretty neat too.
1805,Eliot Ness,3,super super malty. pretty emblematic of the amber lager. pours a clear deep red with a small but long-lasting frothy rim. great for this style of beer just would have liked a little bit more hoppiness to stand up to the extreme amounts of malt flavor in this.
1806,Eliot Ness,4.25,pours a dark clear amber with a nice off-white fluffy head and good lacing. the aroma has notes of caramel maple and bread crust as well as some herbal and citrusy hops. the flavor is more pronounced and well rounded with a lush candied and toasted malt flavor balanced perfectly with some bitter herbal and spicy hops. the finish is drying and clean. overall a really exceptional amber lager. i personally find amber lagers to be a tad underwhelming most of the time preferring either very pale or very dark lagers instead. this beer however is one of the exceptions.
1807,Eliot Ness,3.94,updated review 2/2023:  appearance: pours a clear deep ruby to amber color with a mild off white head. srm of 17-19. (4.00)  aroma: moderate to mild aromas of breadk malt toast some honey. (3.75)  flavor: moderate flavors of rihc bread honey lightly toasted with some amber notes. a smooth sweet finish. (4.00)  feel: medium-bodied okay carbonation. drinks malty and sweet. (4.00)  compared to lakefront riverwest stein 2/2023: pours darker milder aromas. stronger flavors. more rich amber malt. more toasted. more bitter. less smooth honey and white bread.  compared to alaskan amber 3/2023: pours darker similar head. similar aromas. more bread malts and grains. less toasted amber and ruby malts. more toasted dry cleaner.  compared to bent paddle 14 amber/esb 3/2023: pours darker milder head. more toasted bread and caramel. less brown bread tea pine notes.  overall: not quite as i remember from my first review four years ago. cant believe havent had this one in four years. red toasty amber. a little hoppy and evolves a bit as it warms. toasty and somewhat crisp and dry. drinks well but i think i hyped this one up too much to be the #1 amber lager on beer advocate. however definitely evolves some nice hoppy and toasty notes as it warms. (rating: 3.94+)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- original review 5/2019:  appearance: pours a dark ruby red color with a mild-moderate heavy yellow head. aroma: mild citrus hop aromas with a bittersweet roasted barley aroma. flavor: strong cherry and toffee flavors. not roasty but dark fruit. definitely black cherry. molasses. subtle citrus flavors. less hops than a marzen. lighter bodied less sweet and caramel. this one is light and dry black cherry. some rye flavor. moderate bitterness on the back-end. feel: medium bodied. well carbonated. feels full and foamy on the palate. moderate bitterness. finishes incredibly balanced but dry for the amount of malt flavor.  overall: now this is a real vienna lager. its dark and ruby red. its dark cherry-syrup flavored but not roasty. definitely a malt forward beer that has an appropriate amount of hops to make this a dynamic product from great lakes.
1808,Eliot Ness,4.17,love this beer. eliot ness is what american amber lagers should all strive to be. wonderful maltiness with a firm bitterness to keep it nice and balanced. a solid offering from great lakes.
1809,Export Stout London 1890,4.34,had on tap. roasted black body large light brown head periodic lacing. roasted malt with earth dried dark fruit dark bittersweet chocolate and licorice in the smell. taste adds coffee grounds boozy hints and a herbal hop kiss on finish. this is really well done. the feel while balanced roasty malty and dry i just which it had a little more depth.
1810,Export Stout London 1890,4,330 ml bottle conditioned bought at the cheese & wine shop darlington. abv is 7.7%. pitch black colour big to moderate brown head. roasty aroma with strong notes of coffee hints of liquorice and ashes. the flavour is roasty and quite dry again strong notes of coffee hints of liquorice and dark bitter chocolate. good stuff.
1811,Export Stout London 1890,4.06,330ml bottle from house of trembling madness york (£2.99): opaque black with a 3cm bubbly head thats dark beige with a foamy surface thats quite thick & holds great too eventually settling as a creamy 1cm tall one. the nose is creamy with chocolate light roasted malts & a touch of alcohol then an earthy coffee & cocoa finish thats all balanced well. the chocolate sweetness & darker malts carry over to the taste with a roasted bitterness & subtle alcohol kick again too before the coffee bitterness rounds things off. its thick & smooth creamy at points with quite a bitter aftertaste & fine carbonation at points.
1812,Export Stout London 1890,4.21,the beer pours a creamy and hefy brown and yellow head that strongly resembles the foam you get from pouring coffee. the beer itself is a beautiful dark chocolate brown with a nice and creamy appearance to it.  the smell is good. it has a creamy and lightly roasted note upfront followed by some light coffee and bits of bittersweet chocolate to it.  the taste is very good. all the notes in the are still in the taste but come out and mix differently. the sweet cocoa comes out amid a bitter dark coffee with a light creamy note in the finish. the flavors work well with each other and their intensity is just perfect even this close to the best by date.  the feel is good. it has a medium heavy body and silky texture to it with a slightly acidic finish.  overall this is a delicious and well-crafted export stout worth getting. its flavors and smell are very nice and comforting on a cold day.
1813,Export Stout London 1890,3.98,note: the abv% appears variable by batch here 7.5% which differs from both the description^ and the photo^.  l- inky black held right by a haolgen not a photon gets through. pours with a 2mm deep tan really creamy smooth looking head. -- p.s. 15 mins later. head holds well esp. for a 7.5% and forms heavy deep-tan lacing all down the sides of the glass. s- big cocoa with some coffee not far behind in the blend. t- similar here to the smell big cocoa coffee hints - them wham into pungent charry/wood-smoke notes. the latter in the finish coincides with some notable hoppy bitterness arriving on the scene. f- its big in fact for a mere 7.5% the whole comes together as pretty massive on the palate. it seems to be a very well crafted beer. o- an accomplished beer well suited to slow-sipping in wintertime. a seriously big-hitter on taste/feel without straying ott or out of balance. fascinating to try and will appeal to fans of seriously full-on black beer. not cheap i suppose but from a small brewery by mail order and for a beer of this haut-refined brutality (;)) it would easily have cost much much more. bought from tremblingmadness/york/uk for home delivery to london as part of a diy chosen mixed-case of interesting brews. 330ml bottle bb: 20/08/2022 £2.99.
1814,Export Stout London 1890,4.41,this stout is true to its export style. roasted malt is front and center but it is not sweet. it is dry with a very balanced bitterness to it. the ending comes full circle back to its roasted malt roots.
1815,Export Stout London 1890,4.26,serving: bottle bottled: aug-2-2019 (consumed oct-27)   it pours thick and jet black with a big beautiful barely brown styrofoam head that leaves huge rings of lacing. lovely. the aroma is mainly milk chocolate and smooth coffee roast. the flavor follows right along with mocha espresso crema brown sugar barnwood. it is medium bodied and even the tiniest possible bit on the thin side when you consider the abv (shaved off a touch on the feel for this) soft medium carbonation lingering roasty finish that doesn\t get out of hand. this is a very nice very enjoyable beer that is pretty straightforward and together insofar as its components. a really nice big cocoa flavor dominates but balances the rest very drinkable. these guys really know their way around a stout it would seem based on the two i\ve tried from them.  4.75...4.25...4.25...4...4.25
1816,Export Stout London 1890,4.35,i am awed by this experience. to say this is an authentic export stout is to show my loss for words. it is superb. it doesnt try too hard it does nothing to excess and is a beautifully balanced piece of brewing. while looks are just better than average smells are a panoply of chocolate and well-roasted malt. tastes prove i am experiencing a master blender of roasted malts who makes hops almost unnecessary. and if there are no oats in the bill its silkiness and softness fooled me. my mouth gets the same from beginning to end... well-integrated brewing. bravo!  i bought this at the utobeer store in londons borough market. (i went there to find some belgian alternatives; getting tired of british micro-beers that taste too much like what i get in the states.) but i was glad to find the kernel and this export stout. they obviously work hard and smart at their craft and i am eager to find their belgian saisons. perhaps a visit to the bermondsey dive right near kernel is in order.
1817,Export Stout London 1890,4.25,the hoppy beers and the saison types in here were epic all time even dont get me wrong but it was the subtle nuances and complexities of all of the dark beers we had here that frankly turned me on the most. this is an absolutely brilliant example of an old world style about as traditional as they come fresh tasting which is an odd thing to grasp on to in a style like this but it hits me hard and its about as well made as it could possibly be which was a theme across almost everything we drank at kernel super impressive operation there. glorious coal black color tall khaki or sandstone head airy on top of dense a visual juxtaposition that is quite striking. its immediately a little less hoppy than some of the other dark ones they do more grain driven with deep roast light tannins crazy depth and layering and a well developed old world english yeast strain presence in the nose. notes of roasted chestnut charcoal and burnt bread crusts are there in the flavor with the smoothness and maturity of the yeast running through it. some bitterness from the roast a dark drip coffee element and an almost uplifting frothing oaty vibe although im unsure of the presence of oats in this especially for a historical recipe like we have here but it has that texture for sure. satin smooth and lingering on the palate at the end the yeast contributing more and more as it moves along. very dry with a slight astringency that raises intrigue and overall just impossibly satisfying and drinkable. a wonderful example of the style!
1818,Export Stout London 1890,4.33,pours a pitch black coloration with a large beige foamy/creamy head leaving a lot of lacing as it slowly fades. smells of roasted slightly caramelly malts and coffee with a hint of chocolate and licorice. taste is quite roasty and bitter with strong notes of roasted malt and coffee and lighter notes of cocoa leather tobacco and licorice and a certain light earthy/herbal hoppiness. finishes with a strong bitterness and some roasted coffee notes lingering in the aftertaste. smooth creamy mouthfeel with a medium body and low/medium carbonation.  this is great for its rich roasted bitter almost peaty coffee notes balanced by a very light chocolate/caramel sweetness and herbal/earthy accents. body may be a tad light but mouthfeel is excellent. fantastic stuff if you like your stouts on the roasted/bitter side.
1819,Export Stout London 1890,4.25,330 ml bottle beer merchants manchester - pours dark jet black with a medium tanned foamy head. nice lacing. medium carbonation. aroma - roasted malts coffee cacao molasses creamy milky notes. taste - slightly sweet roasted malts roasted coffee dark chocolate molasses medium dry bitter finish. lovely roasty slightly sweet stout. smooth as silk.
1820,Export Stout London 1890,3.99,bottle date: 7/3/18 palate contaminants: other beer  color is one step back from the darkest of dark browns. nice fine light brown head. some lacing.  chocolate and tobacco on the nose and its pretty rich. toast and black licorice behind those. a little powdered creamer too.  unfortunately the main taste is burnt toast right down to the bread being a grain product. moderate-heavy bitterness. theres some light sweetness toward the middle but its disconnected.  fine carbonation and a pleasant medium weight. the only knock is the bitter aftertaste.
1821,Kriek Ale,4.32,2021 version. has been refridgerated since new. 7.8%. just a totally beautiful beer from the deep garnet red colour to the amazing funky/sour nose to the lovely flavor profile. sour but so under control. great carbonation and great dying mouth feel. i think age has done this one wonders.
1822,Kriek Ale,4.3,2021
1823,Kriek Ale,4.59,divine
1824,Kriek Ale,3.9,april 2017: 750 ml corked & caged bottle as cascade kriek northwest sour ale ale aged in oak barrels with cherries 2015 project. abv is 7.1%. at cardinal pub & bar stavanger. brownish red colour moderate to small off-white head with a peachy hue. aroma of sour cherries lactic acid oak and farmhouse. medium sour flavour distinct notes of sour cherries lactic acid and oak.
1825,Kriek Ale,4.5,2013 drinking amazing
1826,Kriek Ale,4.14,a 750ml corked and caged bottle 2015 project. poured into a 3 fonteinen stemmed glass.  appearance: a lightly hazy deep amber red colour with a one finger beige head that dissipated quickly but settled to a thin layer while leaving some nice lacing.  aroma: tart cherries oak maybe some mixed berries.  taste: sour tart cherries oak and a hint of spices.  mouthfeel: medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  overall: nice cherry flavours slightly acidic but not overly so.
1827,Kriek Ale,4.28,2017 from the bottle...  a deep dried blood red with auburn and chestnut highlights bordering the clean body towards the browner side of the spectrum. it would be still looking if it werent for the few rising bubbles hopelessly devoted to supporting some kind of cap above but a failed attempt nonetheless.  sweet and sour cherries clearly and proudly display themselves front and center with a mouthwatering acidity. deep red wine oak barrel and all shine from withing. a touch of pepper and damp mulch linger in the end.  wow this thing tastes like straight sour grape and cherry fun dip. i think the puckering powdery tartness not only exemplifies the feel but must be considered a flavor to this beast as well. as it warms oak certainly comes through along with a boysenberry sweetness.  feel?... see above. add some strong tannins an initial slickness a wood stripping acidic drying tartnessand almost no carbonation and viola. there you have it.  this is a sour to compete with the most of sours. delicious well executed but so friggin intense like most of the offerings ive had the pleasure of enjoying. certainly not for the faint of heart.  cheers.
1828,Lush,4.35,very good dipa. quite smooth with a tropical aroma and taste but not bitter. has a sweet flavor but nothing overpowering. 8% alcohol but doesn’t have a strong alcohol taste. can creep up on you though so probably can’t have more than one. would definitely seek to have again.
1829,Lush,3.89,pours yellow or light amber with a rocky head that persists. aroma is mostly melon with undertones of peach. taste follows with the addition of a touch of grapefruit and a gentle bitterness along with hints of watermelon and white wine. feel is full without being overly creamy.  overall its not a standout for me but a good beer that manages to avoid all the neipa pitfalls that catch so many breweries.
1830,Lush,3.75,** 06/28/23  can to snifter  usa soccer vs. st. kitts & nevis gold cup.   look: creamy head good retention thick and pulpy creating a mild haze bright yellow color. aroma: melon peach taste: peach citrus pineapple white grape grass feel: light to medium body. ok carbonation. a little tacky.  good beer.  **
1831,Lush,5,it’s just my favorite dipa. what i call the standard to match. some come close like captain’s daughter from grey sail in ri but lush is more readily available so it’s my go to.
1832,Lush,4.53,poured into a brandy snifter in the pine room. lush is the perfect name for this delicious brew.  another amazing vermont ipa.  i hope i can get another sixtel.
1833,O.W.K.,4.65,b2. served at sp from bottle. waited for it to warm for awhile. pitch black. nice balance of bourbon and vanilla on the nose. complex beer. starts off with bourbon forward then vanilla comes in very subtlety and finishes with delicious chocolate. medium to heavy mouthfeel. would’ve liked it heavier some. vanilla is there but subtle showcasing the barrel. i would’ve liked more vanilla however.
1834,75 Minute IPA,4.3,poured this from a bottle. a: pours a hazy golden body with thick white head with nice retention and lacing s: sweet citrus smelling beer; slight alcohol notes t: earthy slightly citrus taste with subtle spicy aftertaste m: medium bodied and pretty smooth; nice drinking beer d: nice feel and taste combo; solid overall
1835,75 Minute IPA,4,reminded of this beer by the how many beers of fame have you reviewed? post. reviewed from memory have probably had about a six-pack in my life. this is fine but does not live up to the hype.
1836,75 Minute IPA,4.1,clear bright amber coloring beautiful bone white head lasting long looking lovely.  aroma: ah! citrus and pine aplenty. gorgeous. a little tropical fruit melon and pineapple in this nose. orange and lime too. ah i say again.  taste: boom! just what we want from an ipa but creamy and smooth and just delightful. bittersweet notes blast the palate followed by malty sweetness. none too caustic this ipa its smooth and palatable as can be.  i peeked at the label. maple syrup? not getting that yet. huh.  hop bitterness is restrained but enjoyable. delicious. tasty. i\m loving it. i\m liking this so much it\s time to find out more about it. okay so….a bottle conditioned india pale ale with maple syrup. 7.5% abv. there are some situations when 90 is too much. there are other situations when 60 is too little. there are many situations when 75 is just right. bottle-conditioned with pure maple syrup for complexity and dry-hopped out the bejeezum boards.
1837,75 Minute IPA,4.14,12oz bottle. unfortunately i did not check the bottling date which is 10/29/19 which makes the beer about eleven months in the bottle. i picked this up out of the stores cooler and didnt think i needed to date check. anyways . . . cloudy deep gold colored body. one finger of lingering white pillowy head. not much left on the glass for lacing. aroma is grassy and muddy hops with a sweet note from the maple syrup. solid malt background. taste is grassy and piney hops with a sweet note. approaching a bitter note but not quite. smooth trail off into the after taste. allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination. mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer with dense coating and filling of the mouth. very good carbonation. i will try to try this again with a younger bottling date but this is still a very good hoppy but sweet concoction.
1838,75 Minute IPA,3.91,i got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf at a beer store in lacrosse wi whilst there to move my daughter into school. the beer poured a clear golden with thin white head that is leaving a nice lace. the scent was mild hop notes. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with smooth citrus hop presence and a tangerine finish. the mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. overall it is a good beer.
1839,Imperial Stout,4.56,12 oz bottle bottled on date: 11/20/2016 consumed on: 20 nov 2022 glass: snifter abv: 10.5% serving temp: 49.3 f   look: jet black with a brown head that is very thin. the head quickly dissipates to a ring with some film over parts of the beer. what lacing exists is excellent.  smell: dark bittersweet chocolate and coffee. char. molasses. anise. caramelized and somewhat burnt sugar. a fair amount of earth.  taste: an earthy and bitter hit up front but nothing overwhelming. this becomes char dark chocolate and some coffee. molasses and anise follow. the earthy notes return towards the end. the sip finishes bittersweet and this lingers into and through the aftertaste which is very much unsweetened chocolate.  feel: silky and mouth-coating. a nice warmth from the alcohol. the body is only a shade or 2 lighter than full.  overall: an excellent (russian) imperial stout. one of my favorites of the style. i buy it when i see it. which last was in 2019.  i purchased this beer fresh back in december 2016. it has been in my cellar ever since. it has handled its age (6 years) quite well i would say.
1840,Imperial Stout,4.33,2015 bottle poured into a founders brewing co snifter  a: pours basically black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing.  s: roasty earthy a little char dark chocolate coffee molasses burnt sugar slight umami notes and faint hints of dark fruit.  t: roasted malt dark chocolate black coffee a little char earthy molasses a touch of toffee and faint dark fruit on the finish.  m: full body mild carbonation creamy smooth.  o: somehow i think this one went straight from the store to my cellar and has been there ever since so its about time i crack into it! total time capsule back to before every imperial stout was loaded up with adjuncts and its aged beautifully. another example of why founders is quite possibly the best at brewing dark beers.
1841,Imperial Stout,4.69,12 oz bottle born on 11/5/19 poured into a snifter at 55 degrees f: l - dark mahogany with a hazelnut head that lingered around the edges s - roasted malt molasses bitter chocolate coffee t - follows the nose very well f - thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation o - this beer lives up to the founders standard; it is supposed to age well and just under 2.5 years in it is still sensational
1842,Imperial Stout,4.43,single 12 ounce bottle from founders in grand rapids nov 2019 when travel was still a thing. pours pitch black with finger of creamy mildly reddish brown head. aroma of dark fruits caramel mildly roasty with notes of chocolate and just a hint of coffee. taste is rich with plummy note chocolate; a brief wave of smoke drifts across the palate caramel malt and a touch of espresso bitterness balancing the sweetness. rich and smooth full creamy mouthfeel with a hint of boozy heat - wonderfully bittersweet. wish more had followed me home.
1843,Imperial Stout,4.23,look: poured from 12 oz bottle into a snifter. midnight black with a creamy burnt amber head. wonderful looking beer.  smell: roasted coffee beans malts caramel dark chocolate.  taste: chocolate cacao malts coffee. also getting some dried fruits - possibly cranberry or cherry.  feel: creamy thick mouthfeel this thing just rips as it goes down. has a dark feel to it (literally and figuratively) great for sipping with a book. gets better as it warms.  overall: one of the best russian imperial stouts you can find pretty widely available highly recommend. if dark evil beers are your thing pick this up.
1844,Imperial Stout,4.24,12oz bottle. this thing has been aged in the mini-fridge for 5+ years and now is the time to crack this sucker  it still has a decent amount of carbonation and a nice little ring of foam. it was meant to age this is telling me. smells like coffee alcohol chocolate and hops. prominent alcohol flavor even at chilled temps and with the age on it. this was a bad boy back in the day i bet. tons of cocoa powder and a honey malt backing that compliments and stands up to the choco malt and alcohol flavors that come close to dominating
1845,Imperial Stout,4.4,355 ml bottle from the norwegian importer. abv is 10.5% 90 ibu. pitch black colour impressive brown head. roasty aroma roast malts strong coffee dark chocolate liquorice tar wood and a hint of smoke. rich mouthfeel. medium sweet and rich flavour roast malts liquorice and strong coffee galore bitter hops in the finish. high wow! factor.
1846,Double Stack,4.21,l: pours a thick oily black with a small tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves no laci g on the glass.  s: cinnamon pancakes drenched in maple syrup with a side of coffee.  t: sweet syrup mixes with chocolate and a slightly bitter coffee. aroma is a little better than taste.   f: smooth cola like body.  o: this definitely hits the pancakes and syrup taste.
1847,Double Stack,4.29,4.29/5: the aroma and flavor both have a fantastic maple presence yet the coffee and roasted malts do just enough to keep the sweetness in check
1848,Double Stack,4.5,everything about this beer is great pours dark with big head(pour slowly) great maplely - malty smell. flavvor is outsstanding great malt maple taste - not strong slightly sweet
1849,Double Stack,4.25,a - pours pitch black with a thin tan head. light soapy lacing.  s - aroma is black coffee roasted malts and maple.  t - the taste is black coffee vanilla maple dark chocolate and bitter roasted malts.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. soft crisp mouthfeel with a sticky dry finish.  o - really solid. less sweet than expected.
1850,Double Stack,4.4,a tavour treat. pours a dark brown color with a minimal head that disappears quickly. aroma is maple syrup and roasted malts. taste is sweet coffee maple vanilla and cinnamon. smooth and creamy.
1851,Double Stack,4.27,look - black with a great than head and great sticky lacing and rimming smell & taste - maple forward followed by chocolate and coffee with a rosted malt as well. feel - full body creamy lighter carb overall - really taste like liquid panackes with maple syrup and some coffee
1852,Double Stack,3.94,double stack from great notion. 16 fl oz can from @snaotheus in nbw bif 17. reviewed 14/05/23 (review 3101). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. top rim of can stamped “sticky stacks 03.06.23”. stored at 34 degrees at home. served at 46.2 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 54.5 degrees f. appearance – 4.25 first pour – amber brown (srm 18) clear. body – black (srm 40) opaque. under direct light same. when rear lite opaque with light penetration at the edges – ruby. head: average (maximum 1.1 cm aggressive center pour) tan high density quickly diminishing reducing to a 0.2 cm crown constantly renewed by carbonation and a thin partial cap. lacing – poor. thin line of near-microscopic bubbles. aroma – 4.5 – when the tab is popped instant aroma of coffee and maple syrup! weak roasted malt no hops no yeast. no ethanol (11 % abv as marked on the label). flavor – 3.5 – moderately bitter coffee with maple syrup flavor as backing. bitterness enhanced by the char flavor. no malt no yeast no hops. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. slight gastric warming. palate – 4 – medium; watery short of syrupy/creamy; soft carbonation. final impression and summation: 4 without the char bitterness i would have rated the flavor 4.5; for my taste buds the char nearly ruined the maple/coffee combo. otherwise this is a very good coffee stout. and that “natural flavor and caramel color” screams “unnecessary crap added”.
1853,Double Stack,4.4,canned 3/6/23. sticky stacks stamped on the side of the can  its finally time to try this classic from great notion thanks to tavour. its their most reviewed beer on ba and their only one to have entered the top 250. this should be their magnum opus. will it be? lets crack it open and find out  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  this is absolutely a maple bomb in the nose but the coffee plays a nice supporting role as well. im picking up on aromas of maple syrup milk chocolate burnt caramel medium roast coffee vanilla brown sugar and straight up pancakes  its surprisingly much more bitter in taste compared to the nose not to say that its super bitter but it has a nice bite. on the front end of the sip im tasting raw maple dark roast coffee charred malt vanilla cocoa powder molasses light raisin and brown sugar. the swallow brings notes of maple syrup dark roast coffee cacao nibs burnt caramel charred malt dark toast and light molasses  a medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a sweet beer with a bite. finishes a tad sticky but nothing that hurts the drinkability  its not reinventing the wheel of maple adjuncted stouts but its damn good nonetheless
1854,Double Stack,4.7,very dark brown color. aroma is very maple forward with a lot of vanilla pastry and coffee notes. flavor is amazing so sweet and so much going on— again with the coffee vanilla and maple… also toffee and caramel notes. low bitterness. very full body with some astringency. holy crap would get again it’s so good! taking lactase enzyme preemptively with this one because i am concerned.
1855,Double Stack,4.77,on tap at the brass tap cedar falls ia. served in a 5-ounce snifter. pitch black in color with a thin tan head. absolutely huge aromas and flavors of maple syrup dark roast coffee pancakes and char. lots of roasty malt bitterness without much attendant sweetness. slightly boozy with a syrupy mouthfeel. notes of bitterness and char linger on the palate long after the finish. overall well crafted and highly recommended.
1856,Double Stack,4.71,aroma gives off a strong alluring waft of maple and chocolatey malt. taking a drink feels like getting a huge bite out of a big fluffy delicious belgian waffle coated in maple syrup followed by a roasty bite of coffee. nothing ive ever had comes so close to the maple taste every sip is a breakfast meal in one. top tier!
1857,Double Stack,4.19,can poured into a mountain rambler brewery snifter  a: pours basically black with a frothy tan brown head that settles to a thin layer and leaves some thin lacing.  s: opening the can is like opening the door to a sugar shack as youre met with a wave of maple followed by bold coffee roasty malt a little char and faint smoke light earthy notes chocolate vanilla toffee and slightly toasty biscuity bready pancake-y-ness.  t: opens with a huge hit of maple syrup followed by milk chocolate vanilla and a nice touch of coffee that leads into roasty malt a little char and a touch of smoke with underlying mild earthy and slightly nutty notes toffee and toasty biscuity/bready malt very reminiscent indeed of a stack of pancakes.  m: full body somewhat mild carbonation pretty smooth though somehow i would describe it as especially creamy alcohol is rather well hidden giving just the slightest touch of warmth as it comes up to room temp.  o: ive had a couple cans of this sitting in the fridge for a few years now just waiting for the right night to crack into my special liquid souvenirs from a great road trip. but as time passed and that night never came i got on the lookout for a fresh can to purposely do the opposite with; to push to the front of the line as quickly as possible and try fresh. a lucky shipment of cans hit my area recently so here we are cracking into a can thats a little more than a month old.  this beer probably has the strongest maple presence of any beer i\ve ever had including cbs. to their credit you definitely get the sensation of taking a big bite of pancakes dripping with syrup after just taking a sip of your morning mocha. unfortunately that kinda leads into its downfall. while it is true to their own description of having an extreme maple syrup flavor it can come off as ungodly sweet up front. not gonna lie i\m also a little weary of the label saying coffee maple syrup natural flavor and caramel color potentially meaning there\s some kinda maple or \pancake extract\ in there. this one is fun to try but could really benefit from some balance; upping the coffee backing the maple down a notch maybe even both would help make it less of a novelty and more of an enjoyable sipper you go back to. maybe some age will do the trick. i\ll definitely update when that right night comes along and i get into my vintage cans. for now i\d say it\s a cool one to try as a short pour but it can get overwhelming in greater volumes.
1858,Pliny The Elder,4.68,l - light yellow golden with a ton of clarity a white head that dissipates quickly leaving behind a thin cap and a good amount of lacing s - bright floral piney hops along with notes of citrus zest t - follows the nose: bright fresh floral pine slightly bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with notes of citrus - candied grapefruit orange zest - cracker malt a little bit of honey grass notes f - light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation - bright fresh crispy - very clean o - one of the benchmarks for the west coast ipa style. incredibly well balanced and easy to drink. glad to have finally gotten my hands on it
1859,Pliny The Elder,4.23,solid.
1860,Pliny The Elder,4.25,served in an imperial nonic pint glass  this beer pours a golden hue and is topped with a couple inches of off-white head that leaves nice lacing.  it has a real nice fruity citrus aroma. i get a little pine.  nice balance of citrus and pine flavors. a little bit of lingering resin in the finish  very good iipa. its one of the pioneers. as with all trailblazers newer and better beers come along. i live in ohio and am very happy that i can drink hop juju. someday it too will be a trailblazer in the rear-view mirror of my lifelong beer trek.
1861,Pliny The Elder,5,pliny is really difficult to find in southern cal but i finally tried one for the first time at the russian river brew pub in santa rosa. it was on tap so super fresh. i think it is probably the most well balanced dipa i ever tried. i now understand the hype!
1862,Pliny The Elder,4.62,an excellent brew. without taking anything away from pliny i prefer heady topper & sip of sunshine.
1863,Pliny The Elder,4.44,my first pliny. 2 week old bottle so quite fresh. extremely well dialed in almost leaves a piney resin on your lips and tongue.
1864,Natural Light,4,i dont get the hate. not gonna go into detail and give it an in-depth review. heres my common cheap light lager ranking instead: busch light
1865,Natural Light,2.17,this beer is easily the most tasteless beer i\ve ever tried. i\ve had other beers with less abv that had more flavor. seems kind of silly to opt for this weak offering when there are many other better light beer choices that cost about the same.
1866,Natural Light,2.92,a perennial classic natural light evokes feelings of belonging and good times. it is the habit of the fool to judge a book by its prose grammatical correctness or coherent story. the learned man forms his judgement of its value based on how it makes them feel deep inside. a book that makes me feel good i could read 15-20 times in one day. i can delete 15-20 nattys (colloquial term) in a day; it makes me feel good.
1867,Natural Light,2.1,from a 12oz can:  appearance: clear pale yellow ok head at first fades out quickly.  smell: vague hay/grass first then vague sweet fruitiness?  taste: remains vague following the smell kind of light cracker taste i suppose. very light bodied its light beer!  overall: had to pick up a 12 of the retro label to review. natty light is infamous where i went to college (iowa state) due to the basketball coach (larry eustachy) being pictured among co-eds from the u of missouri drinking said beverage. natty is slightly better than bud light but has very little flavor so ill continue to pick up miller lite or coors light when i want a light beer.
1868,Natural Light,1.7,awful
1869,Natural Light,2.58,not sure what to say about this beer it basically has no aroma little color no decent beer flavor to speak of so i guess the carbonation and mouthfeel is akin to beer but aside from that theres nothing else to report. it doesnt get any lighter than natural light. its definitely crisp and refreshing so if you enjoy beer flavored carbonated water then this is your beer.
1870,Natural Light,2.5,absurdly drinkable crisp clean cold and refreshing. natural light is a good lager with a touch of bitterness and sweetness. it remains flavorful despite the fact that it is a light beer. 50/100
1871,Kirin Lager,2.19,may 2002: the bad thing about living in norway is the price of beer. the good thing however is that those of us who live near the coast and have a small boat (yes like me) can catch our own seafood - for free. todays freshly caught crab was my chosen accompaniment with kirin lager - a good choice i believed as the japanese love seafood more than anyone else in the world. im sorry to say that most european pilseners / light lagers would have been a better choice than this one. there is very little aroma the beer is dry (which is a good thing when you have it with seafood) but some more flavour would have been good too! - aftertaste is metallic. surely the japanese can do better than this??
1872,Kirin Lager,3,t19
1873,Kirin Lager,3,had a few of these with dinner at a japanese restaurant several years ago. i dont remember anything special either good or bad about it. it went well with the food and tasted ok. hence the average rating of 3.
1874,Leaner,4.52,look - hazy orangish copper with a really nice white head and rimming and slight lacing smell -easy peach tart taste -really nice slightly tart peach and wood feel -medium body and creamy overall - love it
1875,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,3.34,500ml can from brewers haven. dark amber pour with abundant off-white fluffy head. malty aroma brown bread. taste is malty with mild sweetness. some vegetal notes towards the finish but does not distract from the beer.
1876,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,3.83,appearance is a darkcloudy dark amber. close to medium carbonation with a medium body all adding up to a nice feel. aroma is maltdark bread grain and buckwheat honey. taste is maltybreadgraindark honeywith a little bread. overall this is an excellent beer
1877,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,4.06,pours a deep amber color with a generous head of beige foam.  aroma has a combination of malt fruit and toast.  taste has a delicious fruit toffee and malt flavor. smooth.  a unique and delicious medium bodied dark lager.  bom 7/2023
1878,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,4.13,pours a dark hazy brown color with a generous head and lacing aroma has dark fruit toffee and malt hints taste has a pleasant dark fruit toffee and malt flavor a medium bodied well carbonated beer a good dark lager
1879,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,4.17,can: this isn’t the prettiest body to look at with a muddied red ale look to it though it has a decent and sustained head to make up for it. based on what i read and my experience this version of the style seems a little bit in between the maltiness of a marzen and a mildly hoppy red ale.  the toasted malts drive the flavor and a tea-like to earthy to dark nut bitterness evolves to keep the malts from expanding on the sweetness they provide. the nose is of a medium grain bread which comes through in the taste. at times the flavor reminds me of a breakfast bread that someone left the sugar out of or at least mis-measured it on the low side.  other more minor notes include a little malt tang and some medium strength iced tea. in fact that tea sensation feds into a dark nutty bitterness the one that continues to balance the malt sweetness even as it strengthens a little bit as the beer warms. this warmth also brings a bit of a little bit of molasses to the aroma and taste which i didnt notice when it was colder. overall a malty beer that doesnt run sweet with a bitterness that compliments the malt quite well in my opinion.
1880,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,4.25,a: pours a near opaque reddish/orange color. a towering beige head forms with excellent retention and lace all the way down the glass. s: a big malty presence. toasted biscuit toffee dark fruits. the malt character is incredibly inviting and like some of their other beers reminds me of walking into a bakery. t: again all the malt character you could want. dark toasted and baked bread. toffee/caramelized malts and dark fruits. certainly sweet and a rich malt profile. though far from cloying or unbalanced in anyway. i just love the malt character here. m/o: a full body with crisp carbonation. that also becomes ultra smooth and silky. this feels like it should have more abv. though because it is not high in that regard this is incredibly moreish to drink.  i love the rich malty character here. in that regard it is almost in the doppelbock range but with a much lower abv than is typical for that style. which makes this all the more easy and inviting to come back to. all around well done.
1881,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,4.25,a beautiful opaque and hazy amber pour with a big fluffy foam cover. smells of sweet biscuits and bread. taste of caramel malt with biscuit undertones. sweet and velvety. very drinkable with a rich and silky mouthfeel. very interesting and unique example of this old traditional franconian style.
1882,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,4.29,half liter vom fass at hexenhäusle in nürnberg. paired beautifully with the local sausages and kartoffelsalat that i ordered. on the lighter side but a gorgeous beer. balanced sweetness throughout with a proper finish and feel. so easy to drink. so delicious. an all night kind of beer.
1883,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,4.29,16.9 oz can canned april 27 2023 into a tall lager glass. l: pours red & murky burnished copper with plenty of fine steady carbo bubbles a thin creamy light tan head that recedes to a thick skin with dollops of foam very good lacing. s: rich caramelized malts raisins plum dates dark fruits brown bread. quite malty. t: heavy caramelized malts figs brown bread crust dark fruits tannins light citrus zest which dries the finish quite a bit. has a light aged wooden halo about it and a light linger. there is a touch of acidity and only a slight aftertaste. moderately rich and lightly sweet. f: brisk firm lightly creamy medium-bodied feel with a smooth middle and a medium-length finish that is quite drying on the tongue. o: wow! aroma and taste are quite similar here. extremely pleasantly balanced fruit tastes along with succulent malts makes for a lovely drinking vienna lager that is imho world-class. i will get this again as it must be paired with meats & cheeses.
1884,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,3.84,from the big can it pours a very slightly reddish amber color with a very nice thick light tan/off-white head that slowly reduce and leaves lacing. the nose gets as someone described it a bit of astringency with notes of caramel and malt. the mouth gets a nice maltiness with notes of caramel roasted malts and some brown bread. nice rendition of the newly rediscovered style!
1885,Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,4,got one at bratwurst röslein. actually a very good beer strong malt back with light hoppiness.
1886,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.21,big wiff of coffee here like a very dark and robust roast. heavily roasted malts here. more roasted dark oats than oatmeal with some black chocolate and smoked ancho chili pepper in the mix. thick yet carbonated. very robust stout whose adjuncts are just as strong and bold as the stout character itself. pretty good.
1887,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.59,on tap pies and pints morgantown wv.  smoke coffee and vegetal aromas. so rich and complex in around and then....  a punch in the face of flavors and smokiness!. did i mention coffee? almost syrupy in the mouth booze forward. sweet maple and pecan come through as well!
1888,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.65,this is a very sneaky 9.4%. its such a smooth blend of coffee and chocolate notes. really enjoyed and would love to find it again. had it in winter and cant think of a better time to be drinking such a great beer
1889,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.37,dark black stout with moderate head. aroma is coffee and chocolate with a hint of alcohol. mouthfeel is medium bodied but smooth. taste is traditional stout with good notes of chocolate and coffee. a nice smooth finish. overall a very good beer.
1890,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.18,picked up a sixer from tw-greenville sc on 11-16-22 for $11.49. no canning date; consumed can #4 1-23-22.  beer pour dark brown with a beautiful nitro like mocha head that has some nice hang time.  nose has hints of coffee and mildly roasted malts.  taste is a mildly roasted malt base with the coffee adjunct blended it subtlety. finishes with a touch of cream and is well balanced with no sign of coffee astringency.  mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth.  overall a really nice job of incorporating the coffee adjunct. can see my self picking this up a few times a year!
1891,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,3.97,wondereful creamy stout light taste of coffee great beer to enjoy
1892,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,5,been my favorite non barrel aged coffee beer for a couple years. 10/10 would recommend. massive terps
1893,Maharaja,4.51,purchased as single at pilgrims market in cda id - canned may 10/23. 10.0% abv. pours a chill hazed golden apricot bronze with two fingers of creamy off white/tawny tinged head. nose is a burst of hops - citrus/orange piney resin some tropical fruit and even a bit of peach. there is a tiny bit of a soapy floral aroma and notes of caramel malt. taste is initially sweet citrus mango again some peach with caramel malt. resinous pine a herbal dank and sticky bitterness slowly builds. there is almost a touch of vanilla orange creamsicle sweetness. full and sticky bittersweet mouthfeel with a pleasant alcoholic warmth.
1894,Maharaja,4.09,excellent imperial. very heavily hopped. crisp and drinkable despite the higher abv. the hops bites like a snake as you sip it but it quickly fades away and is replaced by a mild sweetness. theres nothing overly complex going on here. no exotic notes to speak of. its a fairly basic imperial ipa in composition but man is it done well. will be buying this again and would probably put it in my top 5 list for imperials.  a borderline world-class imperial ipa in my opinion. its good. give it a try. im always impressed with avery beers whether it be an ipa a stout or whatever else.
1895,Maharaja,4.27,l- beautiful golden orange that you can barely see through. billowy white head that is slowly dissipating. i wouldnt say turbid but lots of small floaties  s- piney and rosin. with some citrus zest  t- sweet with a boozy bite. slight bitterness that lingers on the tongue. orange citrus notes.  f- slick with a little chewiness. lightly carbonated but still bright.  o- very enjoyable for a 10% ipa. i wasnt expecting it drinking this clean.
1896,Maharaja,4.36,1/27/2023 brew date. very drinkable double ipa. many dipas at 9% or above start to taste funny like too much sugar residue or just bland or unbalanced in some way. this one tastes very solid. a bit piney hoppy bitter like an ipa should taste. i say this is well done and ive had most dipas out there. worth the $3 a can at 10% abv.
1897,Maharaja,4.39,from a can produced 1/27/23. amber color with an inch of foamy tan colored head. piney hop smell. full bodied. big caramel malt flavor followed by dank piney hops. this thing packs a punch!
1898,Maharaja,3.71,12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.50. canned on 10/4/2022 which makes this one day shy of three months old.  look: pours a very nice copper color with a slight haze and a fluffy/rocky beige-colored head.  smell: strong hoppy aromas of citrus (grapefruit) pine and dank notes. not much else to say. it smells like it will be a bit boozy and there are a lot of spicy hop characteristics coming through. overall the aromas are a bit muted.  taste: my first impression is that this beer does taste very boozy. up front there is a nice caramel malt backbone which pretty quickly is overtaken by a plethora of spicy and dank hops. the finish is very bitter with tons of pine resin and some grapefruit rind and pith. it finishes on the dry side and it leaves a warming sensation in the chest.  feel: it has a slick oily kind of mouthfeel that is also a bit chewy. carbonated appropriately. its also boozy.  overall: this is very much a west coast style imperial ipa. it uses predominantly old school hop varieties and its expression is very much old school. i probably had this beer many years ago and i doubt that i was able to appreciate it then. honestly for me its enjoyable yet i find it to be a bit boring. its not my favorite style of beer but i can definitely appreciate it for what it is. its well-made and given that it is three months old it doesnt seem like it has suffered much due to age.  from the can/website: the maharaja flaunts his authority over a deranged amount of hops: tangy vibrant and intense along with an insane amount of malted barley – fashioning a dark amber hue and exquisite malt essence. maharaja is derived from the sanskrit words mahat meaning “great” and rajan meaning “king”. much like its namesake this imperial ipa is regal mighty and dank. with citrusy hops and caramel toffee malts as his servants he rules both with a heavy hand. dont be fooled by unassuming drinkability this beer is potent. welcome to his kingdom!  regal | mighty | dank  brewed with rocky mountain water malted barley (c-120 aromatic 2-row) hop varieties (columbus chinook centennial simcoe) dry-hop varieties (idaho 7 vic secret simcoe) & yeast (house ale strain)
1899,Maharaja,4.22,i used to drink this one back in 2014/15 in bombers when i could get it. i recently picked up some cans and although i enjoyed it did not have the same reaction to what i remembered in the past. the nose on it is what really convinced me something was different. i used to be blown away by just how big and fruity the smell on it was but the cans were muted in comparison. still a great beer.
1900,Maharaja,4.1,this is some good stuff - even though i broke one of my rules & picked this one up less than fresh. package 1/27/22 consumed 7/1/22 - happy 4th. still good - my rating reflects past fresher versions. l: from the can - stylish. s: sweet pine t: lots of hoppy notes crashing through. piney bitterness. boozy f: rich and smooth o: its a winner - belongs in your rotation if you like this style.
1901,Maharaja,4.1,pours a rich dark gold with ample head. smells fruity herbal and hoppy. the taste is grapefruit orange lemon piney and pretty bitter on the back end but it’s a mostly good finish. this is a dry hoppy strong dipa that is more than serviceable for the price cheers!
1902,Maharaja,4.89,this is an amazing beer. i have no idea why the named it after the official beer from india. the indian made beer is like a nice coors lite. this is a mans beer. fruity mango. nice balance between 10% and sweet n bitter. love it. get it if you can
1903,Maharaja,3.66,ok this one is pretty. its a orangeish copper barely translucent with a white head that settles into a nice cap and leaves lacing all over the walls of the glass. it smells very sweet with caramel bites and a touch of piney mangoes but its not as fragrant as expected. the alcohol is present on this one. the gates is sweet and warming up front followed by a nice tropical fruit flavor that compliments the alcoholic sweetness nicely. this one goes down too smoothly for a double digit abv beer. i could drink 2 of these in a row without feeling like ive over done it which is rare with me and dipas. if you see it on draft get yourself a pull but i dont see myself buying a four pack of this.
1904,Pink Killer,2.15,april 2017: 250 ml bottle from vinmonopolet nettbutikken. abv is 5%. hazy pale pink colour small white head. aroma of pink grapefruit juice and artificial candy some herbal notes too. pretty awful flavour medium sweet (but not as sweet as i feared) notes of artificial candy a slight grapefruit bitterness in the finish. will not buy again.
1905,Pink Killer,2.67,bought after being very attracted by the camp labelling. the beer pours a pinky orange colour as youd expect from a beer based on pink grapefruit and has a small fizzy white pink head. smell of grapefruit citrus quite inviting. taste is a massive let down very sugary and artificial tasting. i doubt any actual fruit every became involved with this beer. the finish is horribly cloying and sticks to the back of the throat with the fizziness accentuating this unpleasantness. this beer is like a attractive woman that leads you on only to spurn you and accuse you of getting the wrong idea.
1906,Pink Killer,1.74,de decervecitas. en copa grimbergen. en almuerzo con al albóndigas + chocos fritos. subidón de azúcar. no es que este tan mala pero esto debe ser hasta malo para la salud
1907,Pink Killer,2.25,de color rosado con una muy pequeña cabeza espumosa de poca retención. cuerpo y carbonatación media. aroma maltoso y afrutado. en boca es dulce pero no al punto de ser empalagoso.
1908,Pink Killer,2.51,weird! pours a pinkish-orange with lots of carbonation but no head. smells kind of grapefruit and kind of peachy. taste is very artificial of grapefruit peach cherry and slightly pepto-bismol. medicinal aftertaste. thin body high carbonation and huge sweetness makes this drink like a cola. i could see people liking this but the number has to be very limited.
1909,Pink Killer,2.76,poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass. looks like pink lemonade. tastes like sugar water. the best part is the pink & white bottle cap with a dog none on it.
1910,Bigfoot,4.15,barleywine-style. not a barleywine. this 2023 brew came up with a two-finger beige head when poured into a snifter. malty nose. the flavor is intriguing. roast pine piney hops. caramel. the finish needs smoothed out with aging. a little bitter which is ok and malt on the back end. the label reads ... or cellar ...  but i won\t.
1911,Bigfoot,3.97,l: deep red color. beige head forms at the pour. thin half inch head dissipates slowly. active carbonation maintains throughout the pint. s: malt caramel t: malt warm smooth alcohol caramel again f: fizzy and warmth. piney feel works up through the nose. o: very nice beer. will drink a couple and put a few away for later.
1912,Bigfoot,3.91,a 2023 iteration bottled on january 12 2023 and poured into a tulip about five months later.  pours dark/amber brown. excellent head. initially it releases big bubbles from the bottom of the pour that slowly bubble up. good retention and lacing.  aromas of dark fruit and piney hops along with some modest citrus.  the brew delivers initial sticky-bready caramel-malt sweetness balanced almost immediately by white pepper and pine hoppiness. as the brew warms a distinct grapefruit citrus note rounds out the middle along with raisin peach and molasses. some anise tobacco and leather are trying to manifest but need some time to mature. not as boozy as feared. there are quite a few different things going on here.  full bodied for sure it nevertheless is very drying and tingly which makes each sip welcome.  overall i understand why this brew can be polarizing because there is nothing subtle or nuanced about a newer bottle of this brew. regardless this is a very flavorful american barleywine that is excellent but would probably be better with a little more age to smooth things out from what is currently pretty wild.
1913,Bigfoot,4.15,this one appeared in our local grocery rural montana grocery store and and i thought it worth a try. up front i\ll admit that the word barleywine grabbed my eye and i missed the word style. while after buying the first sixpack for (at our store) a very reasonable price of $11.50 i then came back for the other four i liked it very much for what it was not what it purported to be. if you are looking for a barleywine this isn\t it. if instead you are looking for an very excellent dark imperial ipa this is the one! hops to spare and definitely a worthwhile pint to keep in your stock. if this sounds like it works for you then by all means grab some. i am glad i found it.
1914,Bigfoot,4.1,12 ounce bottle fridge chilled. dark amber khaki foam. aroma is a bit all over and it takes a moment to call out the pine and malt and woods. taste is malty and hops balanced at first drink then comes apart on the palate. caramel pine white pepper. solid bitterness. alcohol is present as it should be for the american barleywine style. feel is mid-weight mid-carb. overall good sud a little busy but not in a bad way. better as it warms.
1915,Bigfoot,4.07,big flavors thick grainy consistency. dry and bitter malt heavy first impression then the hops kick in with a piny and powdery finish. some bitter gentian root flavors (cocktail bitters) a little too much sometimes. raisins. herbal. mild sweetness is beaten back by the massive malt and hops. very similar to a double or triple ipa. if you like big and bitter this is it.
1916,Bigfoot,4.81,look - deep amber aggressive pour for a 2 tan head little lacing left after this session smell - woody malty piney floral spicy taste - toasted malt sweet caramel hoppy black pepper piney citrus feel - medium body and carbonation sticky piney resinous finish peppery overall - my first barleywine and im very impressed. there is some serious hop nectar going on here. flavor is very rich almost like youre drinking the hops extract concentrate straight from the can and the enormous malt body brings the balance of toasted malt and a bit of sweet caramel. this brew is right up my alley with intense hoppy piney bitter traits that linger after every sip. originally i bought one to try and that turned into buying a couple of six packs after i did try it. im gonna save a few to age and drink them in the years to come. bigfoot is definitely a beast so take your time and pair it with the long classic do you feel like we do from the frampton comes alive! album. enjoy!
1917,Bigfoot,4.29,2023 vintage:  poured from a 12 ounce bottle dated 1/19/23 into a snifter.  look- amber brown light brown frothy head no visible particulate average lacing above average head retention.  smell- bready earthy pine boozy barley medium strength of scent.  taste- bready toasted barley pine citrus black pepper boozy high strength of flavor.  feel- full body average carbonation highly mouth warming highly bitter mildly mouth coating moderately creamy.  overall- amber brown in color with no visible particulate and above average head retention. bouquet was malt forward with medium strength and notes of pine and booze. taste was high in strength and malt forward with pine citrus and black pepper character. feel was full bodied with plenty of mouth warming and bitterness. overall this provided a nice drinking experience and was a very enjoyable example of the style.
1918,Bigfoot,4.06,yes…! a very interesting barleywine beer….
1919,Bigfoot,3.6,it has that distinct sierra nevada skunkiness. a little more dark amber than their infamous ipas. currently cellaring mine to see what the age brings
1920,Bigfoot,3.71,2015 and stored with zero skill will it survive? l: dark brown with respectable tan foam. s: light sour notes dominate soy sauce on the end. t: brown bread crust hint of anise treacle cigar leaves. no burn left. f: a little slippery but still good to go. o: i think i caught this at the top of its age though possibly a year late. bigfoot approaching abbey ale territory.
1921,Bigfoot,4.27,poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass. i’m drinking the 2023 version. l - pours a dark amber color with a slight khaki head that dissipates quickly. s - smells of malt and booze. t - tastes of raisins molasses malty hoppy and boozy. definitely a lot going on. f - medium to full bodied with carbonation on the lighter side. o - very interesting barleywine.
1922,Bigfoot,4.08,strong and complex balancing sweet malt opening with hop bitterness on the back end. dark amber coppery reddish color with a nice khaki tan head that persists and sticks to the glass. the aroma is balanced along with the taste—combination of bready sweet and bitter notes and a bite from the alcohol.
1923,Bigfoot,4.3,2023 sierra nevada bigfoot barleywine - nice tan head  amber bodygreat bready sweet aroma + sweet carmel with a bitter finish taste 9.6% hidden well going to start pulling my older vintages to compare
1924,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.55,12 ounce can into a snifter. canned 4/4/23 had 8/27/23. also had on tap at april release.  pours a ruby brown color semi opaque with a half inch foamy head and light foamy lacing. aromas of bourbon caramel figs rye malt dates some vanilla and oak. smells slightly smoky. flavors of bourbon figs rye caramel malt dates leather vanilla some oak and brown sugar. smooth semi dry a very good medium body well carbonated.  excellent. has a big barrel presence overall and the spicy and bold rye barrels add a lot of character. has an array of distinct and expressive aromas and flavors. this is a top level deep wood entry- which says a lot.
1925,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.43,a quite dark brown body feigns black from its opacity but reveals a thin layer of almost clear red at the bottom. a fine tan head is barely able to develop before instantaneously disappearing to a fluid surface.  revolutions trademarks are tattooed all over this while adding a heavy dose of spiced dark fruits throughout its moderately viscous yet still zippy body. the darkest caramels and smoothest vanillin threads become all the more delectable after having your face in a charcoal fire for an hour--though not to confuse the reader: i personally did not detect any smoke elements within this beer just as i do not with regular gravedigger billy.  the finish is surprisingly dry with a balancing char before exhaling a touch of brownie crust. each new sip brings sweetly complex sherry on the tip of the tongue. however that sweetness never ceases to increase in intensity over the session. because of that i\m not entirely sure this is better than the younger gravedigger billy as the sweetness--which seems to thin it out as it warms--is a little beyond my typical threshold but it\s still absolutely delicious.
1926,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.52,happy to have yet another new revolution barreled-up beer again in a 12 oz. can. bring them on. bring them all on. by the case.  the pour is significantly darker than the base beer dark brown when viewed like a normal human with a beating blood-red heart when held up to the light. nose hews closer: bourbon caramel bourbon. bourbon.  v.s.o. gravedigger scorches. bourbon kicks me in the palate & continues down throwing haymakers everywhere. caramel & toffee hang on & try not to get runned on over. molasses brown sugar an echo of plums are all thrown off in small quantities. the finish is mostly booze; strangely i get zero oak or wood. rich but harsh. i’m going to lobby for 16 oz. cans in 2024.  gravedigger billy is an excellent beer & this additional craziness of aging & increased abv (albeit slightly) adds a bit but doesn’t change the game. not to belittle: this is a fantastic beer.
1927,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.57,canned 4/4/23. poured at 54°. quick light brown fizz vanished in a couple of seconds leaving no cap retention ring nor lace; dark brown with ruby highlights; good clarity; no legs. nose is bourbon and caramel; raisins as beer warmed. sweet caramel malt bourbon oak toffee; burnt brown sugar; raisins. silky smooth feel; medium plus body; full mouth warmth/heat from 14.9% abv; light carbonation. overall delicious rich sweet and bourbon boozy.
1928,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.51,from a 12oz can . pours a dense dark copper color with a light khaki head . smell is barreldark fruits wood caramel and toffee. mouth has great barrel and bourbon notes with all the notes of a scotch ale in layers  datesfig raisinsmolassestoffeehas nice char notes vanilla really so many layers . the mouth feel is has heat is abv and barrel but all you want is another sip. this is a classic to the style and the best ba sa i’ve ever had
1929,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.31,pours a reddish brown small head fadesquickly no lacing. nose says dried fruit toffee caramel a bit of vanilla did i say booze? it tastes better than it smells. a bit thin but otherwise excellent. at 3x the cost of backwoods bastard i guess a can a year cant hurt cant take it with ya!
1930,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.6,look - black and thick with a nice tan head and good lacing smell - boozy bourbon woody caramel toffee taste - just like the smell but just fantastic! feel - full body lighter carb great mouth coating overall - taste like im drinking delicious hard liquor just delicious though!!!
1931,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.47,canned 4/4/23  this new scotch ale is quickly climbing the ranks of the ba ratings currently sitting at #3 for the style. i enjoy the og gravedigger billy quite a bit so i was more than happy to grab a few cans of this special variant when i saw it on tavour. let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is extremely boozy and fruity but still somewhat agile despite this. i’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon toffee apple brandy toasted walnut dry oak molasses brown sugar raisin black cherry peat smoke honey and biscuity malt  it’s not as boozy sweet in taste landing a surprisingly good balance for such a huge beer. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting peat smoke fig brown sugar molasses burnt caramel charred oak black cherry dark toast light bourbon and port wine. the swallow brings notes of sweet bourbon molasses black cherry fig dry oak burnt caramel brown sugar peat smoke tobacco light walnut and port wine  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a rich beer. finishes neutral but dried out over time and drinks well below its abv  this is fantastic stuff. the original is really good but this is just awesome all around. highly recommend
1932,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.19,dark clear mahogany red body opaque in the glass; no head per se a sparse broken thin ring around the circumference of the glass. nice aroma; dark malts infused with some bourbon and woody cask elements; charred oak and roasted grain. big sweet roasted grain flavor; boozy and woody; chewing tobacco; figs; light caramel. heavy sticky body.  this powerful boozy scotch ale kicks it big time. looks and aroma arent out of this world but the taste and mouthfeel are fantastic. from my point of view this beer is better than the sum of its parts.  pouring temperature: 46 °f: canning info: 04-04-2023 source: tavour
1933,Champale Golden,1.25,what made the company change  golden champale from the green bottles to the clear bottles. that was the worst thing you could have done!!!!! i was a loyal champale drinker. the clear bottles dont have the quality that the green bottles presented. i know others that have stop drinking it also. the clear bottles  taste like sugar water. what a let down!!! so i am contacting you wondering is it possible to order the golden champale (original ) in the green bottles. you should really consider  putting them in the green bottles. i know for some reason the color of those bottles make a difference. take a survey among your champale drinkers and see what you come up with .
1934,Champale Golden,3.72,24 ounce bottle into lager glass bottled on 7/23/2018. pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a foamy soda off white head with poor retention that reduces to a nothing very quickly. no glass lacing fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass. okay appearance. aromas of white grape juice roses wine cracker corn white bread white sugar and light herbal/grassy hops. nice aromas with good balance of grapes/wine flavors pale malt sugar and slight herbal hop notes; with good strength. taste of big white grape juice roses wine cracker corn white bread white sugar and light herbal/grassy hops. mild herbal/grassy bitterness and grape tang/tartness on the finish. lingering notes of white grape juice roses wine cracker corn white bread white sugar and light herbal/grassy hop notes of the finish for a good bit. very nice robustness and balance of grapes/wine flavors pale malt sugar and slight herbal hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitter/tartness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. very crisp/clean finishing. light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitter/tartness and carbonation. high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth fairly grainy and lightly syrupy/acidic/tangy balanced mouthfeel that is great. minimal warming alcohol for 5.4%. overall this is a very tasty flavored malt liquor. all around nice robustness and balance of grapes/wine flavors pale malt sugar and slight herbal hop flavors; very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink. very flavorful and not watery for the abv. not overly sweet from crisp carbonated dryness. tastes like a wine cooler more than a malt liquor but i rate on enjoyment for weird stuff like this. they did really well for whatever they were going for on the champagne-like flavor profile. a very enjoyable offering.
1935,Champale Golden,1.5,something that should have never existed though i guess there is a limited marked. tried it in fancy bottles in indianapolis once. beer should be beer flavored. period.
1936,Champale Golden,3.1,finding this was the brightest bright spot in my recent hellish roadtrip to savannah ga. been looking for it for years ever since i was little and my uncle would regale me with tails of a mystical beverage marketed to the very poor that was part malt liquor and part champagne.  i was expecting something awful--along the lines of the mythical meister brau which i still havent found--is surprisingly pretty okay. not just a regular malternative–you can pick up definite nodes of champagne yeast along with big nodes of artificial grape flavoring that taste not like dimetapp but like actual grape only artificial.
1937,Champale Golden,3,i originally entered champale golden and pink champale on beeradvocate years ago and the bros turned it down saying something like no way dude because i\d mentioned it was flavored with grape. i think i said something in my review that offended them along the lines of historically it was the first malternative but the truth remains that it was and still is - if you can find it (it\s production is limited now).  champale malt liquor starting with dry champale in 1939 was in fact advertised as a flavored malt beverage back in the \60\s.  more importantly my review also gave a quick history of the brew noting that it was brewed in trenton nj and that it helped save brewing in the area by allowing other dying brands to stay alive. additionally it was marketed directly to african americans as a poor man\s champagne which was somewhat unusual at the time and still retains a high level of interest.  so what\s it like? golden. clear. highly carbonated. fruity and sweet with notes of grape. that\s about it. i wouldn\t call it balanced but i really wouldn\t call it cloying either. it\s an interesting and unusual beer that also has a lot of history behind it. if you can find it you should try it just to see what it\s all about.
1938,Champale Golden,2.4,unearthed from a dank cooler in a run-down liquor store in wood river il outside of st. louis. celebrate tonight with champale... a finely brewed and unique flavored malt beverage in a class of its own. clear 24 oz. bottle neck stamped 120610.  into a large mug it sizzles with lively carbonation but not really enough to emulate champagne. anemic pale gold color with a finger of white foam that rapidly fades to a thin ring around the sides.  smells like 7-up and white grape juice definitely artificially sweetened. tastes and feels very similar to 7-up... fake lemon lime sweet bubbly astringent. there\s a undercurrent of swill in the aftertaste along with a chalky smarties candy sweetness. i\m getting flashbacks to college briefly experimenting with tequiza mike\s and similar artificially fruity alcopops. doesn\t really come across as a malt liquor with all the sweetener and flavoring dumped in. four loko and the like have gotta be edging champale off the market...
1939,Imperial Biscotti Break,3.25,bit of an oj simpson for me dark and bitter
1940,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.53,pours out of the can a midnight black-brown no light passes through it. a nice 2 fingers of tan head with great retention. smells of cocoa coffee and roasty malts. taste follows the nose fairly well with the coffee being the predominant flavor and the rich mouth feel is like velvet. the beer has a perfect carbonation for the style that achieves this sensation. im really glad i bought a four pack!
1941,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.43,in this rendition its a pint can emptied into a clear imperial pint glass. the entire contents fit almost perfectly as theres no extraordinary foam just a modest and enduring dark biege head. the color of the liquid is the standard black coffee brown no more no less. although the aroma is less than pungent there is some roasted barley to be had but the almond and vanilla additions just dont impress the nose. but what a wonderful drink! theres the sweet malt of a great stout upfront delivered within an incredibly rich body. now the nuances: theres coffee but its not overly bitter nor the dominating taste it can be even in good coffee stouts. the vanilla only slightly sweetens the brew but contributes as an extra layer not a major taste emphasis. almond inclusion adds body and another taste layer without changing the overall and likely adds even more body to a brew certainly not lacking thereof. its hard pressed to find a richer bodied stout than this one. maybe theres not great glass lacing but other than that this is one of the best 10+% abv brews out there. the alcohol is warming for sure but not harsh and barely noticeable to taste. this is a great member of its style.
1942,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.47,l: poured from a pint can into a sniffer - inky jet black pour with a huge head risen. about 3 fingers length to be exact. s: getting predominant aromas for vanilla along side with molasses slight roasty coffee chocolate and malt aromas. not getting much of the almond in this. t: getting a complexed mix of vanilla chocolate roasty coffee. you can taste the biscuit more so near the after taste of it all. getting some after tastes of velvet as well. almost similar to a chili brewed stout after taste to this. f: heavy bodied alcohol hides very well. sipper but easy to sip. the taste is so smooth and tasty it reminds me of a stout i had that had chili peppers brewed into it. o: this is a great stout for the price given. honestly its complexed but is very rich and easy to drink. this one ill be buying again in the near future.
1943,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.46,i tried a 10oz glass of this beer off the tapper at dry ground brewing as a guest tap in paducah kentucky. it poured an opaque dark with thin tan head that did not leave much lace. the scent had dark chocolate and gram cracker notes. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip. there was dark chocolate roast malt and biscotti cookie presence. the mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. overall it is a solid beer.
1944,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.35,pours a dark brown with a small tan cap and light lacing.  smells of coffee booze and toasted malt.  tastes of sweet toasted malt bitter coffee and a bit of caramel and vanilla. the finish is slightly bitter and very boozy warm.  this is a powerful well made not overly complicated not too cloy sipper. my first pour from the can was too cold in retrospect. this brew gets better as it warms.    medium heavy body with light carbonation. lush and syrupy mouthfeel.
1945,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.58,really good imperial stout! pronounced coffee smell and taste but not overpowering in regard to either. really nice and balanced vanilla and almond flavor!
1946,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.75,seconds after drinking taste biscotti soaked in coffee. not too sweet all features fit stout profile. excellent.
1947,Imperial Biscotti Break,3.72,pours a pitch black with 2 fingers of mocha foam. sheets of lacing reduce to a thin ring. nice oily legs on this one. nose is bitter coffee chocolate earth and biscuit. taste follows suit with the addition of some nutty notes and vanilla. feel is oily smooth and quite full. another good one from evil twin.
1948,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.81,you can smell and taste the biscotti so good not overly winey like old coffee that some imperials have. very smooth velvety mouth feel. i dont pour for head so i cant speak to that. you could wash down a donut or cinnamon roll with this my favorite stout right now.
1949,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.44,great for a lager witch what it realy is.
1950,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2,worst beer available in winnipeg next to kokanee.
1951,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.18,im not sure ive given this good a score to a beer that everyone else (per the ba average) felt was so poor. but i must say this beer did its job: refreshing after 90 minute flight delays in chicago and a bumpy bus ride from calgary airport into the rockies.  more important than my review is my remark that i find it funny the brewer calls this an ipa (i presume in the british tradition since nova scotia is close geographically and spiritually) and ba has 697 reviews with american blonde styling. it also should be noted that untappd averages this as a 3 rating and bas average is 2.63. something screwy going on here since i find ba usually .25 above untappds average. not to quibble; but remember beer is to be enjoyed first and analyzed second.  and since alexander keith is the pride of nova scotia they deserve better than average overall hugs from me. i went on their website and they are genuine for 200 years.
1952,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3,12 oz bottle. pours golden with white head. aroma is of sweet fruit and bready malt. body is medium and crisp. floral hops bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. medium dry finish. ok brew.
1953,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.34,people dont understand that this is not the english ipa first brewed by alexander keith in halifax back in 1820 (the first ipa brewed in north america). until anheuser-busch got their claws into it this was a heavily-hopped all malt (no corn) mash ipa. now it is a weak-flavoured lightly-hopped 5% abv blonde lager which meets none of the criteria for an ipa. this is not the beer i drank at university not even a pale (forgive the pun) imitation. it is thin light with no lacing and a taste typical of anheuser-busch swill. might as well be drinking bud light (but no one really drinks that its just an urban legend just like the notion that there are people who actually drink moxie). this was my go-to beer back many decades ago but now i wouldnt touch it.
1954,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,1,so i rated this as an ipa. much like if someone showed you a cow and asked you to rate it as a horse. so as an ipa this is terrible. as a lager it is good.
1955,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,4.7,all the complaints about wanting this beer to be an ipa or i was tricked needs to understand this isn\t a real ipa. hell this was one of the first mainstream ipa\s out there. it\s brewed like an ipa and was supposed to make the journey to india and ferment but instead it just gots sold in nova scotia and became the standard beer. not reaching that fermentation it doesn\t hit the same as a real ipa buts boy does it do the trick and many a nights where you just come home reeking of this fine working mans beer. stops comparing it to sierra nevada ipa its in the class with the beers that put hair on your chests like miller lite and coors lite.
1956,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.99,good autumn/winter beer. can see myself drinking these on a crisp day at the golf course.
1957,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.29,i bought a can at the lcbo in ontario 473ml at 5%. my can was very fresh the letter e which stands for may 2021 brewed . poured a 2finger head into glass that was leaving a lace as you drink it. i expected more sweetness when i see india pale ale on the can but its not that sweet at all . overall its an easy drinking beer more like a lagered ale then a ipa beer to me . cheers.
1958,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.29,beer tastes like lager and apple.  if you were to drink this at a bar it would taste like a bad beer.  i am whelmed with this beer and the facilities that it gives me.
1959,Michelob Golden Draft Light,2.28,16 oz draft pour at a twins game. i was intrigued by the first sip which showed this beer is more flavorful than and superior to bud light. however a few sips in my interest dropped to near zero. ultimately its still a watery light beer with hints of barley malt. and maybe hops. maybe not. who can say?
1960,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.48,16oz aluminum can purchased at busch stadium and consumed from the bottle. smells vaguely beery. the taste is very light malt a hint of orchard fruit and lightly tart. no real bitterness or hop presence. very light bodied with high carbonation and a mostly dry fairly clean finish. overall ok but id rather have bought a 30 pack of hamms for the money...
1961,Michelob Golden Draft Light,4.74,its a good tasting beer the new can looks good!
1962,Michelob Golden Draft Light,1.19,12oz bottle eb oct 22/22 into a 12oz becher. l: pours light radiant clear yellow w a thin white head going quickly to edge foam lite carbo no lacing. s: corn grains clean & simple. t: grains a hint of caramelized malts lite bitterness adjunct waft at finish. does not taste well-blended. f: lightly brisk cola-like clean somewhat smooth lite bodied fast lightly dirty finish that is a little dry. o: it is slightly more rich than other light aal beers in this style but the taste of this beer does not appeal to me. esp the adjunct flavors in the finish. i believe there are other better tasting and more satisfying beers in this style that should be sought out.
1963,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.25,my second favorite light beer. beats out natural light (my #3) for better body and smoother finish in my opion. beats miller coors and bud lights hands down. for the record lienenkugals light is my #1.
1964,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.84,appearance: pours a completely clear light pale golden color with a mild white head. srm of 5-6. (3.75)  aroma: mild to moderate aromas of pale malts white bread malts some white adjuncts on teh finish but has a full-bodied aroma.  flavor: mild flavors of pale malts white cracker lots of yeast. a smooth light honey malt sweetness on the end but also finishes dry. finishes smooth.  feel: medium to light bodied. strong carbonation a smooth malt sweetness on the end.  compared to miller light 7/29/21: pours a slighty lighter color. more cracker and dry yeast aromas. less corn and adjunct malts. dryer and cleaner.  overall: better than i expected for a light adjunct lager. this one drinks with a nice balance of carbonation yeast and sweet malts on the finish. a pretty nice light beer. hard to beat miller light in a beer contest but this one was pretty good. (final rating: 3.84)
1965,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.6,pours a clear light golden yellow color. smell is grain and barley wth some malts. taste has slight hops with some grassy notes cracker bread malts . mouth feel is crisp and refreshing its an aal so to style very tasty crisp and drinkable .
1966,Michelob Golden Draft Light,2.7,light straw. smallest hint of light malt on the nose. same in the flavor. wow thats a boring beer. slightest spice. technically refreshing but so is water.
1967,Michelob Golden Draft Light,4.15,smells like biscuits. mouthfeel is crisp and cold
1968,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.2,poured from can into a pint glass  appearance – the beer is pours a light golden color with a billowy white head of fizzy foam. the head fades very fast to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.  smell – the aroma of the beer is light overall but consists of some cracker and bread as well as a bit of corn and caramel sweetness. there is a little bit of light hop as well as some light papery aromas.  taste – the taste begins light and crisp with a cracker and lightly corn and caramel sweetened taste. the tastes are light upfront (appropriate for a light brew) and continue so throughout. there is a little loss of sweetness as the taste advances and along with some increases in a grassy hop and a little bit of grainy malt flavor one is left with a light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue.  mouthfeel – the body of the brew is quite light and thin with a carbonation level that is high. for the light brew style the feel is great and makes this an easy drinking session style brew overall.  overall – for the style this is a rather decent light adjunct. not super flavorful but low cal easy drinking crisp and sessionable.
1969,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3,tastes better cold - from a can get some barley on the nose; tasting it gets me barley with a finish of hops. it definitely gets the job done and is better than the heavy version.
1970,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.73,had bottles. 1 into a 7oz taster. l: pours fairly gold and clear w a thin white head some big carbo bubbles head recedes a little lacing. s: spicy hops caramel malts grains lightly earthy & sweet. t: follows aroma with corn sweet malts and hops well balanced. it is lightly metallic. f: a gentle crisp hop snap then smooth & malty w some caramel sweetness in the medium bodied center. it has a med-fast finish that is lightly drying. o: a very easy drinking pale lager that is nice straight from the bottle. they go quick. a nice year-round beer ive seen only a few times. it is lightly sweet and okay in its style.
1971,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.48,i used to enjoy this beer---i drank it real cold and real fast (being a small bottle it works well for this.) apparently its not very good based on other reviews. but i enjoyed it!
1972,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.17,i recently got this beer. it pours golden a little bit hazy with a very mild white foam head. aroma is very sweet malty and some adjuncts no hops. taste is very sweet lots of residual sugars there overwhelming and not very refreshing. it´s a very good looking bottle with a poor content.
1973,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.12,poured from a 16oz can.  bit of sweetness makes this actually not too bad.
1974,Palate Wrecker,3.94,shared 12 fl. oz. bottle kindly provided by abemorsten. abv is 9.5%. hazy orange colour large white head. strong aroma of orange marmalade and fruity and resinous american hops. the flavour is indeed a palate wrecker - that is why this beer was chosen as the last beer of the evening at our tasting. extremely hoppy flavour but still in its own weird way fairly well balanced - mainly because the malty sweetness seems just right. to stand up to the hoppiness. grapefruit resin / pine and spruce. yes it is a typically american double ipa and i’ve seen it before- but still: oh so good! halleluja!
1975,Palate Wrecker,4.25,as bitter as they come.
1976,Palate Wrecker,4,from old undated notes. poured from the bottle.  bright orange color.  small white head; no lacing.  smells strongly of high grade marijuana.  medium mouthfeel bordering on thick.  taste is of grapefruit and great ganja. booze is present but not overpowering.  a delicious beer.
1977,Palate Wrecker,4.06,good solid imperial ipa. not up there with the best but nice and solid. in tap at industry public house on leahs b-day weekend in pittsburgh! good ending for lunch!  add: 7/29/20. trip home from lancaster after joy and andys wedding. yes.... its a palate wrecker!
1978,Palate Wrecker,4.19,from notes 3/9/13: pours clear golden amber producing 2 fingers of frothy variously bubbled moderately lasting off-white head that leaves streaks and webs of lace. aroma is sweet caramel malt with vanilla resinous pine grapefruit and other citrus with a hint of pineapple. taste is hop forward resinous pine grapefruit lemon and orange pith and zest backed by caramel malt sweetness with pineapple and spice (alcohol?) in a bitter finish. there is a tea-like herbal bitterness throughout. starts bittersweet and finishes super bitter and dry. aftertaste is resinous oily hop bitter with some malt sweetness. mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation creamy drying oily and drawing.
1979,Pearl River Lager Beer,3.68,smells like unripe feijoas!  nice lager! smooth drop so dont drink it fast because it will put you on your ass!  although nice semi warm its a dream if nicely chilled but do try it for yourself.  if you like tsingtao you will convert.  if you can tolerate kingfisher then i think youd like the taste of this beauty.
1980,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.09,horrible!
1981,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.66,poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of green apples grains not a good sign. taste is green apples some grains a bit of vinegar kind of bland. feels light in the mouth and overall is not terrible but not to my liking.
1982,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.75,i had this beer while travelling in china on business in april 2015. likely to never get there again so i decided to try as many different china brewed beers as i could. this was 1 of 6 beers i tried in my travels and in doing my research before departing the states this was considered a top 10 china (euro lager) beer! the abv was 5.3 according to my language assistant. i poured from a clear glass 600ml bottle after purchasing at a restaurant; quite a different look from the picture depicted. a - mellow yellow with very slight head and almost no carbination s - grainy mild to the nose t - watery and bland with some sweetness f - light no lacing and thin  if you must have a beer while in china then give it a go - but it is not much to write home about!
1983,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.47,format: a 330ml dark green bottle with a pretty ordinary macro label. looks... suspicious.  appearance: pours out a fairly thin-looking light yellow with okay carbonation. a fizzing white head drops from a finger almost immediately. doesnt look great.  aroma: there is a touch of cereal grain there but much more adjuncts - particularly rice. smells cheap if not offensive.  taste: i dont mind some asian adjunct beers - some actually make the rice taste quite nice. this is not one of those beers. an awkward fug from the rice and only cheap and light cereals to back it up.  aftertaste: more rice awkwardness on the finish. not a great beer.  mouth feel: light in body to the point of being somewhat watery with a moderate to higher carbonation.  overall: a fairly cheap lager at au$38 a case but there are better quality beers even at this level. id rather spend a few bucks more and get some vb.
1984,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.26,drank it directly from an ice cold can (thats how you drink macro lager). 4.3% abv.  typical adjunct with very minor skunky taste. poor malt presence plenty of rice though.  good to go with chinese food. especially crayfish stirfried with szechuan peppercorn.
1985,Pearl River Lager Beer,3,touch of grain some bit of skunk definitely more beery than the weaker pearl river beers with some extra bitterness that\s not entirely metallic. quaffable cheap.
1986,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.67,330ml can from yue hwa chinatown singapore (sgd$ 2.30): light golden straw that is clear and thin with a bubbly white head on top that sets as a patchy lacing that barely covers half of the surface area.  sweet with water and light grassy hops making up most of the rest. there are a few adjuncts but thats about it and it is very light.  water with a hint of sweetness and the faintest of grassy hops on top. there is a bit of biterness but not much else to speak of other than a hint of citrus towards the end.  thin and light with medium carbonation and a strange semi-sweet feel with a hint of skunk and bitterness.  a very poor beer and up there with some of the worst i have tried although by no means the very worst. the beer was cheap and thin with little in the way of taste or smell.
1987,Serpent's Stout,4.02,l: jet black pour from a 1 pint 9 fl oz bottle into a sniffer - thick motor oil appearance. foam appeared (approx 1 fingers length). not much lacing left behind as it dissolves. s: aromas of dark malt molasses earthy spices chocolate slight vanilla along with toffee. t: just like the smell indicated big on the sweet dark malts for this. getting some chocolate a bit of cola taste in the mix with some molasses in there. slight coffee as well in this. f: heavy bodied a good sipper. not the easiest to drink but for the right taste buds it can be. o: i enjoyed this stout i personally love my stouts to be more chocolate forward less malty but this one is excellent in its own ways. definitely worth the try. o:
1988,Serpent's Stout,4,you breathe i breathe - there is no god that has a grander breath. we exist as humans - as humans… living just to live - but i also hope living for some greater good. not me vs you. and not you vs me. just people. as people. and hell…can’t we just be?
1989,Serpent's Stout,4.36,fantastic stout. heavy roasted malts is the predominant flavor with just enough chocolate to round it out. maybe a hint of coffee and cola. if you are looking for a stout on the toasty charred spectrum this is fantastic.
1990,Serpent's Stout,4.44,a: silky dark jet black color. no light penetrates. thin tan head that is no more than a film (as youd expect from the abv)  s: loads of rich roasted malts. milk and dark chocolate. sweet licorice molasses toffee. a hint of vanilla and oak. earthy leather and a hint of cola. a nice mild touch of dark fruit and fig sweetness at the end. rich decadent and complex aroma  t: roasted malts sweet cola and dark chocolate. a mild hop bitterness asserts itself after that as well as a little bit of bitterness from the roast. milk chocolate and cocoa powder follow that. molasses and faint dark fruits. leather and a little tobacco hiding out in here too.  m: full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation  o: absolutely awesome imperial stout. rich complex yet very easy to drink for 11%. this beer is an absolute treat for sure
1991,Serpent's Stout,4.51,completely black body with hazelnut colored foam with an irregular but creamy grain and good persistence. elegant bouquet of dark fruit and caramel leather toasted wheat and coffee chocolate and hints of vanilla and wood. sweet entry caramel chocolate plum raisins great roasting notes and an earthy hopping finish. medium body and not too viscous fine and medium intensity carbonation. aftertaste of ash licorice and coffee with a return of chocolate with a gentle ethyl embrace.
1992,Tiger Beer,2.37,for reasons that are completely unclear to me this crappy lager is very popular in southeast asia. so thought i should order a bottle at a restaurant in hoi-an last night.  the beer pours the expected golden amber color with a white frothy head and light lacing. head retention is fair at best. on the nose i really dont get much of anything. maybe some black pepper and some cereal grains along with some faint sandalwood. mouthfeel is more of the same in this very light and watery beer. the finish (what there is of it) is fairly dry with minimal bitterness. alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. i know its only 5% but i would have guessed it was even lower than that. so i guess this beer would be good for washing down salty or spicy food. it really is pretty watery stuff.  this beer was so lousy that i ended up getting a heineken after a bottle of this stuff (it was the only other option at the restaurant). the heinie sucked as well but it was slightly better than the tiger beer. would not order this beer ever again.
1993,Tiger Beer,2,500ml can purchased in canada. full bodied and flavourful but not very good overall. a lot of flavour for a lager but the flavour just isnt good. not a lot of carbonation. has a bit of a gasoline aroma and taste especially when it warms up a bit sort of reminiscent of a malt liquor.
1994,Tiger Beer,3.03,pours a slightly cloudy pale golden coloratrion with a medium frothy quickly receding head and slightly visible carbonation. smells of light crackery malt and grassy hops with hints of honey. taste is a decent balance of light crackery grainy malt and grassy slightly floral hops with hints of honey and straw. finishes with a light bitterness and some grassy hops and honey lingering in the aftertaste. smooth mouthfeel with a light body and medium/strong carbonation.  im not saying that this is a great beer but for what it is it actually came as a pretty positive surprise to me. maybe its because im having this rather fresh but its quite a crisp refreshing lager that goes down easy in the sweltering heat. it may not be all that flavourful but what do you expect from a euro lager? certainly better than any aal ive ever had while its not overly sweet with some decent grassy floral hops and a light bitterness noticeable in the finish. pretty light-bodied for the abv though.
1995,Tiger Beer,2.61,exactly what you would expect of a mass produced lager… little flavor little aroma no head looks more like a pilsner. the label says full -bodied… i can’t find the body
1996,Tiger Beer,1.95,tastes like sugar and water. no malt no hop.
1997,Tiger Beer,2.88,clear yellow appearance fast fading head no lacing. sweet malty vegetal aroma. crisp fairly clean (as long as it stays chilled) corn taste with a miniscule hop presence. light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel leading to a short lived finish.
1998,Pilsner Urquell,3.74,from a 16.9oz can pours a light amber/gold with a fluffy white head and looks perfect for the style (which i guess it should being the og). smell is of lager malt and saaz hops. taste was lacking at first but finished with a nice bitterness. taking time to chew the beer brought out more flavors of citrus pepper and grass. quite nice but less than i was expecting from its reputation.
1999,Pilsner Urquell,3.5,this is not what i remembered from drinking this in my youth. i guess not many things are! it is ok but i like other modern pilsners better than this. oh well...
2000,Pilsner Urquell,4,an enjoyable family matters themed beer.  style: czech pilsner | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 4.4% | rating: 4
2001,Pilsner Urquell,4.04,crushable and smooth yet excellently full-flavored. delightful. na zdraví!
2002,Pilsner Urquell,3.69,a good pilsner (the original for that matter); it yields only 4.4% abv but it doesn’t seem like it once you’ve downed a couple. the smell is pleasant and the color is a nice solid gold. this beer is very easy drinking yet boasts a complex array of flavors that come to you over time. from hoppy bread tastes to a sour dry finish.
2003,Pilsner Urquell,4.83,the original pilsner:  just because youre the first doesnt mean youre the best.  the above statement doesnt apply to this beer and theres not a bad thing i can say about this beer. one wouldnt be out of line in saying pilsner urquell is #1.  a crisp and refreshing yet sippable and full flavored pilsner.
2004,Pilsner Urquell,4.33,poured from a pint can into a frosty cold mug. not too malty not overly crisp good amount of hops with a slight bitterness in the finish. goldilocks would be a fan. its just right.
2005,Pilsner Urquell,3.84,not as much pilsner malt in the aroma or taste which is what i like in a pilsner but overall its a very good beer
2006,Pilsner Urquell,5,just came back from a trip to europe where i visited czechia and germany. i had the opportunity to taste/drink/guzzle pilsner urquell filtered and unfiltered at plzen. i have to say it tastes nothing like the cans or bottles sold in the us. this beer has no equal in taste mouth feel and character. it made me change the way i see lagers. this beer is rich with nuanced flavor that changes from the sweet moment the solid white foam touches your lips through the hop bitterness that hits you at the back of your tongue to the floral accents felt in your nose when exhaling. it felt like a snack when just drinking it at a bar and like another dish when having it with a meal. i also had german lagers on the same trip and while these are fantastic pilsner urquell is in my opinion the queen of all beer.
2007,Pilsner Urquell,5,die besten
2008,Pilsner Urquell,4.31,excellent beer.
2009,Pilsner Urquell,4.5,its only fault is its low abv. are bottles here as good as on tap in czech? ...nope but again tap reigns (if they keep their tubes clean). still trying to find an american pilsner that has that same loving bite and taste. looking up the steps they use to produce it not sure if doubling the hops (homebrewing) will make things come close. im going to give it a try though as it is an unparalleled ale.
2010,Double Jack,4,big. bold up front aroma and taste but goes down easy. amber color with nice creamy head hoppy smell and slick mouthfeel. this is how a double ipa should taste.
2011,Double Jack,3.75,yellowish color. herbal aromas and flavor notes. otherwise a fairly average ipa. im not sure i understand the high marks this beer gets.
2012,Double Jack,3.69,** 07/27/21  can to sniftet.  clear.  lots of pine. smooth and a touch sweet. biscuit malt.  **
2013,Double Jack,4.09,pours a very light hazy amber ample carbonation and a short lived head. a 12 ounce can dated 9/11/20 so over six months old. first time to find it locally so i bought it. it has grapefruit aroma and not particularly strong. taste is all hops. mostly grapefruit and pine. definitely of the west coast variety. i imagine it much crisper if it were fresh. i get some resin in the tongue. a hint of sweetness in there too. overall i think age took its toll but still tastes good and id like to give it another chance when i can get it fresh.
2014,Double Jack,4.24,a-orange/gold minimal head as expected with the high abv s-smells like a a west coast double t-tastes as advertised too. relatively malt-forward but never overly so. the grapefruit and pine stay up front where they belong. above average bitter. m-slightly above avg carbonation. medium body. o-one of the better wc dipas ive enjoyed despite the six month age. fresh this thing would be killer.
2015,Double Jack,3,bought a variety 12-pack $15.98 foodland 85 days old smell of citrus and pine light amber color medium mouthfeel medium carbonation taste of alcohol dominates with some citrus and bitterness flavors overall not that great. i think high abv beers that hide their alcohol well are good so this isnt it. very unbalanced. would not buy again.
2016,§ucaba,4.32,2018 vintage sipped on march 24 2023 in a stout snifter glass.  dark brown with deep red highlights. a near 1f cap appears briefly before settling to a thick rim film. a few spots of lacing surprisingly.  oak aged bourbon and booze aroma up front. toasted dark bread malts chocolate and caramel.  flavors of bourbon soaked toast and malt vanilla dark chocolate and a touch of cherry wine.  big and boozy body yet quite smooth. there’s a light touch of carbonation and the dark chocolate slips in the finish.  an incredibly well aged barley wine ale. a nice tug of war between strong booze and mellow sips.
2017,§ucaba,4.53,vintage 2018 poured from bottle into tulip good 2+ finger head recedes rather quickly to a small pool so so lacing. jet black in the glass no light gets thru. big barrel on the nose caramel toffee and dried fruits good nose. taste follows the nose big bourbon on the front big hit of malt sweetness creamy caramel some raisin plum on the tail end and finishes with a good assertive bitterness. residual bourbon caramel left on the palate.
2018,§ucaba,4.27,12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter. 2018 vintage drank january ‘23  caramel brown with a half inch of short lived tan foam. some suspended sediment from the second pour. malty sweet aroma caramel bread dark fruit and some mild alcohol. tastes much the same with the addition of toffee/molasses type sweetness and a touch of metallic tang. it is sweet but a clean bitter finish keeps the sweetness well in check. medium body low carination smooth and soft closing with a warm alcohol bite.  this has held up well. but the ba character is gone and i’m guessing some of the hop flavor has disappeared but oxidative flavor really only a small metallic tang is low. drinks easy considering the high abv.
2019,§ucaba,4.38,2018 release consumed 8/22/22  rightfully a classic of the style. the 2018 bottle is very smooth and although i taste the alcohol its very easy to drink. the bourbon is definitely there and wonderfully balanced. as it should be the mouthfeel is thinner than a ba stout. this is a wonderful world class beer and always worth having on your shelf or fridge.
2020,§ucaba,4.54,had the 2018 version on tap at other half dc  dark mostly opaque reddish brown still somewhat see through tan head.  raisin boozy maple toffee oak fig jam on the nose. taste follows but with some coffee bitterness to go with the fig raisin clove toasted sugar chocolate.  probably best barleywine i’ve ever had boozy but not over powering somehow everything seems in place (where i often find barley wines to be unbalanced in one way or another)
2021,§ucaba,4.5,12 ounce bottle 2019 vintage. 01/19/2019 is stamped on the neck of the bottle im assuming thats the bottled on date. served in a snifter the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head. head retention and lacing are both good. i like the aroma the brew smells like bourbon vanilla brown sugar coconut cherry and oak. really sweet and malty smelling. for the most part i think the taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of some raisin fig and chocolate flavors. its sweet tasting but not overpowering at all. mouthfeel/body is full its coating and easy to drink with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. if youre into english style barleywines then definitely pick this one up im glad i did!
2022,§ucaba,4.94,2018 sucaba enjoyed november 2021.  rich warm intense cola brown in the glass. light aroma with toasted coconut standing out. thick almost excessively so with a long finish. there’s a hint of hops on the end sticky and sharp.
2023,§ucaba,4.54,no head hazy caramel brown body. smell is rich— bourbon whisky dominates with caramel malt figs tobacco and a healthy rye spice. taste is more subtle than expected. figs brown sugar whisky cherry just a hint of coconut vanilla and lots of rye spice. smooth drinking. nice alcohol warmth. not as overpowering as expected which is good. it has balance and plenty of going on. what an amazing sipper. if i had a cellar i’d jump on another bottle.
2024,Crème Brûlée,4,poured into a chalice: color is black head is light tan and presents with the nitro super fine bubbles on that initial pour.  smell is lightly boozy upfront quickly overtaken by the creaminess - big lactose really has that creamy aroma some backing chocolate and roast.  taste is similar but the booziness is a backing flavor: big cream lactose lighter chocolate some roast booze. flavor really emanates a thick cocktail like flavor.  mouthfeel is low nitro effervescence strong/thick creamy sweetness limited bitterness and even limited drying from the strength.  overall a big creamy sweet brew that gives off a creamy cocktail vibe (white russian-esque).
2025,Crème Brûlée,3.84,this is just sweeter than the hot cocoa one but thats really about the whole super prevalent difference. i feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less. sweet boozy run of the mill. southern tier is super overrated as a whole to me. theres great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere. try something new. i will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas. at least this is supposed to be sweet.
2026,Crème Brûlée,4.62,experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers. now its time for a critical review. two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass imperial pint mug. theres an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head preventing the entire drainage of the second can is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world. it adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid thats opaque but reasonably bright. behind the sharp vanilla nose hit found is creamy sweetness kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. for its color theres very little reference to roasted malt. there is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. so much so that it detracts from the intended target. but its a mild infraction as theres enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. actually the stout bitterness doesnt really kick until the finish. until then this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert without the crusty covering. theres great glass lacing and a well disguised 10% abv. maybe not perfect but this is one great desert beer.
2027,Crème Brûlée,4.05,650 ml bottle as southern tier imperial crème brûlée stout courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 10.0%. pitch black colour big tan head. intense aroma of crème brûlée and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle amazing! the smell includes caramel of course - but also chocolate and mild coffee. the sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again but also roasty notes of strong coffee dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. warming mouthfeel. an incredible dessert beer!
2028,Crème Brûlée,4.45,looks: at 9.6 ozs. should have poured it into a smaller glass. lol. nice thick creamy head about 1/2 inch tall. great lacing on the glass. smooth tan on top and strong black coffee color on the bottom. smell and taste: this beer really does resemble creme brûlée. vanilla and burnt sugar on cream. great combination. feel: nitro makes it smooth and soft. overall: this its one of the easiest beers i have ever had the pleasure of drinking. bumped the oa score down some because of the short pour. should have ben packaged in a can the size of a pint. at least it would have come closer to filling my glass. i would definitely drink this one again but as an after dinner drink like desert.
2029,Crème Brûlée,4,sweet and choclaty to the nose. sweet chocolate taste with a vanilla finish. great dessert beer.
2030,Crème Brûlée,3.83,pours a cola brown color with a very creamy beige head 1/4” cap was present for the duration.  nose is seriously sweet with caramel brown sugar sweet cream and vanilla bean.  flavor begins with caramel and vanilla roasted coffee flavor comes on to offer some balance. boozy alcohol warmth plays in the background the whole time.  finish leans toward the bitter from the coffee the sweetness and alcohol warmth are still there though.  viscous body and subtle carbonation let this one hang on the palate a little but it’s a desert beer in every way so this wasn’t surprising.  not a daily drinker good to keep a few on hand for the colder months though.
2031,Crème Brûlée,4.34,pours quite dark and fairly clear appropriate head. aroma is dark roasted malts and vanilla. actually tastes like a creme brûlée - complete with the sugary vanilla and the burnt sugar on the finish. nicely done. carbonation is appropriate. obverse a nicely crafted beer hits all the marks.  11/22/20 bomber no date at least 5 years old. 4.5 rating
2032,Crème Brûlée,2.21,the initial smell is quite nice. but then you take a sip. utterly disgusting. i tried a second can same. the sheer number of positive reviews required me to sign up and leave a review. im still trying to get the after taste out of my mouth. absolutely do not recommend.
2033,Grodziskie,4.53,poured cold from a pint can into a pilsner flute. pale straw colored body with a thick white long-lasting three-finger head. excellent retention and lacing. light wheat malt backbone light in body and very refreshing with a little tart apple and some pleasant bitterness on the finish. also a great table beer. but the stars of the show here are the intense smoky aromas and flavors particularly those of smoked ham and bacon. i was hoping against hope that this would be the case and goldfinger absolutely nailed it. smoked beers may not be everyone\s cup o\ joe but i can\t recommend this one highly enough. what else is there to say except na zdrowie!
2034,Grodziskie,4.18,16 oz can from binny’s. canned 6/25/2023 enjoyed 7/24/2023. pours very pale yellow heavy head good retention and lacing. smoke is noticeable just the right level for this style. at only 3.3% abv this is eminently sessionable especially on a beautiful summer evening. kudos goldfinger and live oak.
2035,Grodziskie,4,canned 6/26/23; drank 7/2/23 @ the yarchives.  cloudy pale yellow appearance.  a rough pour yielded a nice white head; frothy tree-rung lace.  campfire smoke & mild corn notes in the nose.  medium thin mouthfeel.  mild flavors of campfire smoke & some soft wheat.  pleasant but one is enough.
2036,Grodziskie,4.49,16oz tall boy poured into riverlands dimpled mug  canned on date: 7/27/21.  appearance: translucent very pale yellow body. massive bone white head. tons of lacing clinging to the glass.  smell: lightly toasted cereal grain and lightly spicy hops.  taste: light cereal grains. honey sweetness. light smoke that is a touch meaty. hint of lemon and spicy hop. everything is crazy balanced. no hotdog water here thats for sure!  mouthfeel: light body. moderate carbonation levels. soft and airy body. this is insanely crushable. honestly this might be the lightest fluffiest lager that i have tried in a long long time potentially ever...  overall: outstanding collaboration between goldfinger and live oak! this is probably my favorite beer from goldfinger to date. this one blew me away. seriously!
2037,Grodziskie,4.64,had on tap. this is the best grodziskie i have had so far hands down. pale yellow body with two fingers of white foam with periodic spotted lacing. aromas of smoke campfire grains toast wheat lemon zest light yeast and herbs. taste has a base of wheat grains cracker and toast that the wonderful smoked character bonds with giving off camp fire light dry earth with a striking finish of lemon zest and herbal hops. has nuance with plenty of smoke really impressive! feel is light and smoky with a sneaky thick finish with some graininess but the middle is a tiny bit thinner than some other grodziskies i have tried. amazing grodziskie will be the measure by which others are compared
2038,Grodziskie,4.06,had this on tap at goldfingers first lagerversary. i can see why this would not be for some people. it has a very low abv 3.2% and it had a very smokey aroma and taste. after a couple sips you kinda of get use to the smoke flavor and start to notice how smooth the beer is. i kind of liked this one but i probably would not want more than one at as time. it was certainly different.
2039,Grodziskie,4.5,pours an effervescent cloudy light golden straw color. however it soon clears up and the resulting appearance is a crystal clear straw color. thick three or four finger white head forms on the beer lingers for a bit then dissipates until just a thin layer of white sudsy foam remains.  aroma has notes of smoked beachwood malt light campfire notes white bread with a hint of herbal hoppines on the back end.  taste follows the nose with notes of smoked malts white bread campfire smoke giving way to a very mild tanginess with a mild hop bitterness on the back end. its unabashedly smokey but weirdly balanced given the light character of the beer. the lovely hop bitterness in this harkens back to old school grodziskie that was much hoppier than many of the examples that are brewed today.  feel is light crisp and lively. bright carbonation. the finish is light and fleeting.  overall this is an incredible beer - delicious and an excellent example of the style.
2040,Gulden Draak,4.53,in a word.... wow .... like a desert in a glass ... i think this is a one and done meaning have one and then youre done .... incredibly easy to drink and super potent .. dark malty carmely etc .... much love
2041,Gulden Draak,4.18,poured reddish brown tan head that dissipated quickly. the aroma was lost on my covid damaged nose. the taste was a bit sweeter than expected and had the bready malts and candied fruit. for the abv it is too easy to drink. the feel was surprisingly active with the lack of head i wasn’t expecting the tingling aspect. oa seriously easy drinking tasty and a treat. if not for the abv i’d drink these all the time.
2042,Gulden Draak,4.68,l - reddish brown with a large tan head that sticks around leaving behind a ton of lacing s - belgian yeast candi sugar fruit esters dates and figs honey t - follows the nose: bready belgian yeast and candi sugar up front and throughout intermixed well with fruit esters - dates and figs honey some caramel light spices f - medium bodied with high carbonation o - a fantastic belgian - maybe more of a strong dark ale vs a red triple but very good nonetheless
2043,Gulden Draak,3.98,dark burnt amber to brown with a pink-ish tan head that dies quickly to a thin fuzzy ring.  caramelized gingersnap meets a hint of candy apple before coming to a boozy rum-like finish.
2044,Gulden Draak,4.21,330ml stubby bottle into a tulip. code of 25jv whatever that means.  fine looking dark reddish body with an impressive off white head leaving thick lacing. sweet aroma with matching flavor. strong without being boozy warming malty. a light dark fruit taste with a featherlight bitter note late in the finish.
2045,Gulden Draak,4.03,very good beer. i prefer chimay blue but this beer seems to improve with every sip. it is a little sweet but not overly so and has a great body and a finish that stays with you. drank in a teku glass from a bottle but would love to taste this on tap.
2046,Gulden Draak,4.16,365ml bottle  carbonation has the bottle overflowing once i crack the lid. pours two fingers of dense tan head into my snifter. retention is very nice but does eventually fade. lacing is subpar. body is a deep reddish brown. looks decent.  nose has plenty of sweetness with notes of fig and plum. tart esters quickly appear and add a much needed balance reminiscent of cherries. no clove. smells massive as you’d expect. a little on the sweet side for me but i can dig it.  flavor blasts you with a massive dose of stone fruit has a sweet impression but drinks very clean. maybe a touch of tart cherries in the background. overall it’s still not my go-to style but it’s impressive and certainly something i would not turn down.  the carbonation is medium by the time i go looking for it don’t recall it being insanely high to begin with. sweetness is apparent but pretty modest compared to what it could be; well attenuated. bitterness is low and only really shows up briefly in the finish with the tart fruit. has some body but comes through surprisingly light given the modest sugar and carbonation. overall the mouthfeel stays reasonable and it brings a somewhat smooth feel that supports the beer nicely.  all things considered the drinkability is very very nice. there is zero alcohol and the sweetness is in check.  between the flavor and the mouthfeel the beer drinks even better than it smells. very nice.
2047,Natty Daddy (6%),1.19,when you want a beer really bad ab/inbev has a really bad beer for you. no foamy head no lacing has one strong distinct flavor note which is fusel alcohol. which meets gasoline. unrefined and crude as a american basically malt liquor gets. a hit on a hot summer day at the trailer park. ill drink water when i am desperate before i will drink this crap. has the worst aftertaste this side of lithuania and the worst headache and hangover ever. if its the end of the month youre on a cheapie budget buy decent malt liquor instead. olde english 800 colt 45 or mickeys is 1000 times better and somewhat drinkable. and as cheap. be forewarned. if i could give this negative point ratings i would.
2048,Natty Daddy (6%),1.37,i had never seen it before but i had to try it. a mistake that i will not make again. if i was just wanting to get loaded there are better and quicker ways.
2049,Natty Daddy (6%),2.38,people miss the point of a beer like natty daddy. it is one of my favorite beers because not only is it the cheapest beer on the market but it tastes better than the majority of adjunct lagers out there and has a very generous abv of 6%. it costs $9.77 for a case at my local store. that makes it extremely shareable as well. you cant beat the price+abv+taste combination. would i want to drink this beer every day? no. is this beer comparable to beers that were crafted for taste? no. this beer was crafted for affordability. it doesnt even taste bad. theres alot worse tasting lagers out there with half the abv and almost double the price. ill buy a case of natty daddy any day. thumbs up to anheuser-busch because this is the only adjunct lager i buy to this day.
2050,Natty Daddy (6%),1.02,quite disgusting. tastes like carbonated water with a slight beer taste. it\s hard for me to comment on any aromas and flavors because i could taste nothing but a very generic watered down beer flavor. there\s really nothing here.
2051,Natty Daddy (6%),2.72,poured from a 12 oz. can. has a very pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. smell is of corn mild grains green apples. taste is grains malts some corn is present hints of green apple mild and easy drinking. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall nothing special not bad for a cheap lager but nothing to get excited about.
2052,Triple (White),4.28,beautiful darker golden color with a fruity and slightly bitter flavor.
2053,Triple (White),3.79,enjoyed under the belfry of medieval gent before heading to bruges this foggy burnt gold beer has a very actively tall off-white foam head.  its airy froth belies a dry bite and a punch of peppery phenol before exhaling a little toasted biscuit where too some heat reveals itself.
2054,Triple (White),4.19,smooth and mellow completely belies its abv. two finger head laces down nicely. warm and smooth mouth feel awash with hops bready and malty finish. liquid biscuit aftertaste and you cant ask for more than that! excellent and rewarding triple ale.
2055,Triple (White),4.17,330 ml bottle into a chimay chalice poured at 50°. hazy gold fine white foam cap that laces down per sip. aroma of familiar belgian yeast biscuit banana distant hop. taste follows touch of warm spice. i enjoy the bitter finish. feel is medium medium to high carbonation. overall nice tripel.
2056,Triple (White),4.19,330ml. bottle in vientiane laos. pours a coppery red with a medium foamy head. aroma of dark fruits and bread. taste of malts yeast apple. moderate bitterness with a tart finish. a very pleasant tripel.
2057,Aaron,4.48,2016 bottling.
2058,Aaron,4.77,bottle generously shared by seth. dark brown pour with a kaki head. big booze and caramel malt aromas. big booze caramel malts and dark fruit highlights. wow this is fantastic. mild oak and vanilla sub tones. complex with a great body and mouthfeel. an incredible example of this style.....
2059,Aaron,4.75,dld - 5/18/2019
2060,Aaron,4.68,vintage 2016 bottled july 2018 drank march 2021  look - dark reddish brown. minimal to no head  smell - sweet with notes of toffee brown sugar & raisins  taste - toffee rasin tobacco a hint of chocolate and a finish of bourbon barrel. sweet and smooth with minimal alcohol burn. medium carbonation  feel - creamy and thick  overall - really impressed and this was a real treat. i have not had a lot of barleywines but certainly everything in the future will be compared to this.
2061,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.46,clear bright amber color with a respectable and lasting head. the aroma is toasted caramel malt and a hint of brown sugar. the taste is lightly sweet toasted caramel malt slightly metallic with a bit of herbal hops in the finish. the body is light/medium moderate carbonation smooth and fairly drinkable. altogether this is a modest attempt at an octoberfest solid and drinkable but nothing special.
2062,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.17,look: clear amber with a white head that dissipated quickly.  smell: pretty sweet up front with roasty and earthy notes blending in.  taste: follows smell pretty well. the aftertaste reminds me of a cheaper lager which i didnt love.  feel: medium body normal carbonation.  overall: solid drinkable but nothing to write home about.
2063,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,2.71,i had high hopes for this brew. but alas i am again disappointed. im a regular drinker of shiner bock. but thus far i have not been impressed with any of their other brews. this just continues that impression. the flavor was a bit muted and flat. not at all like a good oktoberfest. drinkable. but why? when there are so many really good fest beers to be had. why settle for a merely average beer?
2064,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.47,12oz bottle.  on a hard pour 3 fingers of dense off white head formed on top of a relatively hazy light amber body. head retention is quite nice.  aroma is quite clean with a toasty molassesy malt character. there is a slight fruity funk in the back that i dont quite love. has some cheap lager smell going on.  taste is better than the aroma and brings a more solid toasty malt flavor as well as some light earthy and herbal hops that provide some bitterness. this beer does come off as quits sweet and some of the fruitiness from the aroma sticks around but doesnt blend well with everything else.  feel is super drinkable but the sweet maltiness does make for a slightly syrupy finish. probably more enjoyable when drunk from the bottle.
2065,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.47,12 oz bottle into a becher glass. l: pours crystal clear rust amber with a 1 soapy light khaki head vg retention steady carbo bubbles minimal light scattered lacing. s: slightly metallic floral caramelized malts. t: lightly sweet caramelized malts a touch of honey a light hint of citrus zest very lightly metallic lightly bitter & dry in the finish. gently sweet overall. f: smooth lightly creamy med-light body with a gentle med-fast lightly drying finish. o: everything about this beer is light. it is well balanced with a pleasant aroma and is easy drinking with a smooth flow. it is good in its style.
2066,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.67,this is surprisingly sweet definitely not traditional. drinks well and tastes like a seasonal twist on a dark lager similar to but better than the sam adams version.
2067,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,3,look taste & smell was ok but the taste was too hoppy for the style. additionally the alcohol taste didn’t blend well upon the first & second swallow.
2068,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,3.48,clear amber brown body with a white head for the appearance. this one is a simpler marzen: macro sweet caramel malt in a halfhearted intensity toast and thats about it maybe a tiny hint of earthy hops on the very last iota of the finish. feels watered down yeast is not a factor malt dominates but is watery. but hey it looks nice in a mug!
2069,Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,2.49,crystal clear color looks alright but i have difficulty with this sort of color (color blind). head is anemic dissipating quickly and leaving no cap.  aroma is initially fruity lager esters (i.e. generic beer aroma). toasty bread crusty and caramel. the caramel starts to take over on subsequent nosing trending toward toffee though the crustiness is still present. mild herbal hop character is apparent in the background as well. not particularly deep or complex but not unpleasant though caramel and esters are not appropriate for the style.  on the palate the arrival is sweet malt with fruity esters running through out. the mid palate comes strongly into a pleasant bread crust flavor followed by good hop bitterness. the finish is dry and pleasant with a lingering mild bitterness. the caramel and toffee are in the palate as well but the crusty flavor is stronger. again not really appropriate for the style.  mouthfeel is a bit on the light side close but not quite creamy. moderately carbonated and a pleasantly dry finish.  just as a beer: its decent. i would drink this again (hence the overall of 3.5). as a märzen: its not a good representation of the style.
2070,Insert Hip Hop Reference There,4.64,this is a great tasting ipa. nice citra flavor nice mouth feel and definitely hoppy. its a triple so the hoppiness is to be expected. the mouth feel is very good but not the best i have had. definitely a world class beer! nice job!
2071,Insert Hip Hop Reference There,3.09,sweeter than a pastry stout
2072,Insert Hip Hop Reference There,4.9,yummy!
2073,Hoptimum,3.67,not the hop bomb i was expecting. has a annoying malty/sweetness to it that i don’t care for. i was hunting this down for a while and i was let down.
2074,Hoptimum,4.15,for anyone looking for the stronger styles this one fits the bill. making stronger ale needs more hops to balance out the vast quantities of malt and they succeed making that name appropriate.
2075,Hoptimum,4.41,look - deep gold solid white head little lacing smell - dank ripe fruit piney citrus taste - sweet fruit piney hoppy resinous feel - medium body moderate carbonation highly resinous sticky finish overall - this is one hoppy mutha. a tale of two halves to this gem. shes a bit boozy at first and the juicy fruitiness is more present on the scent and taste. its like a hoppy juicy candy-esque treat. as it breathes and warms it shifts to the piney hoppy resinous flavor with some citrus to balance it out. if youre looking for your hop fix this is it. let it warm sip and enjoy. ratchet up blue oyster cult and zero in on godzilla for this monster.
2076,Hoptimum,3.35,2023 version.  pretty average. not impressed with this one. a vaguely annoying sweetness is going on here and its just overall not that interesting of a brew.  a perfectly drinkable beer. nice and crisp but i cant find anything i really love about it. not much complexity. i can think of many other ipas id rather be drinking.  somewhat heavy abv at 11%. one bottle will have you feeling a buzz so dont have too many of these...
2077,Hoptimum,4.57,look: poured into snifter. burnt orange in color with a fluffy beige-colored head.  smell: strong notes of citrus fruits - orange in particular. strong hoppy aromas as well. very dank but also has a sweetness to it as well that makes for a really pleasant smell.  taste: powerful hoppy front nice bitterness that you’d expect and it really bites down on you. citrus fruits follow - i’m getting the orange from the nose plus lemon malts some barley and then there’s a really nice bitterness after the baseline taste finishes. all in all it has a very imperial taste to it and it’s superb.  feel: heavy on this one - it’s 11% abv and tastes / feels imperial. the carbonation is medium but it sits heavy. take your time with this one and sip it steadily.  overall: wonderful offering that i’d buy again.
2078,Hoptimum,4.3,ipa pushed to extreme end taste is massive tropical and floral
2079,Hoptimum,3.79,12 ounce bottle dated 4-13-23 poured fridge cold into a wasatch brewing can-glass. generous foam rises above an orange tinted bronze brew. a little sticky lace manages its way throughout the drink. aroma is disappointing. it’s not as mighty as it should be for a huge tipa. taste is a tad confusing; it’s not this big hoppy dank bomb i was expecting / hoping for. the sweetness is annoying. there’s a hint of bitterness trying to surface but the sweet kicks it back down. mouth is nicely dense mid carbonation. overall points for reaching sw florida at just 5 weeks since bottling. but damn. this should be so much more in every department - except the buzz. a pair of these gets the cheeks red. that may be its saving grace..
2080,Hoptimum,2.05,ehhh... dont bother with this one.
2081,Hoptimum,4.02,12oz bottled 4-6-22. opened 2-12-23. 1+ finger white head with very good retention leaves behind some thin wisps of lacing early. orange-gold body with great clarity. big nose of candied orange late mint and sweet malt. sweet fruit - fruit salad with berries tropical and some ripe citrus. full body creamy mouthfeel - no real heat but the 11% is apparent. long finish with some lingering sweetness. very good.
2082,Pure Hoppiness,3.93,canned 5/11/21.
2083,Pure Hoppiness,4.25,i get a lot of herby hops and just a little bready sweetness.  bitterness and an herbal dankness dominate an extremely clean taste that only has a slight hint of malt.  its really thin and has medium carbonation.  the finishish is dry bitter and quick... like john olivers wit.  overall its a delightful clean and interesting ipa that i give a 5.1 out of 6.
2084,Pure Hoppiness,4.33,poured out a clear golden amber with a barely sustainable head. fresh citrus with orange peel some dank hop notes. pucker upon first sip resin and a biting hop flavor. lemon and grapefruit rind. nice bitterness and okay carbonation. great hop experience with this one.
2085,Pure Hoppiness,4.21,this is a big classic west coast double ipa and it’s one of the best specimens of that species. juicy piney and full bodied while achieving a dry finish.  smells of huge hops but not one fruity flavor stands out. usually doubles don’t have as much hop scent due to all the maltiness but this thing is “mega” hopped—dry hopped big time i bet. i get sweet malty orange spicy hops. wow.  on the tongue piney orange zest hops and cracker bread and toasted malts. finishes fairly dry despite the thick wet feel it hits you with.  it’s big it’s flavorful and it’s pretty amazing.  i loved this review by a real pro and amend mine with it:  by: tracy hensley ljudges rating:  overall impression: 18 / 20  a consistent aroma blend of clean pine resin pineapple syrup freshly ripped mint and cracked black pepper lead the way in the front of the nose. from 8 inches away tahitian vanilla bean pods baked whole wheat bread low sulfur notes and white grape-like fruitiness also appear. the white head does not persist but does create a fine foam above a slightly hazy golden appearance. flavors start as intense dank pine extract and continues into the aftertaste where it is accompanied by sweetened white bread which keeps the bitterness in check with a moderate throat-coating alcoholic warmth. the second sip showcases tropical mango juice before pine again dominates as noticeable alcohol warmth and low motor oil elements come through. full body and full fat creaminess coats the mouth and the medium-high carbonation and moderate hop mouthfeel close out the finish while alcohol tingles on the lips.“
2086,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1.85,you’re drinking this to get drunk; not to enjoy a quality beer.  it tastes like slightly malty water. goes down nice and smooth. no real complaints here but you’d be hard pressed to find any real endorsements either.  make no mistake: this is a shit beer you buy for the alcohol content and nothing more. however as shit beers bought solely for their alcohol content go; this one goes hard. my number 1 recommendation for broke college students.
2087,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1,the only people i ever see buying this obviously want to save .25c per can. it is not worth the savings because this beer is horrid. just spend more and drink something good. if i could give this less than 1 i would
2088,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.53,l: transparent light yellow some bubbles minimal head s: sweet slightly skunky adjunct lager smell some fruity apple notes t: slightly sweet a bit dry and bitter. not too flavorful but also not too bland. a bit balanced towards the toasted malts with a slight skunky hop note.. the alcohol is a bit detectable. f: medium carbonation and light bodied. a bit drying. o: drinkable but not very enjoyable. will have to see how this compares to their lager offering for determining the best cheapest beer.
2089,Laker Ice Premium Lager,3.25,pours gold coloured and crystal clear not no head to speak of. the smell is all biscuit. the taste is also all biscuit. this is a bare bones basic beer and is priced accordingly dec 14 2020
2090,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1.71,poured from a 473ml can.  decent appearance with full white head but taste is sweet adjuncts and very off putting. tastes fake and manufactured not sure how someone can go through a whole can of this.
2091,Laker Ice Premium Lager,3.25,good cheap beer for canada.  this one of the last independent brewers. please support the little guy!! without them we only lower the competition and our selection ultimately.  a- golden goodness- beer!  s- beerie goodness  t- typical north american beer flavor  m- same as above!  o- good cheap beer  thx for reading
2092,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2,a - pours a pale golden colour no head and no lacing.  s - sweet corn grains apple juice and a bit of honey on the finish.  t - same as the nose sweet corn grainy malts lots of apple juice with a hint of sour cider and corn syrop on the finish.  m - thin and watery with a wet finish.  o - theres a reason this is $1.85 a tall can. nothing special here not worthy and a waste of a twoonie.
2093,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.9,does the job... honestly this is a mass produced lager it honestly isnt that bed it isnt that great it is a go to beer when you want something that honestly doesnt make you think more then you just want another beer... apparently i need to say more and more and more and more i have nothing more to say so i am blah blah blahing right now is this enough word to describe a run of the mill ice lager??!
2094,Coffee Bender,3.92,tastes as close to cold steeped coffee as i’ve had in a beer.
2095,Coffee Bender,4.18,the beer is a very dark brown with some garnet peeking through. medium-sized tan head. a little lace. coffee aroma some roasted malt. strong coffee taste espresso. coffee taste lingers. a little bit of chocolate some late hoppiness. medium-bodied. i liked how the coffee stayed present.
2096,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,3.86,pours appropriately hazy golden amber beer. good head retention for a na! big hoppy nose offering tropical fruity notes right on style. pretty darn good taste as well: maybe just a touch of graininess i wouldnt expect in a normal beer but otherwise its square on a ne ipa style. good body with lots of carbonation. nas have really improved the last few years. last time i was drinking them regularly was about a decade ago and the choices of good ones were slim. now theres a wealth of choices.
2097,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,4.5,a delicious beer for a summer afternoon. a little bite notes of citrus good mouthfeel. as any decent hazy ipa it walks that line between bitter hops and citrus tart. it seems a little more carbonated than most beers too which adds to the experience of drinking it. a very worthy contender in the na scene.
2098,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,4.25,can. white head with lace. hazy orange gold color.  this is one of the better nas out there. this tastes like a real hazy ipa. juicy and tropical. lots of melon peach and mango. some orange and pineapple too. hoppy light bitterness. super drinkable.
2099,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,3,non-alcoholic beer is an oxymoron but i was curious and this is my first foray into the genre. it looks like beer with its hazy body & modest white head. it does have a slight hoppy aroma. there is some hop flavor but that’s it. no wheat no malt no complexity. feels like a soda. overall: it’s just hop flavored soda water.
2100,Samuel Adams Just The Haze,3.95,seems a little too carbonated thats all. overall they did a pretty good job i would drink it again. just nice to have an ipa especially a hazy one. i dont drink alcohol anymore so this is a real treat to know these beers are out there now
2101,Cobra,2.84,bottle at punjab london england  a: the beer is clear yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation. it poured with a half finger high white head that has good retention properties. s: light aromas of sweet and pilsener malts are present in the nose along with hints of floral hops. t: the taste has flavors of pilsener and sweet malts. there is a slight amount of bitterness. o: it feels medium-bodied a bit smooth and very clean on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. o: i liked the clean and malty mouthfeel of this beer.  serving type: bottle
2102,Cobra,2.46,not terrible for a cheap beer to compliment some cheap indian food. id take this over a heineken or a corona.
2103,Cobra,1.99,de color ámbar cabeza espumosa media con cuerpo ligero y una carbonatación media/alta. aroma ligero a malta y granos. en boca es ligera dulce con un dejo de malta y un poco de pan.
2104,Cobra,2.51,light orange colour no carbonation no foam. weak sweet malt smell. taste is sweet and watery and strangely reminiscent of apple juice. refreshing yet liveless and watery. if given the choice between this beer and kingfisher please take the latter. please do.
2105,Congress Street IPA,3.06,canned on 7/19/23  a: pours with a near opaque cloudiness. a dense white head rises with good retention and lace. manageable to pour if you go slow. s: some sweet fruits most people are saying pineapple. sure i guess i can go with that. i dont know if these kinds of neipas overwhelm me to a point were i just cant pick anything out cause i dont get near the expressive fruity/hops aromas as others. its just vaguely there. t: yep sweet and fruity. like store bought dole juice to me. i dont get anything in the finish but some hop burn...or alcohol cant figure it out... m/o: i guess i cant be too hard but just muddled to me. low carbonation sticky sweet no finish some kind of astringency. either from hop burn or alcohol burn. this is going to be a chore to finish.  every once in a while i like to revisit styles i\m not the biggest fan of especially when a hyped brewery pops up in my area. to see if or how my tastes change. well this is a style i have yet to really enjoy. some will say don\t review styles you don\t like but i\m just trying to see what everyone but me seems to like...oh well.
2106,Congress Street IPA,4.34,poured with a soft thick head comprised of tiny bubbles like steamed milk for a latte. nose is all galaxy - pineapple peach citrus and rind as well as hints of melon. trillium seems to have a knack for highlighting melon notes from several different hops and melon is in the foreground in the taste which is fruity but not sweet with a nice gentle bitterness on the finish.
2107,Congress Street IPA,4.44,pours like a mix of lemon and orange juice nicely hazy with a soft pillowy head. honestly the nose didnt match the beer a little yeasty and muddy. lots of citrus notes but not overly sweet so it had a nice balance. an exemplary hazy ipa one that is equally drinkable and cherishable.
2108,Congress Street IPA,4.83,this is a type of hazy ipa i wish i had more access to. not too muddied and plenty of citrus moving forward. sharp finish for a hazy. just the right amount of malt. a very clear tasting hazy if that makes sense. well done and i can see why this brewery is rated so high.
2109,Upper Case,4.9,#176 yummy!
2110,Upper Case,4.44,my first trillium a surprise keg at the kinderhill brewery! got the last pour!  thick rich hazy yellow with a creamy beige head and great curtain lacing. strong distinctive tropical fruit smell and taste. pineapple mangoorange grapefruit. some basil herbal flavor. nice hoppiness fresh with a bit of burn. silky smooth feel. really nice beer!
2111,Upper Case,4.72,very smooth @ 9%.
2112,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,3.42,this beer is exactly what it purports to be: spicy and pumpkin  color: lovely golden orange with a thick white head  smell: almost all roasted (not raw) pumpkin very little spices a tad of jalapeño. no breads or baked goods on the nose.  taste: mild pumpkin again roasted in flavor. some cinnamon no allspice cardamom ginger or nutmeg but a touch of vanilla? lots of heat jalapeño and something a touch stronger. its kind of exactly as it says it is.  please note this beer shouldnt be drunk ice cold it needs to be cool but not cold or you will get very little flavor.
2113,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,5,pours a lovely orange color has the aroma of freshly baked pumpkin pie whipped cream and all tastes like a spicy pumpkin pie. the spicy gimmick is a lot of fun to drink it might just be best to enjoy a 6pk of instead of a 12pk with all of that spice. i really enjoyed it!  style: fruit beer | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 6.4% | rating: 5
2114,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,3.64,starting the pumpkin season a little early but its my fantasy football draft night. this is new belgiums atomic pumpkin spicy release. it looks innocent with its transparent amber color and white head and the nose is complicit with its graham cracker aroma. there isnt much pumpkin flavor but the chilies dominate the flavor and mouthfeel. your tongue will tingle but its not overpowering or off-putting like other spicy beers ive tried. theres a sentence i never expected to write. i feel like this is more of a gimmicky beer but one worth a try.
2115,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,1.24,honestly it’s undrinkable
2116,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,3.25,bottle from boise coop. pretty standard fare here normal amount of pumpkin spice. bright dark golden with a small soapy head. taste is more of the pumpkin spice kind of generic but it is that time of year.
2117,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,2.2,i wish i\d noticed the spicy part on the label. what a horrible surprise.
2118,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,3.81,clear amber body with a small off white head and light lacing. aroma is more focused on the pumpkin rather than the pumpkin spices although they are evident especially cinnamon. nor did the aroma foretell the impact of the peppers on the tastebuds. theyre there from first sip to the finish and add a different dimension to the style.
2119,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,3.87,12oz can. canning date stamped on can bottom is 220721 with best by date of 23 jul 2023. clear orange amber colored body. brief off white head reduces to thin ring. no lacing left behind. aroma of sweet pumpkin spice (nutmeg cloves and allspice) along with a lightly toasted malt base. way in the background is some chile pepper. taste does express the pumpkin (slightly sweet) together with a moderate amount of pumpkin spice including cinnamon. the chiles arrive first on the tongue and then go to the back of the throat. lingering slight burn in the throat. thinner than medium mouth feel. okay carbonation. the chiles and cinnamon team up to create a spicy experience but not a burning one.
2120,Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,4.02,12 oz can with best before dating of 20aug2022 stamped on the bottom.  lightly hazed dull copper and leaves a shite ton of fine bubble splattered sheeting all over the glass.  on the sniff i pick up notes of blistered chili pepper.  tasty chili infused brew with the chili presence ratcheted up pretty high....a bit more then a moderate chili burn upon each sip....i wish all fall themed pumpkin beers took this approach being a rather large chili head...well worth a try
2121,Michelob Ultra,5,it’s so smooth. very easy drinking. enjoy it at a bbq or a hot summer day after yard work. it quenches your thirst and you can have a bunch of them. very crushable. i recommend it. cheers!
2122,Michelob Ultra,2.1,7/12/23 drank straight from a 12 oz bottle so much of my style points come from the nice bottle ;)  purchased a six pack of 12 oz bottles for my cousin shauns upcoming visit! this is his fav.  first note i am suprised to get a buzz for what my taste buds are saying is lightly (and i mean lightly) flavored beer sparkling water. what an odd sensation. today was a very hot humid day of work and i must say that this hit the spot for a cool off after work. would i enjoy this for an enjoyable taste session? absolutely not. however at a hot picnic get together and this was the only offering its better than nothing.
2123,Michelob Ultra,3.25,not to bad.
2124,Michelob Ultra,2.55,its alright.
2125,Michelob Ultra,2.5,a- skanky corn yellow straw  s- bruised malt a german train car cigarettes  t - creamed corn some mild bitterness aluminum  m- surprisingly good  o- junk and i am usually way above average for aal ratings. if you want a light beer done right look at the hofbrau session or a miller. this one sucks
2126,Michelob Ultra,1.7,this is some abysmal stuff no sense of beer detected. really doesnt even taste like beer-flavored water. for just 1% of additional abv a person could enjoy a truly delicious high life. this product makes no sense to me. unless youre drinking a hundred beers a day the calorie difference is negligible from an actually full-flavored aal.
2127,Michelob Ultra,1.8,like water very little smell and taste extremely light.
2128,Michelob Ultra,3.45,i had one today for free at the finish line of a 25 kilometer race that i ran. everyone around me has a perrin grapefruit ipa but i was satisfied with my choice in this context.  cant really rate look or feel drinking from an aluminum bottle.
2129,Michelob Ultra,3.59,easily one of my favorite light beers and one of anhauser-busch’s best products. this product is truly refreshing and does its wonders during a hot summer day when you need something to cool you down. it’s extremely light so you could easily crush a couple of these guys with no problem. this product offers a unique after taste that many light american beers lack. not the beer of choice if you want to expirence intoxication which is why this losses some points however the first sip will immediately brighten your mode
2130,Michelob Ultra,3.64,it was an ok beer. it was the first beer i ever tried. very bland compared to most in my opinion. it was free so that was why i tried it. i had never really considered it before receiving it as a christmas gift. it’s not something i can see myself buying. if it’s free though i’ll take it.
2131,Michelob Ultra,2.22,presentation: 12 ounce cans poured into a pint glass  looks like a pale yellow color. minimal head.  smells smells slightly of roasted malt. bit of a grainy odor . very faint odor.  tastes like a generic light beer. nothing remarkable about it. faint flavor of hops and malt. heavy seltzer taste.  feels feels like seltzer water in the mouth.  overall it’s a run of the mill light beer. really nothing special about it. it has fewer calories than other light beer so this might appeal to some. easy to drink but not very flavorful.
2132,Celebrator,4.94,my first doppelbock. when i read what a doppelbock was i knew i would love it. this beer is soo good! malt malt malt! extraordinary! will be in my permanent rotation!
2133,Celebrator,4.44,excellent doppelbock. dark color dark translucent light barely shines through at all still clear. feel is ok but it tastes great. easy toasty but not smokey. smell is nice but too subtle.
2134,Celebrator,5,one of the finest beers on the market. the look is similar to a brown ale. lots of malt  chocolate and toffee on the nose. the nose definitely transfers to the palate. its not overly heavy. a very nice balance of dark and rich maltiness. the 6.7 abv gives it enough punch to compliment the flavor profile. o e of my most recommended beers.
2135,Celebrator,3.27,very deep amber nearly black. malty spicy smell. taste is the same very fizzy in mouth. not bad but not that interesting
2136,Celebrator,4.1,330 ml bottle poured cold into a pint glass. deep brown with a good dense tan foam. aroma is bready malt - reminds me of spent brewery malt really. and yes.. pumpernickel.. taste follows tasty malt forward with coffee in the middle. the coffee lingers. finishes lightly sweet slightly dry. overall i think i got a reasonably fresh bottle to grade. i’ve had many that were tinny. this is a fine beer..
2137,Celebrator,4.93,11.2 oz bottle stamped l2224 into a 12 oz tulip glass. l: pours black with a 2+ rounded light tan creamy head that has excellent retention with a light cap good steady fine carbo bubbles spotty random lacing and some light sheeting. s: highly caramelized malts toasted grains dark chocolate a hint of minerality background dark fruits. t: moderately complex masterfully balanced chocolate caramelized malts dark fruit notes of fig dates plum red grape char darkly roasted grains raisins dark brown bread crust and a tender mineral taste. it is very gently bitter. f: creamy medium-heavy body with a medium-length fairly smooth standard finish. o: one of the most agreeable beers ive ever tasted. gorgeous fantastic balance encapsulated in chocolate lightly sweet bitter toasty malts smooth finish. incredibly pleasing tastes. rated #1 because it deserves it. one of the finest beers in the world. it is world-class.
2138,Celebrator,2.94,had high expectations but it was just okay.
2139,Celebrator,3.97,330 ml bottle poured into a tulip.  clear and saddle brown with ruby hues and a two finger manila colored head. the foam is persistent fairly dense and leaves a little lace. a lively glass of beer.  the nose is malty with bread caramel and dried fruit aromas over lesser milky lactose and mineral notes. less malty and sweet than expected the taste is overall sharp with a woody hop finish. there is caramel and chocolate malt flavor but bread isnt coming through. carbonation is medium-high but the medium-weight body is soft and creamy.  fist time trying this and as stated it is more sharp and less malt forward than i expected. my bottle is just over a year old and i am curious if a fresher bottle is that much different.
2140,Batch 10000,3.98,good use of mango with a dry beer like this. would like to try a non-imperial version.
2141,Batch 10000,3.57,looking forward to high gravity full fruit bitterness. short\s brewing has 10.000 reasons for doing so. with that many batches under their belt they are looking to dominate the double brut india pale ale with mango and blackcurrant market.  in commemoration of the event batch 10000 pours with a hazy golden orange slightly rusty slightly tarnish. as a cottony creme builds on the rim its fruity and spicy scents culminate in a citrusy spirits tingle of the nose. with an herbal nature lurking in the background. the first sip leans into a fruity cocktail sweetness with a bready poundcake maltiness.  as the racy carbonation rushes in to dry the ale the fruitiness of mango and blackcurrant work to keep the session juicy plump and sweet. as the bubble and alcohol spice win out on the middle palate its true spice resonates in a spicy bitterness that pangs away at the throat again in a citrus accented liquor kind of way.  medium full and finishing remarkably dry for its strength the fruity brut ipa closes with a hot and prickly bitterness that proves a little too distracting in the end- much like having a standard imperial ipa but with a shot of curacao liquor. chased by a piney sense of botanical gin and the beer wants to be a refreshing and more drinkable session but its syrupy dryness suggests otherwise.
2142,Batch 10000,3.18,appearance - the beer poured a murky orange color with visible carbonation and a white head.  smell - there was little fruit or sweetness in the nose. it almost had a minty pine nose.  taste - the can promised notes of mango and black currant. i felt like i was drinking menthol cigarettes with notes of pine and cranberries. it was a kool ipa. per the style the finish was dry. oddly enough i really did not want another puff.  mouthfeel - the carbonation was aggressive drying the palate quickly.  overall - i can believe reviewers have liked this beer. did i get a bad can?
2143,Batch 10000,4.53,shorts super hoppy holidays 2020 18 pack 12 oz. can dated 10/20/20 poured into spiegelau ipa glass  look - off white head cloudy copper color. smell - strong notes of mango and black currant not much booze. taste - booze overpowers the fruit very astringent. feel - you get the alcohol bite on the back of the tongue and in the throat but surprisingly not very drying. overall - a good fruity booze bomb well worth trying.
2144,Batch 10000,3.48,i had this from a bottle. it’s a strong one! watch out. pours a ruddy golf amber. tastes tartly sour. the black currants are prominent on the palate and likewise on the nose. uneven and bitter.
2145,Batch 10000,4.24,bought a bottle and saved it for a special occasion. opened it on the last day of summer vacation. at 14% i hope im not hungover when i teach tomorrow. it doesnt drink as heavy as other high abv. notably unique. a standout like no other. crisp and effervescent like a double brut should be. juicy like a nebraska ipa. the hops are smooth and full. the mango and black currant blend together to form a new fruit flavor. the complexity is brilliant. #michigancraft
2146,Batch 10000,4.04,12 fl. oz bottle served in an ipa glass  this beer pours a deep copper color with burnt orange highlights. it is hazy and topped with an inch of tan head that leaves spotty lacing.  the aroma is fruity. i can pick out the mango and black current there is a solid toast/biscuit aroma as well.  the taste is citrus with the mango and black current. there is a slightly tart aspect to this beer. there is plenty of malt to try and balance the flavor.  full bodied with a thick smooth mouthfeel  this is pretty tasty and fruity for a big bodied monster ipa.
2147,Batch 10000,4.29,thank you blackop555 for this 12 oz bottle poured into a teku  a- a clear reddish purple with a two off white head.  s- black currents some alcohol some mango earthy/piney hops.  t- black currents some mango piney touch of alcohol.  m- smooth light to medium body dry.  o- honestly thought this was only around 10% abv but was pleasantly surprised when i found out it is over 14% love the currents in this.
2148,Batch 10000,4.23,wow never really had a beer quite like this. beautiful golden orange liqueur appearance big tropical mango aromas black currant acid cuts through the sweetness nicely lingering piney hop bitterness. boozy but doesn’t taste 14.20% no lingering warming. really unique beer incredibly priced at $2.89 for a 12oz bottle.
2149,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.83,great example of a michelada
2150,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.8,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours a murky tomato juice color with almost no head of foam. smell – as would be expected the nose is heavy of a tomato juice and clamato smell. mixed with these aromas is a light graininess and a touch of mustiness. taste – the taste starts out with a quite sweet and salty clamato taste with a little bit of light breadiness. this pretty much sums up the majority of the taste throughout. not good! mouthfeel – with the clamato the brew is slightly thicker and chewier with a lower carbonation. overall – nope. not going back to this one. i sometimes like clamato in a light lager but this is over the top in clamato. way too much and way to sweet and salty. it’s a no go.
2151,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.6,12 ounce can julian date 22056 (feb 25 2022) stamped on the bottom of the can not sure if thats the canned on or best by date. served in a pint glass the beer pours a hazy reddish/pinkish color with about an inch pink cola-like head that fizzled away pretty quick. not much if any lacing at all. the brew smells like tomato juice clamato salt and a bit of lime. taste is similar to the aroma but theres some mineral and peppery flavors noticeable too. mouthfeel/body is medium its a bit coating smooth and enjoyable to drink. truthfully the longer i drink it the more i like it. i dont know if its because of the clamato but this is a big improvement over the modelo chelada i had earlier today. id definitely buy this one again.
2152,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.41,24oz can shared amongst friends review from notes  i cant understand why some like these so much... i guess im not big on clamato either but this is just non-potable... spoiled clamato and rotgut vodka are the dominating flavors
2153,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,4.29,i get that bud light michelada isnt for everybody because its for people who enjoy micheladas. theres a reason why their line of micheladas keep growing to a half dozen or more. these bad reviews are obviously from people who dislike micheladas which i find both humorous and absurd. would you drink a sour or stout and think its great if you hate those styles of beer lmao. cmon beer snobs. use some common sense.
2154,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.06,picked up from a drive-thru liquor store as a tall boy for $2.99. poured into a tulip glass.  l - thick near-syrupy bright scarlet with a sort of opaqueness to it. 1mm pale rust head that disappears nearly instantly. s - v8 clams and gasoline. mineral almost like salt. slight rice backing. t - heavy ethanol and lime notes lead way to even heavier clam and v8 flavors. though barely noticeable rice and wheat are present. black pepper finish. f - viscous and barely carbonated. o - before i could make out any flavor the first thing that came to my head was what the fuck did i just drink? for the sake of being 100% fair with everything i drink (and in recognition that this is likely an acquired taste) i drank the whole thing - about two and a half glass pours. first off it\s bad. getting that out of the way it\s not as bad as you\d first think! it tastes like clamato and lime. like a really terrible bloody mary. i should note that bloody mary cocktails aren\t really my thing but i get the appeal. this beer would definitely be better if it had some heat to it and a lot more black pepper. maybe some celery. i won\t buy this again but it\s worth giving it a try.
2155,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.82,a lot of people are not judging this michelada fairly. this is a great michelada that is a higher abv than most other micheladas on the market. the clamato adds a great flavor profile that is very refreshing and delicious. my only complaint is that it could use some more lime flavor i sometimes add a slice of lime to this and it makes it even better.
2156,Citra,4.6,the first citra was incredible. we found that bottle aging for ten days smoothed it out. after a few years of substandard citra hops resulting in a brew not as good as the first its back up to where it was in the beginning. since krbc switched to all aluminum cans the mouth feel is less wonderful than from a bottle. its best at the brewery. the food? i go to drink not to eat. the waffle fries are flavored soggy cardboard.
2157,Citra,4.04,great flavored ipa full of hoppy flavor in every sip great hop after taste great beer to drink again
2158,Citra,4.46,citra from kern river brewing 16 fl oz can from @2beerdogs in nbw bif 17. reviewed 25/04/23 (review 3082). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. lower rim of can stamped “canned on 0?/2?/23”. stored at 34 degrees at home. served at 45.3 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 54.5 degrees f. appearance – 4.25. first pour – pale straw (srm 2) clear. body – pale gold (srm 4) hazy. under direct light same. when rear lite translucent. head: large (maximum 4.5 cm aggressive center pour) ivory high density average retention rapidly retreating leaving a 1.2 – 2.2 cm jagged crown and a rocky complete layer. as the head contracts irregular elongated islands remain above the head. lacing – good – remnants of the head following the patterns of the head but thinner. aroma – 4.5 – grapefruit and generic citrus (tending toward pineapple) backed by caramel malt no yeast. no ethanol (8.5 % abv as marked on the label) aroma. flavor – 4.5 – follows the nose. begins and ends citrusy and full-bodied a bit dank and resinous over caramel malt. no yeast or ethanol. barely noticeable gastric warming. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. ends crisp and dry with a little resin. palate – 4.25 – full; dry; lively carbonation. final impression and summation: 4.5 good dipa – dank crisp and citrusy.
2159,Citra,4.58,the smell is just unreal and this one is not for a first time ipa drinker. what a treat and i hope they continue to expand with their distribution. very lucky to get a hold of this legendary beer. so many powerful tasting notes and the sweetness at the end is done just right.
2160,Citra,4.72,pours golden yellow with thin white foamy cap in small tulip glass on draught at father’s office. beautiful citrus pineapple mango and hops on the nose. really great springy dipa bursting with citra hops! cheers to greatness!
2161,Citra,4.51,citra pours a slightly hazy cloudy amber color with a big beautiful head. a sixteen ounce canned 11/24/22 is very strong with the citra aroma. taste is powerful and good. citra and amarillo go together well in this brew. fabulously smooth and not really bitter at all. overall a fine double ipa.
2162,Citra,4.35,both @2beerdogs and @beersnake1 sent me cans of this one related to the recent nbs bif#16 so i guess the california contingent feels strongly that i should try it!!  beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam. soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles it sticks to the glass as it recedes.  nose is a great showcase for citra hops and that works for me because citra is a great hop! theres some citrus some pine some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath.  flavour isnt quite as rich as the aroma but it presents all the goodies. bitter citrus and pine some caramel malts some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. its mostly in the pith/citrus side of things but not the full on acid bomb of like a monkish and its balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance.  this is just a phenomenal beer all around and right up my alley. i love what ive tried from kern river and i can see why both tim and derek both independently thought i should try this beer. thanks fellas!!
2163,Citra,4.35,poured from a can at fridge temp. pours an opaque yellow with fluffy white head. the nose is tropical fruit pine needles marmalade. the taste is incredible. tropical fruit orange peel pine honey marmalade apricot pineapple and a bit of leather. mouthfeel is light and dry. overall a wonderful ipa.
2164,Citra,4.35,16 ounce can into plastic hotel room cup at tustin inn. canned on 3/17/22. pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. dense soapy lacing clings down the glass with some streaming carbonation. aromas and flavors of huge passion fruit papaya mango melon guava blueberry tangerine red grapefruit citrus peel/rind wood mint peppercorn pine cracker bread dough light honey/toast herbal floral grass and yeast earthiness. good sized pine citrus peel/rind herbal woody grassy spicy bitterness on the finish. medium carbonation and medium-full body. balanced creamy/grainy malts and sticky/resinous hops in the mouthfeel. long resinous drying finish with mild astringency. mild increasing warmth of 8.5% a bit of hop burn. super juicy dank and earthy hops; with a good sized malt backbone. top tier west coast style aggressive yet smooth.
2165,Citra,4.94,poured a golden amber color with a nice 1 inch head that left some lacing. taste is exactly what i hoped for—loads of delicious dank citra! mouthfeel is nice; has some rich gravity to it. i’m highly considering buying some more of this—very nice delicious brew. very strong on the citra hops and leans on the west coast ipa side thankfully.
2166,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.7,i did everything possible not to like it.  after serving it i could still smell it from two meters away.   i tried it and although it does not reach the westy xii the only thing i can say while i continue to dislike it is that it is simply epic well deserved fame.
2167,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.3,poured into a gulden draak tulip. pours a lightly hazy medium to dark brownish orange with a fizzy one finger khaki head that dissipates to patches with light lacing; a bit of particulates at the bottom of the glass despite a calm pour..aroma of dry caramel malt figs raisins dates and and some toffee. flavor follows with deep caramel malt dried dark fruit particularly dates and raisins brown bread and cloves. finishes a bit minierally but with residual dark fruit. medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. has a much brighter flavor profile than any dubbel ive had before almost a belgian dark ale flavor. this is undoubtedly due to this having a bit of age to it with a best buy date of 2019 so likely about 8 years old. probably my only chance to try this so i grabbed a bottle. despite the assumed lighter characater for aging has a deep malt and great fruit notes. a slight sharpness (mineral) in the finish but the residual fruit flavors make up for it. this makes me really want to try a fresher bottle but im still impressed with the malty flavor depth of the 8; not quite a deep and malty as 12 but fine. a rare treat ive wanted to try something from this brewery since i started my interest in craft beers and glad to try the dubbel and quad.
2168,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.53,poured more beige foam than walnut colored beer into the glass so i guess the unknown age of the beer isn’t too old. the aroma was pretty mild for me due to covid messing with my sense of smell but i did get some dark fruit and chocolate and spice. had to be potent for me to get any of that! the flavor was really really good. dark fruit and dark chocolate and a menagerie of spices that were all wrapped up in what seemed like champagne flavors and texture. the feel was excellent the massive head didn’t dissipate the carbonation that i could tell and somehow that is what made it all work together. maybe the bite of the bubbles kept it from getting too sweet? not sure. but darned good dubbel!
2169,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.25,from 10/16/21
2170,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.28,2011 vintage  well it may be a bit older than is ideal but i’m very excited to try westy 8 the highest rated dubbel on ba! after having the 12 for the first time just a few weeks ago and loving it i knew i had to seek out some of this too. i managed to end up with 1 bottle each of 2010 and 2011 so i figured i’d drink the slightly newer one first. let’s see what it’s all about  pours an opaque medium brown with just a ring of light tan bubbles that leaves no lacing  there’s a surprising boozy bite in the nose here given it’s only 8%. i’m picking up on aromas of dark bread burnt caramel sweet bourbon raisin brown sugar honey pear skin and light clove  even 11 years out this has a great presence in taste. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting black cherry dark bread candi sugar pear skin light floral hops overripe banana and plum. the swallow brings notes of dark toast raisin red grape sweet caramel toffee sticky molasses and light honey  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth and silky beer. finishes mostly dry with a nice fruity sweetness  it’s certainly not the ideal to have this so old so i have to bump it a bit in the overall. i can see what used to be there when it was fresh and i hope one day to be able to try it fresh. either way it’s an awesome beer
2171,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.5,brown-red foamy long lasting. dark fruits cherry raisins.  typical belgian yeast. also sherry/port wine tastes. creamy/smooth some acidity. some spices. some bitterness in the finish.  overall: many similarities to westy 12 but a bit more toned down less sweet.
2172,Hatch Chile Gatos,4,crystal clear and no head. ever chop a chili and get that heat smell well thats the smell i get here. dont expect anything other than chili sensations in this. there is also a sting on the tongue but not bad at all. nicely carbonated with a long finish. didnt know what to expect and i liked it.
2173,Hatch Chile Gatos,5,you can smell feel and taste the hatch! at mcfate scottsdale az
2174,Hatch Chile Gatos,3.92,on-tap at the brewery a hatch chile infused blonde ale. on to the beer:  light pale yellow colored with a little head and spotty lace. the aroma is full of hatch chiles spicy and crisp with a note of cereal. in terms of flavor it surely has a kick but it doesnt kick you down. gentle spiciness of hatch chiles ensures of a smooth and intriguing ride. perhaps its biggest surprise was how quaffable the beer was.
2175,Hatch Chile Gatos,3.96,great chile flavor. a little heat.
2176,Hatch Chile Gatos,3.79,very nice balanced and drinkable chile beer the heat not overpowering. on tap at the source.fuller mouthfeel. mild aroma. az is a good chile beer town.
2177,Hatch Chile Gatos,5,like liquid hatch chile cornbread. the base cream ale is fantastic and this one amps it up with a good dose of smoky hatch chiles. not for everyone but definitely for me!  (update: up to now ive had one 5.0 rated beer. it was firestone walkers 805. i feel like 5.0 beers are ones that trascend rating really and move into something deeply personal. i would never expect anyone to rate 805 or this beer a 5.0 but well for me they are. they transcend something. they are satisfying in a way almost no beer is to me. the description above is still right on -- lovely hints of corn smoky hatch chiles that pop up with exquisite flavor but only light heat in the finish. i would drink this by the bucket if they let me. i dunno. i just love it. and im giving it a 5.)
2178,Blessed,4.63,2021 editiion drank may 2022. so sweet even the small bottle was a lot to drink solo. ten years was much more balanced.
2179,Blessed,4.85,pours squid ink black and settles in the glass like a black velvet cloak stopping all light sitting under a sudsy dark tan head that dissipates quickly as expected with a beer of this gravity. absolutely gorgeous imperial stout.  i don’t know if the nose of a beer can be decadent but this beer’s nose is with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front some dark cherries and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes.  the taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes and they are rich and chewy moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer.  the mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream. i can’t imagine a more perfect rendering of a ba imperial stout.
2180,Blessed,4.83,if woodford reserve willet and heavenly hill were to get together and make a beery baby they would be so blessed to have this stout. slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give anchorage brewing a love child that can compete with the best.  jet black and pouring like inky tar blessed pours with a luscious ominous and velvety pour. while shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses chocolate whisky oak coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire. once on the tongue the immense sweetness of molasses brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly brownie-batter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness.  as the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush. trailing into a smooth espresso cappuccino character the late taste brings out all of those coconut toasted oak vanilla cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm sultry and savory set of pleasantries.  full bodied pillowy and fortified with nearly port-like proportions the stout is simply magical. it pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm. the warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease.
2181,Blessed,5,top tier.
2182,Blessed,5,05/20/23 bottle @ mimi’s house avl
2183,Blessed,4.54,2022 bottle thick like motor oil black sweet boozy opaque chocolate dark fruits. minimal carbonation that is appropriate for the style. smooth barrel.
2184,Blessed,4.65,2022 vintage. blessed is an excellent beer that has a rich full-bodied taste of dark chocolate and vanilla / marshmallow. nice thick viscosity and mouthfeel with a strong chocolate aroma and easy to drink and enjoy. one of the better beers ive had from anchorage. i think its a little overrated on this list but thats not really a slight - probably more preference than anything. i fail to see how anyone could be disappointed with a pour of blessed.

2187,Black Tuesday,4.07,well this will definitely get you lit. if you want a clean bourbon forward stout then look no further. the barrel is over the top but still under control which makes for an exquisite tasting experience.
2188,Black Tuesday,4.52,finally gotten my hands on a black tuesday. 2021 version. 18.9% abv  pours out a very dark brown liquid with some translucence during the travel from the bottle to the glass. no foam whatsoever. no surprise there. there is a creamy appearance to it though. like chocolate milk towards the center with more light penetration on the outer edges.  nose is straight up strong bourbon and oak against a huge roasted malt backdrop. ethanol is defintely showing itself. chocolate is prevalent here as well. sweet confection like a rich caramel interacts with the chocolate and brightens it up.  on the palate weve got that huge bourbon for sure. oak tannins are strong on this one. that chocolate shows up but gets overshadowed by both barrel influence and roasted malt. some savory notes permeate this brew. this aspect always reminds me of well done street cart pretzels. on the back end there is a beautiful dark chocolate covered coffee bean note that lingers for quite some time.  mouthfeel brings heat not only from the abv but the tannins as well. hot and drying. probably would be better off drinking this in the dead of winter but alas here i am in the dog days of summer.  overall while i very much enjoyed this brew the time its taken me to snag this bottle combined with the ever rising prices of well everything this one didnt quite live up to the reputation placed upon it. perhaps i should have aged this one a little longer. anyway despite that great brew but other breweries do great things that are similar and less costly and even more available.
2189,Black Tuesday,4.3,2021 can stored in a cooler. pours a very dark mahogany brown appearing opaque black in the glass with a fizzy one finger light khaki head that quickly dissipates to sparse patches with slight lacing. aroma of dark toasted malt bourbon dry caramel chocolate; boozy. flavor is bourbon dark toasted malt bakers chocolate raisins dry caramel oaky vanilla and a touch of licorice. hot boozy bourbon finish. medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation. ive tried a lot of bourbon barrel stouts in my day and this is the most bourbon forward that i can remember; almost like a bourbon boilermaker that was extra heavy on the whiskey. fortunately there is a lot of flavor in the base too with good chocolate and oak some dark fruit and caramel that are more reminiscent of a blended strong ale. i was concerned with the fizzy pour but despite the quick fade of the head there is plenty of carbonation. there is a lot of intense flavor at the start of the taste but the bourbon alcohol kicks in and dominates the finish; nice oak and bourbon in the lingering finish. the two years this can has on it has not seemed to mellow the flavor much (and if it has glad i got an aged one). i expected a big boozy stout and this delivered. it is a bit on the unbalanced side from the barrel effect but enjoyable. im glad about the sensible 16oz. can over the traditional the bruery 750s. glad i had a chance to taste this classic.
2190,Black Tuesday,4.47,poured at 54°. black body with some ruby see-through and good clarity; light brown rocky head dissolved quickly leaving no cap retention ring nor lace; thick legs sheet the glass on swirl. nose is bourbon and black licorice; boozy hot retro nasal; molasses as beer warms. bourbon and bittersweet dark chocolate entry; oaky vanilla; molasses middle; hot phenolic finish. hot mouth warmth from 18.9% abv; alcohol bite on tip and sides of tongue; full non adjuncty body; silky feel light carbonation; barrel dry finish. overall you better like boozy (and i do); layers of base and barrel flavors which are well balanced all but for the alcohol which is hot; dry oaky linger; definitely a beer to be enjoyed one sip at a time.
2191,Black Tuesday,3.53,2014 bruery black tuesday 19.7%  seen these on shelves for $50 dollars and it honestly just tastes like deths tar just a bit thinner and a bit less sweety but more boozy even after 8+years . poured out very light brown( i expected a darker and thicker pour for obvious reasons)and settles dark brown into glass. no head whatsoever. a lil bit of bubbles swimmin up like salmon .  tastes is dark chocolate caramel  big dark fruit and heavily roasted malts with a harsh boozy finish. nothing special. way too boozy as well. i feel the burn in my stomach from each sip and it gotten bit overwhelming after 4 sips. mouthfeel is too thin for the high abv in my opinion.  always wanted to try this one and very happy i did. to whoever sent me this one a million thanks cuz much happier i didnt get suckered in to paying what those bastards are asking for these bottles .  im not afan of the bruery mainly cuz of the prices they charge( i get it gotta pay for barrel storage)and weird ass beers they make  but may buy one so happens its tuesday once a year in pint can .  overall i can see why no ones gives a fuck about these guys anymore. this is nothing special compared to a lot of stuff on shelves now and tastes way too hot even after 8 years. makes sense why most members of their beerclub have 750s spoiling in their cellars cuz this is hard to finish and cant imagine getting through half the bottle alone.  update : still have 1/3rd of the bottle in my fridge 3 days later cuz i didnt wanna drink anymore. the price they charge for these is a crime.  pro tip: if you been wondering about this and dont wanna buy cuz of the price tag just buy a bottle of bourbon ... youll be better off
2192,Black Tuesday,4.64,sampled at cigar city brewing’s el catador club xv bottle share party. 2021 vint. 750 ml bottle. poured a hit into a logoed cigar city taster’s glass. little spritz of head doesn’t last at all. smell is bourbon heavy chocolate vanilla bean pod prunes vapor of alcohol. taste threw me back a step with a full assault of molasses creme de cacao dark malt coffee and oak barrel.. then the 19% abv let me know who the boss is. feel is mighty mighty and thick. tounge tar. rich as musk. low carb. overall damn. i stood there and refilled my 4 ounce taster’s glass couple of times more and had to go sit down. drink some agua. serious barrel aged big stout..

2203,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.25,great example of the style. medium to high carbonated with a long lasting foam head. no lacing. super zesty and crispy mouthfeel and aroma. pleasant aftertaste!
2204,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.07,well the back label unfortunately fell off of this one so the bottling date is unknown. at least it’s a weizenbock so even if it’s older it’s probably holding up pretty well. it’s always fun to try this style since you rarely see them and this is one of the classic examples. let’s crack it open  pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose here is very bright yet gentle at the same time. i’m picking up on aromas of orange zest sweet homey bready malt overripe banana clove toasted grain floral hops toffee and bubblegum  in taste it seems more raw and unrefined leaning hard into the phenols. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting bready malt sweet honey clove burnt sugar bubblegum earthy wheat peppery hops and light banana. the swallow brings notes of clove banana bread sweet honey toffee orange zest black pepper light toast and earthy wheat  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a creamy beer. finishes neutral and balanced  it’s not the best example of the style but still damn good. worth trying if you’re into weizenbocks
2205,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.09,cloudy amber/orange appearance. medium light carbonation with an above average body. has a creamy thick feel which adds up to a really nice feel. aroma is banana banana breadclovemaltbreadand earthy. taste is mildly sweetbanana breadfresh banana clove malt and bread. overall an excellent well done beer
2206,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.28,500 ml bottle  pours a cloudy golden color bright white head. great head retention. aroma of golden wheat and spicy phenols. similar flavor starts off with herbal clove spiciness then finishes with sweeter grainy malt. good balance. medium to fuller bodied coats the mouth. overall very enjoyable
2207,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.4,appearance: pours a slightly cloudy (70% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. srm of 9. (4.25)  aroma: strong and bready aromas of bread malt bubble gum bread spices. yeast and cloves. some hints of citrus. lots of bubblegum.  flavor: strong and bready flavors of bread malt bubble gum orange citrus within. yeasty bread malt and spiced with a slightly sweet bread malt and orange citrus off the finish. hints of some dark fruits of apricot plum raisin. mildly sweet but relatively dry.  feel: medium-bodied strong carbonation and finishes mildly sweet but clean. some bubblegum and citrus linger  compared to weihenstephaner vitus 11/2022: pours a darker color. more wheat and orange citrus flavors. less bread bubble gum and cloves. winner: ayinger  compared to schneider weisse tap 6 mein adventinus 2/2023: pours lighter. similar head. slightly more orange citrus banana bubblegum and spice. less sweet and rich caramel notes. winner: ayinger  overall: only my second of the style but clearly a fantastic weizenbock. nice orange citrus and wheat flavors with just enough bread spice and bubblegum in the yeast to invite another sip. relatively clean and dry. extremely flavorful and drinkable. nice orange citrus bubblegum yeast. this one is perfection. (rating: 4.40)
2208,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.55,on tap at peas & honey.  pours a hazy golden orange with thick soft head.  smell is sweet and fruity with notes of banana banana candy cream orange cloves and estery yeast.  taste is rich creamy and sweet. notes of banana banana candy citrus white bread cloves and yeast.  mouthfeel is thick smooth and well carbonated.  overall an outstanding weizenbock. ticks all the boxes.
2209,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.93,poured into hefeweizen glass from 500 ml bottle hazy dark golden with 4 fingers of white head smell: bananas and wheat taste: delicious blend of citrus bananas and classic weissbier goodness. the 7.1 abv is undetectable. the taste of this beer deserves nothing less than 5 out of 5. feel: full-bodied with moderate carbonation. overall: drinking this cold beer on a hot summer day put a smile on my face. i am looking forward to trying another one.
2210,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.47,featuring primarily malt and yeast this beer is very creamy. hints of banana and cloves while definitely not overbearing are presented alongside a healthy bread like texture that is just a pleasure to drink. festive yet somehow everyday. classic german workmanship!
2211,Cass Fresh,3,en restaurante coreano gangnam. en copa de alhambra. sin ser nada del otro mundo cumple su cometido de refrescar el picante adecuadamente
2212,Cass Fresh,3.29,out of a bottle at the prince in korea town los a feels ca.  well straight up it’s pretty flat as if van gogh was on zoloft. like there’s not a lot going on here. as if vincent was just dull blank faced and sad (even more so i suppose). no wild spirit in this one. no “hurray!” ok i’m out.
2213,Cass Fresh,2.84,hey come on it is definitely not awful. yeah i know it’s the same adjunct cr@p and yeah it’s watered down and the aftertaste is quite bad and metallic. but it feels better than most japanese beers that they have here in japan. korean lagers are always better somehow. abd not to mention that it goes very well with korean food! you can’t even feel its aftertaste… :)
2214,Cass Fresh,2.11,330 ml bottle from green peas stavanger. abv is 4.5%. clear pale golden colour moderate white head. sweetish aroma of pilsener malts starch grass and candy. fizzy mouthfeel. medium sweet flavour with the same elements as the aroma very moderate hops.
2215,Cass Fresh,2.27,the secret to drinking cass:  step 1. buy it in the large plastic bottle variety...multiple bottles  step 2. buy bottles of soju.....multiple bottles  step 3. in a safe location; ie; barracks room day room place of residence etc.... pour beer into a solo cup pour a shot or two of soju in solo cup  step 4. drink and enjoy...responsibly....or something
2216,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,3.38,look: clear gold with about a half inch white head; good retention.  smell: sweet malts and hops.  taste: follows smell blend of sweet and earthy/bitter. aftertaste is more on the bitter side.  feel: normal carbonation medium-light body.  overall: solid drinkable brew.
2217,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,3.94,12oz bottle into a pint glass. best by 4/4/24.  looks nice crystal clear pale golden body with a small white head soecks of lacing. faint malty aroma. clean slightly sweet taste clean finish n ok aftertaste. better than expected.
2218,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,4.09,330 ml poured into a pint glass. pour is deep straw/ light gold in color fairly clear and with an easily regenerated cap of foam. aroma is lightly hopped and offers some rich malt notes notes of lemony hops as the cap settles. taste follows with a rich but not sweet malt delivery. lemony notes return on the finish. feel is quite full and fits the style but not obviously sweet some complex malt residuals add depth. nice base malt gives a good balance for the style. abv right in the zone. overall i think it edges out paulaner by a nose....
2219,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,3.81,picked up a single at tw-greenville sc 9-24-22 for $1.49. best before 5-23-23; consumed 1-24-23. cold stored since purchase.  beer poured gold with a very nice white head.  nose is biscuity with a touch of honey.  taste is a biscuity malt base that has a kiss of honey. hopping is very balancing as i am not finding this with any residual sweetness.  mouthfeel is light and refreshing.  overall an enjoyable fest bier!
2220,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,3.4,draft beer poured into a pilsner glass.  color is a clear golden yellow with a 1 finger head that laces nicely. aroma is slightly bready and mild not as spicy or malty as most of the darker märzens ive had. taste follows the nose with little carbonation.  overall a good but not great. but i would drink it again.
2221,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,4.02,deep brassy gold tone compact yet fluffy head of foam drippy lacing. doughy aroma malt and yeast both present. light and flavorful mild bread crust toastiness vague earthy noble hop aftertaste. slight malt sweetness initially becoming dry on the finish. light creamy feel good structure and body. overall i’m glad i got a six of this and that it’s fresh. more aligned with festbier on style than märzen.
2222,Midnight Still,4.53,2020 version poured from a bottle into a snifter. this is nicely thick with a strong fudge flavor.
2223,Heineken Lager Beer,3.58,poured from bottle into glass.  clear bubbly straw color. capped with a tight bright white head. good retention and lacing.  smells skunky cabbage lemon grass cracker malt.  tastes skunky lemon cabbage grass dough white pepper grassy finish.  bubbly smooth creamy crisp.  not a bad lager. better on tap or from a can to avoid skunkiness. enjoyable though.
2224,Heineken Lager Beer,3.65,can version. pours a clear golden color. white head formation. prwtty basic beer. no complains here. cheap and easy drinking. does the job well in a nice summer day.
2225,Heineken Lager Beer,5,a very crisp and clean lager. very refreshing and easy to drink. didn’t experience any skunk with the green bottles. tasted fine. not a bad beer to quench your thirst with. goes with anything. very crushable. i recommend it. cheers!
2226,Heineken Lager Beer,2.52,okay in a can. always super skunked in a bottle.
2227,Heineken Lager Beer,3.75,draft on barcelona beach.
2228,Heineken Lager Beer,4,the bottle looks cool and it tastes like a heineken.  style: holland lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 5% | rating: 4
2229,Heineken Lager Beer,2.93,doest what it says on the tin. probably better than most of its corporate brothers. can only rate it in relative terms. its grand.
2230,Heineken Lager Beer,3.75,pours a 3 finger head into kolsch styled glass. moderate to high lacing clean flavor with slight malt flavor and tangy hops. dry finsh. classic lager beer best acquired in enclosed cases or cans.
2231,Heineken Lager Beer,3.46,poured from bottle into pint glass look: clear yellow. standard lager appearance 1 finger of quickly dissipating head. smell: clean and crisp. hints of malt. taste: refreshing clean classic lager taste. feel: moderate-to-high carbonation. light-bodied. overall: i remember drinking this beer decades ago when i first turned 21 and i recall and distinct skunky odor and taste (which i attributed to the green bottle letting in too much light): i am very happy that skunky flavor and aroma is now gone (im not sure what the heineken corporation did since they still use the same green bottles) and the result is a clean and refreshing lager.
2232,Heineken Lager Beer,2.64,i like drinking matching beers to occasions that make sense to me. this was my grandfathers favorite beer im drinking it late night on what would have been his one hundredth birthday.  22 oz bottle acclimated to 48°f and poured into a pilsner glass.  pours a clear very slightly pale (pale in saturation not in pitch) yellow gold with a 1 finger foamy white head.  initial aroma is that quintessential lager smell crisp with slight hops. somewhat skunky and diluted to my nose. after agitating it smells a little cleaner overall. a deal has been struck to quench thirst and fulfill expectation not to excel in any field.  initial taste before swallowing is a little skunky and hoppy. after swallowing i get a minor amount of hops and bitterness. sweetness like that in cheap white bread and maltiness akin to malt vinegar. its a little dry. overall this is a lager that exists.  mouthfeel is fine smoother than some ive had but it honestly doesnt do anything special.  i may buy heineken again likely not. as stated in the beginning i purchased it because it was my grandfathers favorite and im drinking it to honor his 100th birthday. maybe as a once a year occasion for his birthday. its one of those that you need to be in the right headspace for. i met it head on knowing full well it would not exceed expectations but that does not excuse its lackluster performance as far as raw numbers go. sorry grampy i know you loved it.
2233,Moosehead Light,2.6,no beer has ever been more sought after. is it heady topper? no. tree house? pliny? no no and no. it did however prove to be about the most elusive beer in our collection. we have been trying to get a hold of this for the better part of 5 years. for one reason or another the moose remained loose. we tried ordering it in through total wine. no dice. we tried calling the moosehead rep at a different liquor store. same result. this was all before the pandemic meaning no trips to canada for md. finally this summer after two years of no boarder crossing we brought moose light home. it went down like nothing as the boys gathered for a weekend in maine. the beer was fine. regular moose is better without a doubt. much more flavor but moose light while elusive was a pretty standard light beer experience.
2234,Moosehead Light,2.66,poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is very mild a touch of grains. taste is weak some hints of beer? nothing offensive just not much there at all. feels light bodied in the mouth and overall is a below average example of this style.
2235,Moosehead Light,3.5,look 3.5 smell 3.5 taste 3.5 feel 3.5 overall 3.5
2236,Moosehead Light,2.6,light bodied not very flavorful. a half step above club soda. tastes like beer flavored carbonated water. its a hometown staple where im from so its very common and accessible so i try to be more objective when tasting this beer.
2237,Moosehead Light,3,just a solid light canadian beer. very refreshing. better than molson canadian light. good job moosehead.
2238,Moosehead Light,3.37,moosehead breweries ltd. moosehead light 12 fl. oz. green glass bottle production coded but without freshness dating  notes via stream of consciousness: not surprisingly moosehead light tastes a lot like moosehead it\s just not as rich nor as hoppy. i\ll assume that they\re just adding water to lighten it but it could be more complicated than that. i doubt there\s any high-gravity brewing going on that produces more than just one beer though it\s too clean and balanced for that. it\s very well made and the balance that you find in the regular moosehead remains intact; it\s just a little lighter and more refreshing. of course i still prefer the standard moosehead but if i have to have a light beer this is one of my go-to lights. so let me run through its good points and bad points as compared to the regular. #1 the appearance is not as good. the clear straw-gold body is nice but the head retention and lacing are lacking. #2 the nose is lacking. the beautiful combination of sweetish grainy malt and herbal and floral hops found in the original just isn\t there. it\s still ok for a light beer but not nearly as full or bright. #3 just like the aroma the flavor is watered down (most likely literally). there\s some grainy malt which is nice and some lightly floral and softly herbal hops but it\s not completely satisfying. again as a light beer it works and the cleanliness and balance are impeccable. #4 the finish is good. it remains dry but with some malt and hop character remaining which is rare for light beers as they usually just disappear from the palate. #5 the body suffers a little bit but not by too much and the carbonation is gently crisp. it\s not too watery. conclusion: it\s at the very least refreshing i think everyone will give it that but it\s also fairly satisfying - it\s like you\re drinking a real beer and not some hop-less and almost malt-less carbonated-water. two thumbs up as far as light beers go!
2239,Moosehead Light,2.07,clear yellowish liquid in a green bottle. aroma of corn rice husk and a bit of skunky hops. the flavor has crisp adjunct flavor and a small mineral and skunky hop presence. light bodied carbonated well. subpar beer.
2240,Moosehead Light,2.1,pours the color if ginger ale. pretty much a watered-down version of the standard moosehead lager. the skunkiness in the lager is lessened but so is the general flavor.
2241,Moosehead Light,2.08,from club del gourmet of el corte ingles. in ikeas pilsner glass. watchig worst week 1x05. another industrial lager and worst than the typical one
2242,Moosehead Light,2.6,a-pours a golden color with a slight head and lacing a-aroma has lemongrass hints t-the taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor m-a medium bodied decently carbonated beer o-a decent beer
2243,Last Buffalo In The Park,4.52,man this beer ruled when i first had it. definitely one to drink fresh and not age. ton of coconut and barrel. i dont hear a ton about fb these days but this beer was great!
2244,Last Buffalo In The Park,4.29,both last snow and this in the same year neat! jet black body with a brown head standard but well done. huge coconut right away in the nose bourbon is present but light get bakers chocolate and caramel more. taste is surprisingly similar while coconut laden nose is fun want more barrel for the taste. malt work stabilizes the complexion though with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish. the feel is very smooth but it is light in both body and barrel coconut defines somehow even more than ls. like last snow better but still a nice porter. coconut fans this one is for you!
2245,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,4.35,750 ml corked & caged bottle from the lcbo; best before 02/07/2020 and served slightly chilled. this review is mostly for my own personal interest given the fact that its like 3 years past due.  pours a foggy reddish-burgundy colour with some flaky sediment that eventually settles at the base of the glass. nearly an inch of bubbly off white-tinted head dissipates within a matter of minutes; a thin collar is the only noticeable remnant. potent aromas of cherry juice and raspberries paired with hints of oak baking spice vanilla cranberry and red grapes; restrained suggestions of balsamic vinegar and funk.  a masterful fusion of sweet red fruit flavours and sour oaked red ale notes - the cherry and raspberry come through first joined by notes of cranberry and red grape shortly thereafter making for a decidedly fruity forefront. hints of oak vanilla baking spice and subtle balsamic acidity develop later on with a touch of earthy funk lingering into an aftertaste of cherry pit apples oak and red fruits especially cranberry. medium-full in body with moderate carbonation that feels gentle and frothy; smooth soft mouthfeel. normally these 750 ml bottles of rodenbach are overkill for a single person but cr is so easy drinking and the abv is so well-integrated that polishing it off should be no trouble at all.  final grade: 4.35 an a grade. i honestly dont think caractère rouge is the #1 example of its style... however theres a strong argument to be made that its the best *introductory* flemish red available. its ample red fruit flavours add a prominent juicy-sweetness to the profile counteracting the innate sour/funky qualities of the underlying red ale. its also worth mentioning that the base ale itself is much less assertively acidic and funky than say rodenbachs grand cru or their vintage series making for a more approachable & drinkable glass of beer (though perhaps not as complex). still an excellent sour - likely not worth cellaring but based on this experience a (properly stored) 5-6 y.o. bottle will hold up fine. highly recommended.
2246,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,4.25,375ml bottle cant find a bottling year or best-by date.  look: beautiful clear ruby red but points subtracted for the visible sediment at the bottom of my half pour. basically no head. no carbonation visible.  smell: red wine dark and fruity and tart.  taste: cherry changing to raspberry with a sweetness that comes and goes. the cranberry appears most in the aftertaste. not as dry as my nose was expecting; in fact its pretty sweet. i took this out of the fridge but im not getting the complexity i hoped for.  feel: a little tingly even though i cant see any bubbles. moderate mouthfeel not particularly light or heavy.  overall: tasty and fun good balance between tart and sweet but i have to admit i was hoping for more. i have no idea how old this bottle is or how it has been stored. im perfectly willing to believe that a well-stored bottle would have more to say for itself.
2247,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,4.34,750ml bottle into a tall glass. bottled 2/19/2018 after 30 months on foeders the last 6 resting on cherries raspberries and cranberries.  looks good in the glass. dark reddish brown body. small off white bubbly head fizzes away quite quickly no lacing.  splendid mixed berry fruit aroma.  on tasting the cherry and raspberry tart sweetness comes through very cleanly before the drink effortlessly moves into a drying sour berry fruit taste.  mouth between medium and full finish sour tart and drying with a nice berry residue.  overall another suberb flanders red from rodenbach. the care and time that goes into producing this beer is worth every penny to this drinker.
2248,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,4.68,poured from 750 ml bottle into tulip. a: pours a clear red amber hue with essentially no head. s: loads of fresh cherries raspberries and cranberries. sour and sweet with a hint of earthy spice and soft oak. lovely! t: closely follows aroma. sour/sweet cherries fresh raspberries and cranberries. earthy spice soft oak and subtle belgian yeast. m: light-medium body. nice balance of sweet and sour. soft oak. dry throughout. lingers nicely on the palate. d: a superb brew and example of style.
2249,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,4.75,pours a nice reddish color with a slight head and lacing aroma has generous cherry raspberry and cranberry hints the taste follows the nose with a wonderful complex cherry raspberry and cranberry flavor a light bodied well carbonated beer a great flanders red
2250,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,4.27,appearance: pours a tawny amber color with a thin cap that quickly fades to a ringlet; dotty lacing  smell: oaky with cranberry and cherry tones most prominent; hints of vanilla graham cracker and caramel  taste: cranberry and tart cherry blend with caramel and graham cracker flavors at the outset with the vanilla and raspberry softening the intial impact; oaky and moderately sour through the finish  mouthfeel: medium body with very low carbonation  overall: this is a older bottle and while full of flavor may have lost some carbonation in cellar; terrific flavors however
2251,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,4.74,poured from a 750ml bottle in to a tulip glass.  look: has a nice clear red color with a short lasting white head  smell: smells of berries and slightly sweet also with an acidic touch  taste: tastes closely with how it smells although with very little sweetness overall which is a good thing to me for this type of beer.  feel: slightly fizzy not a heavy beer  overall: usually with size of beer im a believer in sharing with someone else to then move on to another but i am always tempted to hog this one. will drink it whenever i find available.
2252,Honker's Ale,3,deep copper orange in color. head fades quickly leaving a bit of lacing. there is not much to be found in the nose very subdued. taste approximates what you would expect of the style but there was a very slight hint of smokiness in the aftertaste. mouthfeel is smooth with understated carbonation. this is a fairly inoffensive take on a style that is overlooked by many brewers. not bad but not really anything to go out of your way for.
2253,Honker's Ale,3.71,the first beer of my trip to chicago for riot fest! honkers is one of those beers always spoken fondly of by old school bas and i figure there’s no better way to start off the trip than with this beer i don’t see in massachusetts. let’s dive in  pours a cloudy deep orange amber with 2 fingers of light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  it doesn’t have all that much presence in the nose but what’s there is pretty good. i’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt floral hops lemon zest honey and light pepper  it’s a bit more expressive in taste but still not a punch in the face or anything. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting herbal hops crackery malt honey orange zest and green tea. the swallow brings notes of black tea floral hops biscuity malt honey toasted grain and light orange  a light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a crisp beer. finishes mostly dry but a bit watery  this is nothing amazing but i wasn’t expecting anything amazing. this is a mediocre example of an old school style from a bygone era. that being said it’s still a really enjoyable beer to drink despite its flaws
2254,Honker's Ale,3.03,liked it wouldnt b my go to but i can drink
2255,Honker's Ale,4.16,smooth drink
2256,Honker's Ale,3.59,the first esb i ever tried and i thought i hated the style until i tried fuller’s esb which is really great. turns out the problem isn’t the style it is that this is a mediocre tasting ale at best.
2257,Honker's Ale,3.84,on draft at goose island clybourn 1/15/21  reddish amber hues with thin white head. dark malt and and some dark fruits on the nose. sweet malt breadiness hint of fruits and mildy bitter taste. its fairly light and easy on the palate. this was my first goose island beer and i will always come back to it. its a great sessionable esb.
2258,Honker's Ale,3.77,was once one of my go-to options in the days of independent goose island; this was my standard bearer for esbs for some time. the post ab-inbev offering isn\t as appealing; the most recent offerings seem to lack the maltiness and body i enjoyed previously. the scores above reflect an average of pre/post acquisition.
2259,Slow Pour Pils,4.37,enjoyed this slow pour at the source.  time to see what all the hype and/or fuss has been about! this pours beautifully. certainly the creamy tuff of foam atop makes this visually distinct. gentle aroma with an underlying spiciness on the sip.  it’s the experience that makes this. i didn’t get anything to go because i just don’t think it would compare.
2260,Slow Pour Pils,3.98,golden yellow with large cap of white foam. nice malt with a good bite and cracker from the malts. crisp.
2261,Slow Pour Pils,4.28,16oz can. stamped on can bottom is 2.05.22. clear pale gold colored body. first pour produces a three finger white head which reduces to a bubbly cap and ring. each successive pour results in a one finger head which stays around a bit. leaves behind strings and spots of lacing. aroma of toasty malts that smells of bread and biscuit products and herbal/grassy hops. taste is sweet bready malt with some spicy hops that express herbal and grassy. slight mineral note at the end. all tail off in the aftertaste. fuller mouth feel with carbonated bubbles. dry finish. crisp finish. excellent carbonation. crisp and clean sweeter pilsner with a very good balance of malts and hops.
2262,Slow Pour Pils,4.17,the presentation was classic--a tall thin cylinder pilsner glass filled with liquid of the brightest gold with a thin pure-white cap. as refreshing as this beer looks in the glass it is twice as crisp going down. snappy crisp bread and biscuit flavor with that authentically german dab bite. bierstadt should be proud of this one--highly recommended.
2263,Slow Pour Pils,4.37,at the bierstadt this was memorable. served in a narrow pokal the head is like nothing ive ever seen -- kind of hard-shaped foam that sticks around for ever and leaves some nice lacing. the nose is pilsner malt -- fresh and bready -- and the noble hops are solid but not aggressive. taste: wow this is incredibly smooth and soft like pillowy. a little hoppy edge but no bite and it doesnt dry out either. guess that tells me that im used to amped up and more aggressively hopped american-style pils. well this one isnt in your face at all but it has some great depth of flavor. theres a little mineral quality in there too which i wasnt expecting. construction of this beer is top notch.
2264,Slow Pour Pils,3.89,had on tap at the brewery with the true slow pour.  on arrival to the tablet he head was almost stylized looking like soft serve ice cream above the rim of the glass. the body is a clear golden straw with quite active carbonation. some nice lacing is formed.  aroma is decent lots of fermentation character backed by earthy noble hops. some malts are detectable but they are quite light compared to everything else going on  taste is nicer than the aroma with a nice noble hop bite and some lingering bitterness without becoming a hoppy lager. a crackery malt shines through in the flavor quite nicely. spicy light and malty a true traditional pils with just a little extra bitterness.  feel on the slow pour is beautiful. i could see myself drinking this as a great refresher too bad id have to come to the brewery to truly experience it. creamy head up top with a body that carries a good carbonation bite. some good contrast. extremely drinkable even with coming here on the last stop of a brewery hop the first glass was gone quick.  overall this is a very traditional german pils brewed here in denver. flavor is spicy and malty with a good bitterness and the slow pour at the brewery is very nice even if you gotta wait for it.
2265,Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,4.14,l -- pours pretty still in the glass even with aerated pour. some congealed coconut fat in suspension. s -- coconut macaroon caramel vanilla apple brandy ceylon cinnamon marshmallow. really nice and decadent t -- largely follows the nose. rich and as advertised f -- chunks of coconut fat in suspension were no good. otherwise a nice viscosity o -- solid offering here probably worth the cost of entry at least once  83/100
2266,Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,4.53,3/10/2019 - apple to nose with hint of coconut. silky mf smooth on palate. well balanced with the vanilla
2267,Gggreennn!,4.9,#183 yummy!
2268,Gggreennn!,4.43,look - fantastic hazy honey orange with a nice thick white head and sticky smell - wow so much going on here and very tropical! citrus grapefruit lemon with some pineapple and dankness. pretty gggreennn taste - definitely green with a citrus yellow grapefruit slight lemon tropical pineapple. a slight pine taste a a slight bite. feel - medium full body with a medium carb overall - pretty nice ne but still slight mix of a west coast
2269,Gggreennn!,4.68,treehouse green dialed up to 11. my favorite of the green family.
2270,Gggreennn!,4.69,16 oz can dated 7/31/23  obtained through the online ordering protocol at sandwich so give me credit for that. pond murk haze as it should be. two fingers varied cream head. full curtain lacing and surface cap. profound grapefruit and pine aromas. guava tangerine pineapple light green pepper flavors. creamy smooth mouthfeel good carbonation lightly sweet aftertaste. classified as an aipa by tree house exceptional.
2271,Gggreennn!,4.6,appearance: pours a cloudy pear nectar color with a two finger head; good retention with shards and squiggles creating a wall of lacing  smell: dank and juicy aromatics with pineapple lemon apricot and tangerine pith  taste: very juicy from the outset with pineapple and lemon forward with developing tangerine pith; moderate bitterness that grows into the finish with a hint of graham cracker sweetness underneath  mouthfeel: medium to full body with moderate carbonation; somewhat creamy  overall: all of the green series have been exemplary so far  thanks speedwayjim for the opportunity
2272,Gggreennn!,4.5,pours a nice pale orange color nice fluffy yep finger head falls slowly great lace.  aroma is nice smooth fruity orange mango pineapple apricot all before you get to green hop resin.  taste follows the nose nice fruity smooth almost lightly sweet then the hops appear and push back a little. then you get some light dankness coming thru pine herbal maybe even a little grassy.  mouthfeel is a solid medium with carbonation that is smooth and mellow prefect fit for this ipa.  overall a wonderful beer the best treehouse i have had to date.
2273,Gggreennn!,4.25,16oz. can served in a spiegelau tulip. pours a burnished orange with a hazy clarity and a loose quarter-inch bright white head. nose reveals orange pith and perhaps essence of apricot at the finish. taste consistent with nose with the addition of a strong herbal presence that lingers between quaffs. mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation. overall solid; however not my favorite offering from th.
2274,Gose Gone Wild,4.47,22 oz bomber into a pilsner glass  so ive had this brew in my mini-fridge for years now. like years. id sampled it before i bought it and had asked my bottle-shop friend if he had any more; he didnt so i kinda horded it away. anyway i figured it was now or never a brew with this low a gravity just cant age forever no matter how cold its maintained. and generally speaking thats truth but in this case i seemed to have happened upon an anomaly - im drinking this beer as i type this and its as delicious as i remember it.  golden straw-yellow in appearance a sudsy head forms on an easy pour. tart crisp grassy bouquet with subtle suggestions of unripe berries. more sour on the palate than in the nose lemony nuances compliment the brews oaky dryness with bittering hops ushering in one of cleanest shortest finishes youll experience in a brew. eminently refreshing. now i might be regretting not leaving this thing in the fridge for another few years or so. oh well.
2275,Gose Gone Wild,4.5,this is a fun and interesting beer. it has a lot of similarities to other stillwater sours like moneytree and hopvine bling. the shell is very fruity with berries melon lemon and also some hay. the taste is tart and refreshing. i thought the brett would add more funk but it comes through with more fruity flavors. there is a subtle hint of rustic barnyard in the background but you have to look for it. overall very rewarding and delicious. yb
2276,Gose Gone Wild,4.21,i got a late start on this past sundays nbs (week 774) & i did not finish up my delmarva (+ dc) adventure as planned. 8=( further i have promised that next weeks nbs (week 775) will be dedicated to the wonderful beers sent to me by @jkblr who seems to have a real handle on my drinking habits. cansparency is key in these things! as a result i am going to cancentrate over the next few days on eradicating everything that would have canbined to form the finale of the delmarva (+ dc) adventure. sit down strap in & hang on. its gonna be a wild ride!  speaking of wild thanks to staying with bal & md i now have a leipzig gose as my next beer! if this keeps up im going to get my status as a hophead in good standing revoked! 8=(  from the can: dry-hopped sour wheat ale fermented with brettanomyces.  i did some light in-cangitation before crack!ing open the vent on this one. i wanted to ensure that any flocculation that may have taken place in the interim was now back in suspension. following the crack! i went with a hard aggro glug into the awaiting glass. this led to the formation of just over a finger of fizzy foamy rocky bone-white head with low retention quickly falling to wisps. color was an oh-so-faintly-hazy straw-yellow (srm = > 2 < 4). they must have gone light on the brett since although i could smell it i also got a really pleasant whiff of salt! mmm. i love the smell of salt! mouthfeel was thin-to-medium not watery but not far removed either. the taste had the funkified taste of brett but not in an over-the-top way. instead it was lightly tart not at all sour with a lemony saltiness that i really dug! dang this was a recent purchase (yesterday) simply because i am immersed in stillwater artisanal beers at the moment & i am really digging it! what a find. finish was dry of course but not puckering or unpleasant as some have been. yum! ymmv.
2277,Gose Gone Wild,3.98,1 pt 6 fl. oz. bottle served in a sour glass  this beer pours a brilliant pale yellow. the head is fleeting and leaves no trace of its existence.  the smell is tart citrus with some dank basement funk aroma.  the taste follows the smell. it starts with tart citrus. funk is in the finish and aftertaste along with a citrus tang.  it is nice to have a nice clean traditional version of this style instead of the trendy imperial fruit slushy versions. this is very well crafted and quite refreshing.
2278,Black Albert,4.02,if you are looking for a stout with a complex fruit profile this is for you. lots of chocolate and roasted malt but also dark fruit cherry and tobacco create a nuanced experience.
2279,Black Albert,4.29,batch 0 vintage 2020
2280,Black Albert,4.62,from a 330 ml bottle with a vintage of 3/22/22 and a bb date of 7/22/26 + 5 years. sampled june 15 2023.  deep dark brown to basically a jet black appearance with a small quickly fading tan head. limited lacing.  many aroma sensations of dark roasted bread crust dark roasted malts dark fruit bkack cherry plum cranberry graham crackers cream licorice but little to no alcohol for 13%.  full mouthfeel. creamy smooth.  sweet roasted malt taste with more dark fruit and little to no booziness. a lingering warming finish. this is really good.
2281,Black Albert,4.5,2016 vintage. the pour is jet black with a small head of foam. the taste is belgian candy sugar bakers dark chocolate roasted malts black cherry & molasses. the 13% abv is drinking more like a 9% abv beer. cheers! a (world class)
2282,Black Albert,4.16,poured into the test glass from 11.2 oz bottle with ba no. 14 brs brew on the label. a - chalkboard black with a thin off white ring of assembled bubbles a slow moving archipelago in the center of the ring. s - burnt brown sugar cigar wrap tobacco drying in the barn dark cocoa hint of soy and anise. t - black pepper corn bakers chocolate again a hint of tobacco with dark fruits being the center fig dried plum with again hint of anise. m - medium bordering to to heavy in body full palate coating while avoiding the syruppy trap start is semi sweet with lingering bitterness acting as the clean up agent finish is just dry enough to invite another sip. o - a lovely sipper excellent ris characteristics with rich complex flavors well hidden alcohol and luxurious texture.
2283,Black Albert,4.7,from a bottle 08/2022 at brick store decatur ga. wonderful aroma couldve just taken in the aroma and not even drank any of it and wouldve been great. but the powerful complex array of flavors combined with unbeatable mouthfeel for an imperial stoudt put it over the top
2284,Black Albert,4.5,2015 vintage  a: poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a dense and rocky finger of dark tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing s: smells of dark roasted malts bitter dark chocolate anise raisins and espresso t: taste is dark chocolate coffee roasted malts hints of oxidation some slight smoke and charred wood with a hint of burnt sugars. on the swallow theres some sweetness along with more coffee chocolate charred wood and burnt sugar m: this beer is thick and velvety on the palate. carbonation is low but adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish from the high abv. o: overall this is a really well done russian imperial stout. it has good flavors and a nice amount of complexity. it may have lost a step at this age but its still drinking very well.
2285,Black Albert,4.28,330 ml bottle as struise black albert batch ’0’ - ba no. 14 brs brew. abv is 13%. pitch black colour moderate brown head. exquisite aroma of roasted malts fine chocolate and coffee liquorice and hops. warming mouthfeel. rich and medium sweet flavour of roasted malts chocolate fortified wine and coffee.

2287,Black Albert,4.01,#1696 - blind-tasted except for the beers name and brewery/country zero reviews below read (yet!)... l- jet-black to the eye pours with brief 2mm dark tan head soon a scattered patch unsurprising given the abv% s- like cold brit xmas pudding condensed into a liquid deeply fruity and pungent plus molasses notes. t- wow a deep brewed fruity thickness and pungency. then a blazing shaft of lightly sour + mega-abv% that makes me involuntarily physically shudder thankfully briefly. jeez gawds this thing is intense. im getting like ultra-deep concentrated prune juice notes -> back to the molasses in the smell. f- its mega deep rich/complex yet also notably has a sour aspect too. o- good grief what is this thing!? the abv isnt *that* high but this thing is an absolute beast. yes its interesting and a heck of a statement but i dont think i really need 330ml of it - it would be a lot more interesting if i had a couple of buddies over and could share 110ml each pre a session of other less slaying brews. interesting to try but to me its one of those huge one off statements you experience but wouldnt buy again; this is simply not a normal beer. oh and for context it is 1000% the complete antithesis of a session beer. the abv% isnt even *that* high as any icelandic beer-head will attest... its one of those beers that is so different and really hard to know how to rate. mega flavour/mega naked and shouty abv% complete blaster on the palate. quite probably the most intense beer ive ever had (that is not of course a clear compliment). is this aged in wine casks? that might be the sour note... review/scoring all done now the reveal i get to read the bottle lables to see what i missed! ==> unfilt unpast. bot-con. thats all. does it in fact taste like beer? as i get to the lower 1/4 glass it strikes me more like a noxious dry fortified wine. im laching stout notes and certainly more usual russian imp stout notes.... 330ml bottle bb: 02/10/2020+5yrs £5.95 bought from beautifulbeers uk as part of a large pick-your own consignment to london.
2288,Black Albert,4.14,had a touch of a soy sauce flavor but overall was an outstanding stout that i enjoyed very much.
2289,JJJuliusss!,4.52,thanks nick! vigorous pour produces an amazing smell. taste follows juice bomb really tasty. great medium feel. overall everything i would expect from this legendary brewery. touche!
2290,JJJuliusss!,4.32,from a 16oz can into a tulip. drank this last night and i forgot to record the canning date. sometime mid-november 2022. can message: stay gold pony boy  pours an opaque brownish orange with about one finger of white head. incredible lacing and retention.  strong aromas of oranges and earth/dirt.  taste follows but mellows on warming with a little less distinctness.  soft medium to full-bodied mouthfeel. bitter aftertaste. medium carbonation.  this beer is excellent-for what it is. seems to be missing that little something extra that most of their dipas have. that said if you hand me one of these i\m gonna drink it. smiling.
2291,JJJuliusss!,4.52,its with a jaw tightening lip smacking mouth watering series of sensations that gives tree houses power packed julius a newer and juicier life thatll leave us stuttering for more.  the excellence in jjjuliusss is felt starting with a similarly creamy peach and golden blend of colors and airy textures as the original julius. the beers dense and foggy appearance only works to make it more appetizing. a slow separation of ale from froth suggests a viscous character that carries over to an even more creamy tangy sweet and fruity taste just after a grassy citrusy herbal and piney perfume than any before.  less grassy and herbal in taste the flavors that explode on the middle palate are dominant with all-things-orange. tangerine in all its tangy fructose-sweet branch-ripe and fresh squeezed vibrance springs to life with a zesty support of red grapefruit lemon and lime. tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple and kiwi nuances. smooth in the beers fleeting taste a sense of bitter sherbet with citrus zest apply their final and lasting contributions to balance.  creamy and malty-dry the taste starts fuller and plush but trailing bitter herbal and dry the soft sappiness of freshly shaven spruce links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative texture and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns itself with sorbet desserts- its surprising that a single sixteen ounce can can hold so much flavor.
2292,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.53,pours super hazy taste is a mix of lemon pineapple and some other light citrus - great hop bite but no bitterness. love this series in general but surprised this is on the top 250 over a few other options from oh. very good beer - not world class.
2293,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.65,well made beer here. awesome flavors aromas and superb mouthfeel. anything ive had oh x mosaic has been above average for me. long live mosaic hops!
2294,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,3.4,pours hazy caution light yellow in color with one inch head. taste is lemon pineapple and dank hops. heavy body slightly bitter moderate carbonation. not bad but have had a lot better from other half. good with a four pack.
2295,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.39,hazy yellow-gold. somewhat foamy.  aroma: mango pineapple dank sweet.  flavors: tropical follows the nose.  very creamy round velvety. extremely pleasant. while the aroma/flavors are nothing extraordinary for this style i absolutely love the creaminess here.
2296,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.57,brewers notes: double dry-hopped oat imperial ipa with mosaic hops lactose and oats  purchased at empire liquors  poured into a spiegelau ipa glass  is a hazy pale orange liquid capped by a three finger  thick fluffy  white meringue . good retention spotty lacings  aroma is bright juicy tropicals  orange citrus  taste is tropical fruit salad  mouthfeel is juicy smooth creamy hop flavor but no bite  really good beer
2297,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.75,2016 vintage(i think)  a: poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a small light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing s: smells of brandy barrels with some chocolate coffee and roasted malts t: taste is chocolate and coffee up front with some brandy barrel influence. hints of roasted malts and toasted marshmallows. on the swallow theres more brandy barrel chocolate coffee and roasted malts m: this beer has a body which is lighter than anticipated and slightly silky. carbonation is quite low but it is there while the beer has a sightly drying finish due to the abv o: overall this beer is quite good. it has also held up well over time. complexity also grows as the beer warms. its definitely worth a try if you like barrel aged beers.
2298,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.9,#105 love it apple really come thru!
2299,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.26,pours black with a finger of khaki foam. head retention is good after an aggressive pour. aroma is big. apple brandy toffee barrel char and caramel dance and play over roasty and toasty malts. flavor profile is medium-thin. roasty and toasty malts lead the charge. toffee caramel molasses and apple brandy tag on for a flavorful brew. mouth feel is velvety and soft but never hits creamy. it has a medium-thick consistency. overall solid stout with hints of apple brandy coming through.  reviewed from notes. reviewed 1/12/19. 2018 version.
2300,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.5,really enjoying this. much less sweet than anticipated and has a nice chally bakers chocolage predominace. the apple brandy tastes genuine and natural whereas i feel i lot of prairies beers are try hard and artificial. namely vanilla noir which is awfully fake.  its not terribly complex. taste like a very simple basic strong old school ris with roasty notes layered with oak and yesz apple bransy. quite thick and very hot.
2301,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.79,this rating is based on the original from a few years ago. pours dark brown/black with exceptional thickness. the apple brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout. for a number of years this was my favorite beer.
2302,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.58,i have never really been a fan of the apple brandy ba stouts. the apple character has always been an odd mix for me. i got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because i love prairie and i knew people flip for this beer. upon opening it the smell is very distinct and i just dont like it! it smells the way its supposed to smell its just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. now on the tongue its a completely different story for me. the apple is there but distinct and really appealing. a tiny bit tart? the stouts sweetness works well with this barrel. it also helps for it to be a bit warmer too. a great beer that changed my mind. ive never had a beer with a smell that i didnt like end up being enjoyable before so a really fun beer.
2303,Nooner Pilsner,4.21,12 oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. look is clear light gold with a white head that falls to a thin cap. lively in the glass as carbonation races up through the body. a bit of lacing left as you sip. smell is bold as bready malt earthy spicy hops and a bit of black pepper leap out. taste is sweet bread up front then a bit of bitterness kicks in with the hop spiciness. the finish has a bit of apple/pear rind and an almost flint like character. the finish is fairly clean in the end. mouthfeel is light bodied crisp very inviting. carbonation cleans up the palate nicely. overall this is a fan favorite for a good reason. it can be as complicated of a beer as you want; drink it fast without a thought sip and contemplate the different components either way it delivers.
2304,Nooner Pilsner,3.99,look - pale straw foamy white head smell - bready peppery light fruit taste - crackery black pepper fruity malt sweetness feel - light body well carbonated crisp dry finish overall - looks like an average pilsner but the scent sets the stage for whats to come. very spicy peppery and a light fruitiness. that first sip hits with cracker black pepper and bitterness . very good bitterness. apple and malty sweetness come thru more as it warms but the peppery bitterness remains. take this one down early and pair her up with afternoon delight by starland vocal band. enjoy!
2305,Nooner Pilsner,3.72,nooner  sierra nevada brewing co. pilsner german  sierra nevada has always made a decent pilz. very traditional on point to style very crisp and clean. these beers are looked at now as easygoing sit by a pool side and relax style but that would be over simplifying this style. dig the simplicity
2306,Nooner Pilsner,3.92,poured from a 12 oz bottle into. willi becher pint glass. l - pours a clear yellow color with a white head that dissipates quickly. s - smells bready and earthy. t - tastes bitter and grassy f - medium body with an almost effervescent carbonation which slows as it sits in the glass. o - very enjoyable pilsner.
2307,Nooner Pilsner,4.13,tastes like beer to me! 12-ounce bottle into a clear solo cup. clear pale yellow white head. good head retention not much lacing because solo cup. bready and grassy with spicy and floral notes and a crisp finish that leaves lots of bitterness and a tart fruity note lingering on the palate. great pairing with spicy mexican cuisine. an outstanding and easy-drinking beer.
2308,Nooner Pilsner,4.01,crystal clear gold dense finger of foam excellent retention thin rings of lace bright herbal/spicy/floral hop nose over bready malt aroma honeyed bread with herbal/spicy flavors dry medium-light bodied could use a touch more carbonation really good pils
2309,Nooner Pilsner,3.85,pours a brilliantly bright dark gold crystal clear white bubbly head settles quickly but it leaves a nice thin film there is some minor lacing.  nose is quite hoppy get some bright citrus combine with some herbal qualities; leads me to want to say lemongrass like malt is mostly cracker like with some light grain husk character.  the taste is also nicely hoppy but too me it is not overdone...semi-sweet cracker like malt greets first tastes sort of like a mix of water cracker and ritz to me then come the hops; very grassy hay like hops; after the sip goes down the herbal nature hits in the aftertaste.  bigger side of light bodied; hops are tongue coating and then the bitterness hits moderately on the finish; this beer doesnt not finish the driest or crispiest but it still finishes quite clean for me; the drying sort of builds but it’s still has this minor lingering malt presence.
2310,Nooner Pilsner,4.04,from a 12oz bottle dated 4/14/23 into a pint glass.  pours a translucent straw color with a little more than one finger of white head. excellent retention and lacing.  big aromas of fresh cut grass flowers and black pepper.  taste follows. spicy/peppery grass. sharp tasting. bitter.  medium-bodied (for a pils). dry finish. medium carbonation. bitter aftertaste.  solid beer. would love to side-by-side this with summerfest.
2311,Nooner Pilsner,3.69,pours light yellow with a small white headsmells of grains with a light hop undertone. tastes pf grains and hops. thin mouthfeel. an okay pilsner. middle of the road for me.
2312,Abt 12,4.6,one of my personal favorites. easy to find and absolutely worth buying. ive always gotten raison fig and toffee flavors in this beer. great mouthfeel and i recommend serving at cellar temp. not too cold. pickup this legend any chance you get.
2313,Abt 12,4.96,one of my favorite beers ever! crisp dark and strong. earthy flavors with some sweet tropical notes. will make you want another — but only if you can handle it .
2314,Abt 12,4.26,served a little cool best before 12-2026. nut-brown with a dense tan head that isnt going anywhere. textbook presentation. toffee sucre candi herbal and spice elements noticeable even at fridge temperature it wasnt quite what i was expecting - has been years since ive had this before. absolutely a quality beer well-presented. warms the cockles excellent mouthfeel will get this again to review properly. suspect its rating is slightly hagiographic on this site but its definitely a wonderful beer. god bless those belgian monks!
2315,Abt 12,5,one of my favorite beers. possibly my number 1. found a large bottle at a local liquor store saving it for my birthday.
2316,Abt 12,4.84,pours a very nice deep brown with lively carbonation. wonderful aromas of dark dried fruits like sultana prune & fig with a distinct maltiness. tastes sweet and malty with notes of dried fruit sweet bready malt and perhaps a touch of chocolate amongst others. beautifully complex and perfectly balanced with a good mouthfeel. a stunning beer.
2317,Abt 12,4.74,its delicious and with 10% alcohol content whats not to like?? it has a bit of a bitter taste while drinking it but it does not last. its definitely one of my favorites now.

2320,Abt 12,5,what an absolute amazing beer! 10%vol?! you can’t taste the alcohol a dangerous yet beautiful drink to enjoy with some cured meats or with a meal. the flavour is fantastic hard to describe. mouth feel is the best i have ever experienced! the lacing is fantastic you’ll measure how many mls i took on each sip! oh have i not said? i love this beer this quadruple! bold and beautiful!
2321,Abt 12,5,not really sure how i could fault this perfect beer. the only issue i have is how expensive it is where i am!  330ml and ood was 06/26
2322,Abt 12,4.41,750ml bottle into a tulip. best before 11/1/26.  magnificent looking beer. dark brown body with a massive off white head. this is replenished by swarms of carbonation up the side of the tulip leaving gobs of lacing.  malty aroma with a lingering sweetness. also a faint funkiness.  on tasting well so smooth. abv well hidden. tons of dark fruit light sweetness. takes some restraint not to gulp it down.  mouth full finish is where the abv makes an appearance mixed with plum and raisin notes.  overall splendid beer. cracked this one tonight in celebration of west hams triumph in the europa conference final. coyi!!!
2323,Double Barrel Jesus,4.75,2015 bomber into a tulip about as pretty a beer as i’ve ever seen. pitch black with a 1-finger khaki head leaving lovely lacing.  nose is roasted malt chocolate vanilla bourbon. on the palate- more roast and much heat followed by a long oaky finish. huge body. thick and creamy. great old school big bba stout.  240th beer on the ba top 250. surprisingly hard to track down.
2324,Cappuccino Stout,3.53,dark ruby-black color roasted caramel and coffee aroma coffee plum-caramel flavor creamy smooth and full mouthfeel. nice tan clingy head leaves a nice lacing in my glass nice stout.
2325,Cappuccino Stout,3.86,black in color with minimal light penetration. there’s a half inch of creamy brown on top. the aroma is of cappuccino and dark chocolate. i’m tasting cappuccino and dark chocolate. the mouth is oily viscous and dry.
2326,Cappuccino Stout,3.84,pours a solid black body with a fluffy white head. smell is coffee a little chocolate and malt. taste is coffee milk chocolate malt touch of hop bitterness and a little sugar. medium body pretty close to a cup of cappuccino actually. overall for the price this is pretty darned good. not my favorite but price wise you could consume this more regularly so a winner.
2327,Duck Duck Gooze,4.1,fobab 2022.
2328,Duck Duck Gooze,4.55,2019 vintage  appearance: pours a cloudy apricot with a one finger head that leaves some streaky lacing as it reduces to a film  smell: tart lemon green apple white wine grape and oak layered with some barnyard funk  taste: tart lemon forward with white wine grape and green apple rounding out the lactic parade; oak and barnyard funk through the middle with a sour yogurt finish  mouthfeel: light to medium body with moderate carbonation; puckery  overall: long time want and glad to finally get a chance to taste this; lives up to its billing
2329,Duck Duck Gooze,4.55,at long last! it was always scandalous to me that the top rated gueuze on this site was from outside belgium and while i still feel this is not the best gueuze i have ever had i can now see why it is in that echelon of the style. cloudy yellow pour finger of sudsy white foam good mix of spotted and splotchy lacing. lemon sliced tart apple lacto barnyard funk white grape flowers hay and earthy oak in the potent nose. taste is just as potent but not as complex as the sour notes lead more than the barnyard funk oak backs the sour fruits well slight earth yogurt funk and decent hay round out. a more sunny disposition for the style leans sour more than funky but both present in spades but the body is light and nuanced despite the potency. i would love to age a bottle of this as i think it would age really nicely!
2330,Duck Duck Gooze,4.65,2022 vintage. side-by-side with mother of all gooze anniversary blend.  hazy golden yellow coloration. gusher on the pop frothy white carb.  nose is sweet tart funky. notes of underripe peach lemon zest and bright musty funk.  palate tart and full of stone fruit flavors. medium acid and a touch of minerality. you can tell the youth on this whereas on moag you really can tell the age on the blend.
2331,Duck Duck Gooze,4.47,received from @dimidiata. pours a bright golden color with a small amount of short-lived white head that receded to a thin ring. fully translucent almost clear. aroma has tons of funk well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted. along with lemon & dandelion. overall a wonderful smelling beer.  taste picks up right where the nose left off. i get apricots wine barrel apple vinegar lemon hay and general barnyard funk. acidity is spot on. tart but it doesnt beat you over the head allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight. light bodied bright crisp and clean.  overall an absolutely wonderful beer.
2332,The Headless Gourdsman,3.47,the headless gourdsman – from founders. four pack of 12 oz bottles. on room temperature shelf at riverside liquors grand rapids mi. acquired 13/09/23 $ 18.00 (including tax) $ 0.375/fl oz. reviewed 16/09/23 (review 3150). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. bottle stamped “bottled on: 06.29.23 1042 6”. stored at 34 degrees at home. served at 64.9 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 68.0 degrees f. appearance – 3. first pour – medium amber (srm 12) clear. body – medium amber (srm 12) clear. under direct light and when rear-lite same. head: average (maximum 4 cm aggressive center pour) beige high density. quickly reducing to a 0.35 cm regular crown and a thin complete cap. lacing – poor. a single irregular wave of small to medium bubbles remains. aroma – 3.5 – initially very weak generic spiciness. no yeast no malt no hops no barrels. no ethanol (13.5 % abv according to the label). flavor – 3.5 – begins slightly sweet with a weak maple overtone and some slight generic spiciness. no pumpkin. no yeast no malt no hops. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. slight gastric warming very smooth. alcohol is well hidden. palate – 3.5 – medium; creamy; soft carbonation. final impression and summation: 3.5 basically an alcohol delivery system easy to pound and probably not offensive to anyone.
2333,The Headless Gourdsman,4.77,2023 barrel-aged series release - 4 pack 12 oz. bottle dated 06.29.23 - 13.1% abv / ? ibu brewed and bottled in grand rapids mi poured into a bells branded tulip snifter glass  look - pours a pretty thin but fluffy off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. opaque light to dark red appearance. smell - the scent is faint and the spices are dominate. nutmeg stands out the most and cinnamon lingers in the background. taste - the bourbon is stronger in the taste and the pumpkin spices compliment it well. you also get the vanilla and oak from the barrel and the alcohol is almost nonexistent. feel - light-medium bodied with a warm mouthfeel and finishes medium dry. overall - this is a fantastic beer. the pumpkin spices blend very well with the barrel qualities and it achieves that without a predominate booziness.
2334,The Headless Gourdsman,2.95,this one pours a medium dark amber color with a small white head and a little bit of lacing.    this smells like scented candle wax dropped into aunt jemima’s syrup – it is not appealing.    i honestly had pretty high hopes for this one but they were not met in any way. this tastes like a syrupy scented candle – the maple syrup just kind of dulls any interesting character there might have been and just blankets an uninteresting bland sweetness on it. it really just does taste like a melted candle – the pumpkin and spices just feels so artificial. it’s not a pleasant beer to work through a pour of.  this is syrupy with low carbonation and just very little enticing drinkability.  this was just a huge swing and a miss for me. founders makes some great beers but this is far from one of them.
2335,The Headless Gourdsman,4.81,pours dark amber very little lacing. aroma rich with strong maple cinnamon and nutmeg notes. sweet and malty with a warm blend of fall spices. not much heat and finishes with enough bite to keep it from being too sticky. delicious dessert beer for when the weather starts turning colder!
2336,The Headless Gourdsman,4,pours a dark amber. thin foam. maple syrup aroma. very sweet brown sugar body. prominent maple flavor with a slight bitter finish. you can taste the alcohol but not too heavy. not much of a pumpkin flavor. a great fall dessert beer.
2337,The Headless Gourdsman,4,pours a dark brown color with a minimal head that disappears quickly. aroma of maple syrup and cinnamon. taste is very sweet maple with a good alcohol warmth.
2338,The Headless Gourdsman,4.12,a - deep cinnamon colored pour with dense frothy light caramel colored lacing and moderate carbonation.  s - cinnamon allspice nutmeg soome maple and bourbon.  t - bourbon and spice dominate this beer period. bourbon vanilla all spice cinnamon and nutmeg are the main spices coming through along with a sweet malt base including maple. ends on the sweeter side with a lingering bourbon and pumpkin spice on the palate.  m - thick viscous and velvety with some light prickly carbonation fighting through the thickness of the liquid. there is some warming in the back of the throat on the way down.  o - its a style you either love or hate no one seems to be on the fence. i like pumpkin beers therefore = recommended.
2339,The Headless Gourdsman,3.82,poured from a bottle into a snifter appearance – the brew pours a deep orange-amber color with a tiny head of off white foam. the head fades very fast leaving almost no lacing on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma burst with tons of roasted and toasted pumpkin paired with a good showing of spice and sweet. the sweet smells are of caramel brown sugar and maple syrup while the spice is of cinnamon nutmeg and clove. there is also a huge presence of oak and a very boozy bourbon smell. other aromas of char and smoke as well as some orange and cough medicine are there as well creating a super boozy and rich spiced pumpkin smell overall. taste – the taste starts out with a rather robust and thick syrupy roasted pumpkin taste with a decent showing of cinnamon nutmeg and clove. there is also a whole lot of doughiness and a huge amount of maple syrup and brown sugar with the alcohol is definitely not hidden. right from the start one can taste a bourbon and cough syrup alcohol taste which grows stronger as the taste advances. other flavors of oak and a touch of earth develop as the taste advances as well and with the huge alcohol and big pumpkin pie like flavors one is left with a very boozy and thick pumpkin pie strong ale like taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body is super thick and syrupy while the carbonation level is rather low. the feel pairs with the flavors and booziness quite well making for a very slow sipper indeed. overall – a little too thick and boozy for me. i was expecting something more balanced from founders and was really looking forward to a pumpkin brew but this one was a little too rich for my taste.
2340,The Headless Gourdsman,4.33,a 12 oz. bottle pours a cherry-cola colored see-through brew with a one finger off-white head that disappears quickly and zero lacing. this looks like no pumpkin ale i have ever seen before. the smell is also unique.. cinnamon ginger bourbon and other spice undercurrents. the taste is explosive! bourbon a very boozy bourbon... maple cinnamon and nutmeg. the sweetness is on the verge of overpowering. this seems more on the cusp of a very good christmas ale than a pumpkin beer. reading the back of the label founders states that no actual pumpkins were harmed in the making of this beer. i guess it is more a \pumpkin spice\ beer than a pumpkin beer. whatever it is it is a bit cloying and sticky but it tastes very good more like a manhattan than a pumpkin beer. the 13.1 abv kicks ass it\s clear like a lab created pumpkin beer and lacks the pulp present in the very best pumpkin ales... nevertheless it\s a damn good beer a damn good fall and winter beer a great \nightmare before christmas\ type beer. it\s tasty unique and reccommended.
2341,The Headless Gourdsman,3.74,poured a dark amber color with a beige head the tried but failed to cover the surface. the aroma is lost on my covid damaged nose. the taste - the first couple sips were like gas station cappuccino pumpkin spice flavor. it was really odd. after warming a bit that impression faded away and there was a relatively tasty barrel aged ale but i couldnt detect pumpkin any longer. it finished out this way. curiously one dimensional. the feel was very good for the abv nicely viscous - this is a sipping beer not a slamming beer. oa glad i got a single as im not sure i could have finished the 4 pack. not that i thought it didnt taste all right but more that its just not my cup of tea. so to speak.
2342,Dead Flowers,3.42,** 09/05/23  on tap chickies&petes.  **
2343,Dead Flowers,4.09,solid ipa looks it smells like fresh skunk weed combined with lemon zest herbs fresh cut flowers potpourri and peppery spices. it tastes like skunk weed cut off the vine mixed with grapefruit lemon zest coriander lime piney notes biscuit flowers mint papaya and fruity candy. not overly bitter but it hides the abv well.
2344,Dead Flowers,4.25,-look: beautiful hazy yellow of pure pineapple juice. -aroma: mild pineapple ripe plums slight grapefruit. -taste: pineapple juice plums mild grapefruit. -feel: soft and round tight but slippery. -overall: very good really enjoyed this!
2345,Dead Flowers,3.93,poured a pale straw color decent head and carbonation although head quickly dissipated.  the nose was wonderful and intriguing. a strong grapefruit/tart fruit smell and something i cannot quite identify maybe an evergreen forest after rain.  the taste was a bit flat it did not have that pop i have come to expect from vermont brews. there was some lime-citrus tones with decent bitterness throughout.  but overall it felt ... light. the taste had little cling and went away far too quickly for a neipa.  i did feel it would an excellent pairing with grilled white seafood scallops shrimp whitefish.
2346,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.16,deep clear ruby sweet caramel smell. the barrel and leathery notes kick in this flavor. caramel still lingers and it all feels fizzy in a pleasant way aftertaste-wise. i don’t drink too many different big beers anymore but this one’s sweet but full of bitterness that tempers. as good as i hoped it’d be.
2347,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.74,this one is almost the time of plantagenets for raul. like i imagine some fair maiden (who is more fair than others if you catch my drift) and the prince from another land together on a sultry night. the king serves prince this beer and in the morning the maid has to clean the sheets. yes this beer is exactly that.
2348,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.62,the pour is lovely - a clear rusty dark brown with solid head given the beers strength. a small ring turns into a medium one with a gentle swirl with some bubbles suspending above the beerline afterwards. the aromas start dark fruity - figs raisin and bourbon-soaked cherries but the alcohol is actually a little on the strong side and its bite brings about an overall impression of spiced rum cake.  the first sip opens as a rich tea paired with a raspberry scone. the bourbon notes tickle the outside of my palate as high tea crosses right down the middle. subsequent sips lose the anomalous tartness of the first one returning the fruit flavor to cherry from raspberry - specifically the luxardo cherries that some use for cocktail garnishes. that last note might help drive my thoughts about the beer overall.  the bourbon in noticeable and there is a bit of a warm nip from the abv of the beer. but what i really like about this beer is the dark bread i get from the malt that provides a strong backbone for the whole experience. it pairs with the the bourbon barrel notes to turn things into a rye whiskey feel. in fact double dba actually reminds me of the classic straightforward whiskey drinks - mainly a rye manhattan.  so a strong barrel influence that has the beer teetering on the edge of being not beer-like but it stays close enough for me with the tea-like flavors i associate with an esb. speaking of that i do not think this beer is categorized properly here - it should be an american strong ale and i think its a pretty good one.
2349,Double Double Barrel Ale,3.6,light brown red off white foam.  malty sorta fruity  malty but not roasty distant notes of caramel bitter but no flavor from hops. alcohol is apparent but not piercing. just needs something else.  easy to get at very light body.
2350,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.35,bottle pour - dark brown/mahogany with short foamy khaki head leaving scattered lacing and a ring of tiny bubbles. nose is mildly sweet and fragrant with hints of dark stone fruit brown sugar and barrel woody booze. taste follows with lingering alcohol creep on the finish.
2351,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.22,2012 vintage; consumed on 5/21/2022  pours a crystal-clear deep ruby hue topped with a finger and a half of fluffy off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a spotty few islands of chunky cap an expansive frothy collar and limited gobs of dense webby lacing spattered around the walls of the glass.  aroma opens to cherry cut with residual brown sugar undertones as floral hops burst forth imparting notes of amaro and light varnish into flambéed grapefruit over the middle while caramel malts meet a grassy prickle on the back end of the bouquet and musty cocoa lingers.  taste offers caramel and lighter shades of vanilla upfront with charry butterscotch finding prickly oak over the mid-palate; root beer tones emerge from a floral liqueur-laced back end wavering into a delicately boozy orange peel finish.  mouthfeel brings a medium body with a rounded moderate carbonation; almost oily/syrupy textures remain slick over the mid-palate where a quick drying results in a distant prickle leaving a noncommittal bitterness on the back end and a nearly paper-dry close.  stunningly resilient at a decade in the bottle this ale shines proudly as a successfully amplified iteration of a traditionally milder style; the firm malt backbone is expressive throughout and the floral hops are persistent and endlessly in tandem with their caramel-leaning counterpart; a polished example of quality brewing built to withstand time.
2352,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.08,bottle shared by dave. thanks man!  2014 vintage  copper crimson body with a half inch of soapy khaki-hued head. aromas of oak vanilla caramel sweet bread. this beer has developed with age akin to a strong english barleywine.
2353,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.29,vintage 2014 bottle served in a tulip glass.  appearance: semi hazy amber color with light sediment in the glass with a mahogany tint to the glass. orange tinted white head with a sticky head which initially rose roughly half a fingers length.  smell: lighter butterscotch scent. comes and goes and though great lacks that touch of potency to the nostrils.  taste: maltier than most english barleywines still retains a nice light woody finish with light feel of whiskey and light toffee.  mouth: medium carbonation but sticky beer with a mild bitter finish. i will tell you this if you can smell with your mouth theres a lot of body to the brew.  overall: good brew took my time drinking this gem and wouldnt trade it for the world. i treat classics like this they way they should. salud!
2354,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.17,2012 vintage; drank 10/10/15 @ harvest hop haus.  murky orange appearance.  minimal khaki head; minimal lace.  cream soda mild caramel & oak notes in the nose.  medium thick mouthfeel.  cream soda & oak flavors up front; caramel notes on the finish. no booze heat. smooth rich & tasty.
2355,Double Double Barrel Ale,4.43,2012 edition... poured from a bomber into a dogfish head tulip  l: hazed mahogany pour. thin fizzy white head leaves a thin rim of lacing.  s: caramel and toffee... sugars and sweets... some fruity notes.  t/f: sweet toasted grains... big time sugars... caramel and toffee... molassas and booze. vanilla... lighter fruit and coconut. warming... sticky on the tongue.  o: a big big beer... the 2012 version aged fantastically and at 7 years was still super. one to sip on a cold winter night. very solid effort.
2356,Foggier Window,4.6,pours a vibrant amber golden color with a nice head and lacing aroma has abundant tropical and citrus hints the taste follows the nose with a well balanced tropical and citrus flavor a medium bodied well carbonated beer a great iipa
2357,Foggier Window,4.6,had on tap. luminous hazy orange. just tons of citrus and tropical fruit with a touch of resin. this is an elite-level new england imperial ipa. tremendous.
2358,Foggier Window,4.46,canned 1/5/23.  l: pours an opaque deep yellow with a creamy white head that thins on top but sticks around the glass. thin irregular lacing.  s: aromas of fresh pineapple mango and peach.  t: follows the nose up front then a citrus and white grape middle. finishes dry with a touch of dankness.  f: medium mouthfeel and carbonation. a bit prickly late.  o: an outstanding synthesis of tropical/citrus/dank.
2359,Society & Solitude #5,4.9,#155 yummy!
2360,Society & Solitude #5,4.8,3 weeks old. can to wine glass.  l: pours an opaque orangeish yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. a few tiny floaters visible.  s: candied grapefruit and lemon paired with fresh pineapple and strawberries.  t: fresh grapefruit bitterness tart lemon notes and subtle sweet hints of tropical fruits white grapes and strawberries.  f: very juicy and refreshing with a medium low carbonation.  o: fantastic ipa. highly complex and perfectly balanced. best society & solitude ive had so far.
2361,Society & Solitude #5,5,draft at the farm house. hazy orange golden with two finger fluffy creamy head chunky lacing. light fruity citrusy aroma with a peppery edge. taste is like a pillow in your mouth fruity citrus floral full creamy. drinking a cloud. this is exquisite. lifetime beer. 5 stars all the way.
2362,Society & Solitude #5,4.5,picked-up a four-pack of cans at hill farmstead brewery in greensboro bend vermont for twenty dollars. my seventeenth brew from these guys. excellent liked better than # 6.
2363,Society & Solitude #5,4.5,canned 8/16/22.  l: pours a hazy gold with a short white head that slowly thins. large bubbles on the cap. the lacing is gorgeous.  s: aromas of grapefruit and pine.  t: tropical fruit up front then pink grapefruit. finishes slightly dry but not bitter.  f: medium mouthfeel. slightly less than medium carbonation.  o: the taste is a spectacular tropical/citrus fruit combo delicately balanced so that all flavors stand out but none overwhelm.
2364,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.32,12 oz bottle with a 26 october 2020 bottling date stamped on the back label.  near black body with a thin semi-durable beige head. a thin dark reddish-brown edge is visible with back lighting. this smells quite sweet i assume from the bourbon and maple syrup. it has a lightly sweet taste with a laudably balanced mix of chocolate bourbon and coffee. not surprisingly maple syrup notes are faint. relatively thick and very smooth body. well hidden abv. overall. the dessert version of kbs.
2365,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.47,poured stout black and was topped by a dense brown head of 1” in height with lots of lacing down the snifter. the aroma was strong so strong even my covid affected nose caught a wiff of the chocolate and bourbon. the taste was very well balanced for so much chocolate and rich chocolate at that. it was the star of the show but the supporting cast of coffee and dark fruits and bourbon were not lost but very present. the feel is darned near ideal for the genre just a tiny bit less “chewy” or viscous than expected. good beer if they brew it again i would drink it fresh instead of cellaring it for 3 years. but even then it is very good.
2366,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.5,03/25/23 bottle @ home
2367,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.23,bottle: poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. aroma of chocolate notes with some fudge notes and vanilla and bourbon notes are also perceptible. taste is a mix of chocolate/fudge with some maple notes and some vanilla and bourbon notes also clearly identifiable. body is pretty full with good carbonation and light warming alcohol notes. soldi ba stout with some good adjunct but it does get a little bit cloying at some point.
2368,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.18,a bottle dated 08/09/22 refrigerated since purchasing in november of the same year. poured in a kbs snifter for the review.  a vigorous pour produces a dark brown liquid churning up a small finger of tan foam. it settles very quickly to a ring around the glass. the smell is dominated by what else? mackinac fudge. a slight whiff of dark roast coffee. im not getting anything else. the taste is very much like the smell. pure fudge followed by dark roast coffee. a bit ashy tasting in the finish but nothing that detracts from the experience. the feel is medium bodied rich and smooth.  in all its pretty typical kbs in that the barrel is invisible. ditto for any maple in my opinion. ive always been a fan of kbs and appreciate its simple goodness. this one is worth your time and the price was right at $21/4 pack.
2369,Heavy Mettle,4.05,can from tfontana thanks for the opportunity! hazy murky lemon orange color with a frothy white head that dissipates. lemony grapefruity citrus with hints of mango and pineapple with a hint of pine and resin. sweet bready malt underneath and a hint of warming alcohol. far out and solid!
2370,Dos Equis Special Lager,3,12 oz can (i dont drink from green beer bottles). better than i though it would be not as good as i hoped it would be. pretty balanced overall - not too bitter or sweet just the right amount of bubbles. definitely one of the better adjuncts. high end lawn mower beer. itll definitely do when icy cold!
2371,Dos Equis Special Lager,3.08,12oz bottle. stamped on neck is best by date of bbd feb 2024. clear pale gold colored body. thin white head. leaves some lacing webs behind. aroma of caramel and corn malts. a little bit of fruity/floral hops. taste is more of the caramel/corn malts. a little bit harsh but still has the style sweetness. medium mouth feel. more of a sweet corn finish. excellent carbonation. what stands out is the balance between the harsh bite and the malt sweetness.
2372,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.58,my dad taught me to never drink beer from a green bottle. with very few exceptions i believe he was absolutely right. i wouldn’t chase a taco with this swill.
2373,Dos Equis Special Lager,4,a very sweet tasting and refreshing cerveza. the cool bottle as well as the endorsement from the world’s most interesting man also doesn’t hurt. i just wish the alc/vol was a bit higher and the cost a bit lower. it is a beer meant to be enjoyed with some enchiladas or for an afternoon at the pool.  style: mexican lager | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 4.2% | rating: 4
2374,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.76,first off cap was extremely hard to get off without a bottle opener for no reason. not totally disgusting feels a little watery. recommend drinking cold. overall decent wouldnt go out of my way to buy it again.
2375,Dos Equis Special Lager,3.03,unremarkable tho ok; its a slightly different light lager- a bit of semi-sweet/semi-malty taste - but lacking in carbonation and body.
2376,Dos Equis Special Lager,4.65,large white head that dissipates slowly. not much lacing. the beer is a light golden color. not yellow. very clear. active carbonation.  pleasant aroma. yeast and sweet malt. smells like bread baking in the oven. a little bit of hops.  tastes light and refreshing. not harsh at all. very smooth. light body but not too light or thin. sweet. tastes just like it smells. smooth mild malts. very slight toasted character to the malt. no hop bitterness. but a balanced slightly dry finish. tastes good. light but good. dont taste much in the way of adjunct. tastes like a light but decent quality lager. reminiscent of session red lager but lighter. little bit of dry corn taste to the finish. overall taste is good. much better than the vast majority of adjunct lagers.  lots of carbonation. but still soft and pleasant in the mouth. very satisfying to drink this beer. goes down smooth and easy.  this is a premium adjunct lager. similar to what pbr used to be back in the day. i really enjoy drinking this beer. just wish it was cheaper. beer got so damn expensive. its a damn shame. but this is a nice old school lager beer. good quality. great drinkability. hard not to like this. its a really good beer.
2377,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.25,pretty standard aal maybe even a bit thin for the style. i wouldn’t call it “piss” because it lacks even offensive qualities. and i’m not hating on it— these beers have their place and can be rightfully enjoyed as any other. in terms of import lagers i’d take a modelo or corona over this.
2378,Dos Equis Special Lager,3.18,drank from a 24oz can. scent is funky with a little malt and sweaty socks. taste is wet paper and malt with some skunk. super easy to drink. some lime really wakes this one up. a decent beer to drink a couple of with some mexican food.
2379,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,4.9,# 135 yum yum!
2380,Flora Plum,4.52,solid beer - a bit plum tart aftertaste.
2381,Flora Plum,4.76,original bottling  it is a clear reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. it looks less thick than many of the hf saisons i have tried but prettier.  tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. as i pour it gets even stronger. my salivary glands fire before i even put nose to glass. such a delicious aroma it calls entices with fresh plum tart sourdough raspberry jam grape must notes honeysuckle hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.  all the flavors of the nose are here no need to repeat them balanced perfectly in a wonderful blend. it ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart fruity linger. as it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix quite lightly and it gets even better.  medium body for style light carbonation which works well here clean as a whistle with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.  another masterpiece from the master i regret not tasting fresh. it has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment
2382,Flora Plum,4.74,after flora pear this is my favorite flora. excellent barrel character has been imparted into the beer. pours a beautiful deep gold big wine nose effervescent with plums dancing in the background. fantastic.
2383,Flora Plum,4.51,pours a straw gold. nose of plum lemon hay and traditional hf nose. taste follows with a well blended plum lemon hay minimal acid. feel is light/medium with medium carb. overall this is an excellent fruit beer that is well balanced with the base beer.
2384,Oktoberfest Weissbier,3.99,nice flavorful oktoberfest. maltapplebread and grain. overall definitely worth trying
2385,Oktoberfest Weissbier,4.16,an exceptional oktoberfest...  great looking beer for the style the smell was malty with bready notes and a hint of spice. mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a slight twinge of astringentness. the taste was everything i expect in an oktoberfest - pretty much everything that met my nose. enjoyed this immensely and will go at it again before this season is over.
2386,Oktoberfest Weissbier,3.54,500ml can. stamp on bottom reads 04.05.2023 for canning date and 04.05.2024 for best by date. unfiltered pale gold colored body. three fingers of white head upon pouring and this sticks around as a thin cap. leaves behind strings of lacing. aroma is toasted malts and green apple. taste is wheat malt caramel and fruity hops. quite sweet. aftertaste is very bread-like. medium mouth feel. slightly creamy texture. very good carbonation. reminds me of an apple covered in caramel.
2387,Oktoberfest Weissbier,3.71,pours lovely. hazy and gold and inviting. decent fluffy head. bread and biscuit with something sweet on the nose. taste follows chewy but not massive bodied. nicely balanced feel. very popular festbier and i can see why.
2388,Oktoberfest Weissbier,4.02,suprised the reviews aren\t a bit better...i think this is a high quality fest bier by an historic brewer .... it was likely the number one seller at our local octoberfest .... a bit lighter and sweeter than you might expect but still pretty yummy
2389,Oktoberfest Weissbier,3.53,from the 0.5 l can in a snifter. this fest pours a clear amber tinged golden color with a fantastic head of white foam that settles to a thick ring thin layer and sport some nice lacing. nose of soft wheat biscuit and subtle caramel. flavors follow the nose with biscuit caramel and a heavy grain bill that is assertive with light herbal hop notes. mouth feel is medium medium light carbonation and a grain and subtle sweet caramel finish.  overall----decent but had a lot better. also seems to depend on the year when it comes to these and this year is not erdingers year.
2390,Oktoberfest Weissbier,3.27,4pk of 0.5l cans (prd: 04 05 2023 bbd: 04 05 2024) fm arundel preserve wine & spirits hanover md: i was looking to try something different and the price was appealing ($10) so...  wow! that is a lot of pillowy white head atop a cloudy light-yellow body. a whiff of something...biscuity? mellow fruit & bread flavors. a bit of prickly carbonation. somewhere between a marzen (+) & a festbier (-). not in a hurry to return to but happy to have tried - especially at that price.
2391,Oktoberfest Weissbier,4.21,i purchased this at my local sore as a 4 pack of 16.9 oz cans. brewed on 4/9/23 and good until 4/9/24. this is a very interesting beer. a cross between a hefeweizen and a marzen. the color is very hazy for the style. it pours a nice head that sticks around for a long time. its light and flavorful. an excellent relaxing on the porch beer. a definite buy again.
2392,Oktoberfest Weissbier,3.36,11.2 fl oz. bottle best before 04/2023. acquired a single bottle of this stuff as part of a mixed six pack at the local binnys; clearing out the last of this years oktoberfest beers. this one classified as a festbier / wiesenbier here on the site and apparently my first beer from erdinger.  poured to camp crystal lake stemless wine snifter. cloudy golden orange body big finger of frothy soapy white head that leaves good fluffy lacing. looks pretty good though lighter in color than our traditional american oktoberfests. dusty grainy & malty. slight orchard fruits - green apple / pear but very much in the background. notes of lager yeast grain / wheat / corn. subtle indistinct yeast-derived spice. slight fumes / phenols. taste isn\t harsh or offensive but not nearly as brown or complex as i\d hoped especially when i see this beer mostly marketed as an oktoberfest. bready but grainy and wheaty. flavors of corn grain husk & wet cardboard bring to mind cheaply made adjunct laden swill. slight hint towards belgian flavored yeast - notes of banana & pepper are apparent. body is smooth & crisp - well carbonated slightly filling and bloating; call it medium-bodied. overall it isn\t bad beer by any means just not very good either. super average and lacking in distinctive oktoberfest characteristics in my opinion. even as a festbier maybe being a beer you might want to drink a lot of -- this beer isn\t it. would try others from this brewery. cheers.  erdinger oktoberfest weissbier -----3.25/5
2393,Oktoberfest Weissbier,3.86,translucent gold with moderate white head.  smells of sweet toasted grain  biscuit dough and light floral and fruity aromas. almost as if it were a hefe+helles blend.  taste is medium-light crackery malt a mild blend of vague fruity flavors [apple+pear+plum?]  some spiciness[coriander+black pepper+ clove & thankfully very light on the clove :)]  finishing with something akin to sourdough bread though stronger in flavor intensity and not exactly that.  feel is light-medium with moderate  medium-coarse  somewhat prickly carbonation that gives a light burn at the back of the throat.  overall fairly enjoyable though a not top-of-my-list festbier. a nice change-of-pace while going through all of the other oktos.
2394,Modelo Especial,3.27,look...copper but closer to gold with a quickly dissolving white head. completely clear smell...the lightest of hints of the hop citrus and wheat. a wave of fresh grass taste...reminiscent to me of a german pils but a little bit maltier and not as dry on the finish. a pillow like resolve at the end with some sweetness. feel..smooth and thin with a proper amount of carbonation giving an easy drinking overall...i would not buy this too many times a year but i dont buy many non craft pilsners at all soo...it is great on a hot day and some good eats . great vacation beer or staycation . i gotta be honest these are cooler dwellers from vaca....so gifted cheers
2395,Modelo Especial,3.61,this is the best beer you can buy at 7-eleven. it has a decent amber color and it tastes good. like beer. its fairly smooth without an unpleasant aftertaste. its a step above your average adjunct lager. when im tired of the heaviness of stouts and the bitterness of ipas i enjoy a glass of this beer. it reminds me of when i was young having a beer with my dad or drinking with my friends.
2396,Modelo Especial,3,appearance & taste is according to style with a slight metallic flavor. overall it tastes pretty good for the style
2397,Modelo Especial,3.46,look: crystal clear dark yellow and my pour kicks off a tornado in the glass that doesn’t stop and helps build a great head that settles to a lid leaving decent lacing behind aroma: cereal grains floral hops soda crackers some pilsner malt and a little lightstruck skunk note taste: grains pilsner malt and crackers join forces on the initial hit and are quickly followed by stronger-than-expected floral hop notes. malt and hops trade off throughout the middle and on the close floral hops finish on top mouthfeel: light but not too watery clean medium-high carbonation and crisp and clean on the finish overall: i dig it. outside of victoria and negra modelo this is my favorite mexican chela and top dog if i’m going for the pilsner-esque style of mexican lager. more flavorful than others to me and a good floral hops presence for a macro keep me coming back whenever the calling comes – evening bbq work party fishing camping hot weather chilling etc. fun to slow down and finally review it
2398,Modelo Especial,3.75,12oz bottle duvel tulip best by september 2023.  well well well the most popular beer in america. it does look nice; middle gold with a decent white head.  corn sweetness faint grain husk and surprisingly i do get the orange blossom honey. a little alcohol too.  very neutral grain honey-corn sweetness light herbal bitterness.  moderate body and carbonation.  it’s definitely a macro lager though it’s got more flavor and body than say bud light. i’ve rated it to style not my preferences.
2399,Modelo Especial,2.95,i am rating this for the style. the style being an american/mexican regular type lager beer. this beer is more dry than i\d like. it isn\t special at all. it\s smells like beer but sorta in a bad way. like what i remember beer to smell like when i was in college. i\d definitely drink this if it was offered to me. however i don\t think i will be buying it again because i prefer other beers from similar companies. nothing wrong with this beer it\s just a bit dry and the flavor is of corn and raw dough.
2400,Modelo Especial,3.4,pours very light straw color crystal clear quick bubbly white head forms and then just as quick as it came it is gone there is minimal retention; just some white splotches here and there and a translucent ring; eventually these too fade to nothing.  nose interesting to me combination of an astringent like sweetness some mineral or metallic character stale white bread touch of hops.  taste is lightly creamy and sweet watered down with some slight metallic character on the fnish; there is a noticeable generic hop presence that shows itself more in feel that taste.  light body nicely effervescent and actually quite smooth and easy to drink mild sweetness low bitterness; dry but as stated above a little lingering sweet remains.
2401,Frio Light,2.12,12 oz. can poured into imperial pint class look: light straw color no head development no lacing minimum carbonation smell: malty nothing else taste: slight sourness not much malt feels kinda metallic expected watered down flavor feel: no much mouthfeel about a half-second of bubble alcoholic finish overall: nothing stands out about this beer other than the 75 cents i paid in the discount shelf. will not get again. pair with well i would suggest foods for a light lager but since i dont want to drink this i would not pair food with it.
2402,Frio Light,2.03,pours piss pale yellow with a decent two-finger white head that fades from the glass quickly. smells of hay barn corn funk faint sweet grain maltiness. taste is mainly corn not a lot of flavor going on since it is a light lager. light-bodied high carbonation smooth crisp & oh so crushable... if your goal is getting tossed on the frio river drinking copious amounts of light lager & forgetting where you are; then this beer is most certainly on your menu.
2403,Frio Light,1.4,looks slightly darker gold than i expected. not that it’s dark or anything close to it. there’s an unpleasant aroma like wet cardboard and rotten wood. the taste is not much better. i can’t really say it’s any worse than the uber popular mu. it has this weird grape koolaide flavor that is not something i want in a beer. it tastes like mineral water and cardboard there’s no distinct hop or malt profile i can detect. that being said i’m not planning on drinking them by themselves. i use cheap beers like this to mix micheladas with. it’s actually pretty good for that purpose otherwise it’s undrinkable.
2404,Frio Light,2.65,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance- the beer pours a straw color with a small white head that fades very fast to leave almost no lace on the sides of the glass. smell - the aroma is of a off corny and cardboard smell mixed a little bit of light cracker smell. taste-the taste begins with a off light cracker malt and a bit of a cardboard taste that gets stronger as the taste advances. toward the end of the taste an off metallic taste and some hay comes to the tongue and leaves one with a off taste to linger on the tongue mouthfeel- the body of the brew is light and the feel is very light. for the style the feel is good and makes for a quick sipper. overall - ahh.. not too special here..
2405,Frio Light,2.95,ive been famialir with this brew since it s inception being carried e at our local heb stores here in so. cntrl. tx.  when frio light first hit the shelves here i bought a six pack of 16oz. of it and it was amazing-it tasted like a poor mans belgain triple! not too long after that i bought another 6 pack and it was flat out putrid and undrinkable. they seem to have stabilized the quality control of int to where it is generally a disagreeable pretty poor swill...that said i really am of the firm opinion that qc  or more precisely the lack of qcis integral how this beer may present at any given point in time...i mean with the more expensive american adjunct lagers you get precise consistent product. case in point i just bought a 30 pack of this frio light and it presented as a interesting aal akin to a pabst or maybe the dregs of the barrels of some very good beer? all that said i think  and i am of the opinion that when the beer travels all the way from where it is brewed in memphis tennessee by quality brewers( that.s what the can says despite being said in the headliner of review page it is made in wisconsin by  city brewing) in hot truck (broiling hot actually in the summer) it can and will ruin the beer. maybe tha\s why the stuff i just bought here in december tastes pretty good in fact i rate it a solid 3 right now.
2406,Frio Light,2.77,so this is a good cheap beer running about $20 for a 30 in texas. tastes very similar the coors light and is a good going to a party budget buy. i have converted many to drinking this as their daily buy and they have a 6.0 option thats a little stronger but still good. all around a good beer for those that dont want to spend $10+ a bottle for micro brew.
2407,Frio Light,1.54,appearance: pours to thin head that laces a bit. pale clear straw color.  aroma: smells of sweet syrup candy corn overripe pears and apples and a hint of solvent. very cheap smelling.  flavor: flavor is just plain off-- candylike and not very much like a real beer. almost like a non-alcoholic brew except you can detect the alcohol through the thin veil. tastes of chemicals. aftertaste liuke cheap waxy candy or artificial sweetner. yuck.  mouthfeel: light and bubbly. moderate co2 (about 2.5 volumes). no astringency. watery but quenching.  overall: tastes weird not enjoyable. even at the rock bottom low price point it is pointless.
2408,Frio Light,2.81,poured into a nonic pint glass.  looks like a classic cartoonish beer with huge white sudsy head and clear golden body. smells like damp corn husk cardboard. tastes fairly neutral with a little bit of corn adjunct and slight metallicism. mouthfeel is light and fluid.  overall not spit-out bad just plain and watery but not in a good way. if i want plain and watery in a good way i’ll drink natty light.
2409,Frio Light,3.08,i received this can from my local in-person trader tone77 who always come through with unexpected and surprising additions for the canquest (tm)! this is just one more excanple of his ability to suss out new canned beers.  from the can: american brewed; 92 calories/2.8 carbs; premium pilsner brewed and canned by quality brewers memphis tn.  i got some foaming through the vent when i initially crack!ed it open so i quickly canmenced a glug into the awaiting glass. unbidden it formed just under three fingers of foamy fizzy rocky bone-white head with very limited retention quickly falling to wisps & leaving only a trace of lacing behind. color was straw-yellow (srm = > 2 < 4) with ne-quality clarity. nose had an odd maltiness not of an adjunct like corn but instead almost like wheat slightly honeyed. hmm. i have smelled much worse in/from the style. remember to review to style not to taste! mouthfeel was thin & watery about par for the course. the taste was really bland barely registering as anything more than fizzy water. the site\s style guidelines read: the hop character is low and should only balance with no signs of flavor or aroma. agreed. it was pretty close to flavorless but the smell was at least noticeable. it would be hard to rate it as poor in that case. finish was quite dry & refreshing but it was a decent beer in a crappy style. i suppose that it would be nice on a hot humid summer\s day but then again so would a glass of water. ymmv.
2410,Frio Light,1.38,poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. the appearance is a crystal clear pale light yellow with an almost non-existent head. the aroma is basically tap water. the taste mirros the nose. it doesnt taste bad but it doesnt taste like a regular beer. more like a flavored water or near beer.
2411,Frio Light,1.2,imagine pouring 6 ounces of miller lite into a glass with 6 ounces of water and you have frio light.
2412,Frio Light,2.39,poured from a 12 oz. can. has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is very light hints of corn. taste is nowhere to be found. maybe the lightest grains not much beer flavor at all. feels light in the mouth and overall it just doesn\t feel like i drank a beer.
2413,Frio Light,1.2,worst beer in the world
2414,Kokanee,2.68,one of my favorites if i have to run with an aal though im not sure its any different from the bmcs and pabst is probably a bit better. refreshing smooth clear drinkable pretty clean easy finish. i tend to overrate this one because im usually sampling while on a raft or boat and the atmosphere adds to the enjoyment...
2415,Kokanee,3.63,on tap at the wood in canmore alberta into a sasquatch kokanee glass.  this one pours a clean golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this doesn’t smell like a whole lot really – some grassiness and grain but that it’s.  this is definitely better than any labatt that we get in the states and i had it on a beautiful patio facing the rocky mountains. so it tasted great but that’s mostly a situational thing. it’s quite light with no real flaws to it but also no real distinct flavor notes to pull out other than the cold crispness. the lack of flaws in a light mass-produced lager is something to note though.  this is crisp clean and very drinkable.  i really liked this one but that is more because i was on a trip for banff national park and almost anything would have tasted pretty good.
2416,Kokanee,2.84,the a-b usa version purchased in oregon. rated to style (which i like) and consumed straight from the bottle. 10-15 years ago the bc version had an incredible lightness of being that made up for its lack of flavor because it seemed to be brewed with helium. kokanee had a truly unique feel back then. this 12-pack is likely brewed in fairfield ca and is a kinda interesting take on budweiser. completely neutral on smell. mild beer aftertaste after the carbonation fades. its a lighter bud that omits some of the beery notes of budweiser but at the expense of the traces of complexity that still exist in the king of beers. going down it has the same swallow taste/mouthfeel of bud that reminds of jangling coins in your pocket. if you like bud this is decent but its taste is an abbreviated one-note bud. this could be bud: the next generation. at least its still in bottles and better than the current rolling rock.
2417,Kokanee,2.75,one of the better pale lagers i’ve tried cereal in nature but smooth and mild and tastes really good. surprised but pleasantly so. cereal grains mainly in aroma and taste mouthfeel is light but not watery. refreshing and easy to drink.
2418,Kokanee,3.26,340ml bottle wow! i haven’t had this one in about 20 years! l: crystal clear pale golden body fizzy white head fades to a thin layer of foam s: light biscuity grain grassy hops t: taste of nostalgia! lightly toasted grain cereal grain honey mild grassy hops f: light bodied moderate carbonation crisp and not overly sweet finish o: to me a 4 and higher means i’d buy it again…based on nostalgic value this is easily a 4 for me
2419,Kokanee,2.57,the cans are excellent for shotguns. unfortunately shotguns is what this beer is best for. best served out the side of the can. half a litre ice/1
2420,Kokanee,2.82,six pack of pint cans picked up at total wine in bellevue washington. no dating just a code. served in a pint glass.  look- clear watery gold hay color. a decent off-white head that recedes quickly to a thin cap of foam almost no lacing. moderate carbonation streams visible.  smell- corn and light cereal grain light grass no real hop aroma.  taste- same as the smell really watered down and mundane.  feel- light bodied with a decent somewhat crisp lightly corn sweet finish. medium carbonation on the tongue.  o- i used to drink this years ago and its really gone down hill. dont bother with this one waste of money.
2421,Kokanee,2.53,we drink alot of this in canada and its a constant head of debate weither kokannee or bud light is better. the honest truth is theyre both trash but theyre easy drinkin. theres only one way to drink kokanee and thats ice fucking cold straight out of some ice and fast enough she dont warm up. if you drive a lifted truck and you dont drink kokanee or bud light what are you even doing. kokanee is the pepsi of the beer world and everyone knows it.
2422,Kokanee,3.79,clear gold with three fingers of white head. smell is fruity and grainy. taste is grainy with some light hop bitterness. mouthfeel is light with strong carbonation. overall a tasty and light easy drinking lager.
2423,Kokanee,2.89,clear golden body; lively carbonation; fair one-finger thick head; sheets of foam left along the glass. cracker-like aroma. the taste mimics the aroma with some additional light hop presence; a bit of metallic flavor at the end. light body; crisp with a hint of sweetness.  a passable if definitely blasé beer.
2424,Kokanee,1.29,an absolute mess and travesty. regardless of being canadian beer it goes down like water (probably tastes better on tap [if you can find it on tap]). there is absolutely no feel to this beer im extremely interested into how the hell this sells; perhaps an acquired taste of garbage is required. a disheveled beer that isnt worth anyones pallet.
2425,Bravo,4.5,a: poured into a snifter to a deep brown beer thats slightly amber around the edges. the beer is topped by a dense and slightly rocky finger and a half of off white head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing s: smells of caramel and brown sugar with some hints of barrel and faded oily hops. t: taste is caramel some oak and woodspice hints of citrus and pine from the hops a touch of vanilla and some brown sugar sweetness. on the finish theres more oily citrus and pine with some lingering oak caramel and brown sugar. m: this beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. carbonation is slightly effervescent and adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish due to the abv. o: overall this is a really good beer. great flavors and decent complexity that also stands up well to some age.
2426,Bravo,4.83,consumed in 2023. quite a revelation in a field of mild brown ales. nothing mild here. brown liquid with a sturdy beige head. oak and bourbon come through in delightful waves but never too much. bourbon strength is balanced with a fig and chocolate sweetness creating a beer that evolves throughout the taste leaving a deep luxurious finish. work of art here.
2427,Bravo,4.63,more barrel aged barley wine than brown ale but regardless of how you classify this beer it’s is a tasty beer. very well done with the barrel aging moderated but strong. a beautiful clear amber brown. warming smooth and a hint of sweetness.
2428,Bravo,4.3,august 2022: poured an opaque brown with a small light brown collar [fridge temp]  aroma of prunes molasses bread wood bourbon with some alcohol notes.  taste of of dark bread prunes chocolate figs fudge vanilla. some winey taste in there too. definitely evolved as it warmed. got better and better [or that could be the alcohol talking]  mouthfeel was somewhat heavy on the tongue  overall very nice especially given its age. held up well over the years. the beer reminded me of a warm blanket sitting in front of a fire. nice.
2429,Bud Light,3.15,look...pale copper closer to yellow. white fizzy rapidly dissipating head smell...light hint of hop and grass and light citrus. grain corn taste...a sweet note after the bitter start melting to a sweet drying losing its carb a little making it easy to swallow. a light pilsner taste to me never cloying sweet. feel...thin as expected in a light pils or helles lager...fuller to me than expected overall...this was a gift and would probably never buy on its own. not that it is bad but i have been buying beers for 30 years and this one i am sure i have never purchased but that is me...haha. so many other options that i prefer but overall not a bad beer. i have had plenty worse than this and were allegedly made better
2430,Bud Light,3.66,i drink lower alcohol beers now and this is that. overall crisp and refreshing. price is right.
2431,Bud Light,2.24,on tap pours a light gold colour with some faint grainy smells. taste is a watery beer taste that does not improve. bud heavy us much better throw a few olives in to make it palatable.
2432,Bud Light,1,the original piss water.
2433,Bud Light,1,awful
2434,Bud Light,3.8,on a hot summers day nothing goes better than a bud light. at 7.99 a 12 pack bottles…what’s to complain about. oh yeah it’s woke. who cares! drink up
2435,Bud Light,1.05,crap in a can
2436,Max,2.52,from a can purchased in seoul. golden color with white head. sweet grain smell. light body. tastes like it smells sweet grain with some corn and earthiness. below average but drinkable enough. makes me think the other reviews are a freshness issue.
2437,Max,2.35,it was an average malty beer very refreshing yet nothing to special about it. over all 2.25
2438,Max,1.06,i got max at the korean air lounge in the incheon international airport.  it was from a machine where you place the glass and it tilts and pours for you. the color was a urine-yellow and the head almost felt coarse. the whole time i was drinking max i felt like i was drinking metal. there was an overarching metallic smell and flavor that took away everything else from a forgettable experience.
2439,Max,1.89,11.13(?)oz bottle purchased at the north spokane total wine for a price i forget. i purchased this solely as a ticker beer as i\d never had a korean beer before. i didn\t notice the 04032013 stamp until today so this beer is definitely past it\s prime (and once again way to go re: freshness total wine).  poured into a jever pilsener glass this was a chill-hazed slightly amberish golden color with a miniscule white head that receeded to a thin collar in seconds. despite the lack of head theres lots and lots of bubbles arcing skyward. no lace at all.  big crude grainy aroma and hints of white wine so 50% what i expected and 50% wtf.  grainy malts with a side of diacetyl. yum...  light bodied but not as light as it should be. lousily low level of carbonation.  pretty awful in part due to age no doubt but i dont think there was much chance of anything commendable even if fresh. oh well im a little closer to my dorky goal of having at least one beer from every brewing country on earth.
2440,Max,3,smooth low on flavor but smooth. a good example of an aal.
2441,Olde English 800,2.8,the taste of my childhood so theres that. for what it is its amazing theres no possible way you could finish the warm backwash in that 40oz!!
2442,Olde English 800,2.7,bang for your buck. highly recommend.
2443,Olde English 800,2.15,man i don’t know where to begin. this product tastes horrible and is an extremely difficult chug. my olde english product was unfortunately expired which could have caused the horrible metal like after taste. would only recommend if you have 4 dollars lying around looking for a good time.
2444,Olde English 800,3.28,a - perfectly clear medium gold with light carbonation.  s - big sweet corn grain malt aroma with some malt sweetness.  t - corn grain sweetness that finmishes on the sweeter side.  m - light medium body.  o - not as terrible as the overall score suggests. not great but not terrible.
2445,Olde English 800,2.87,42oz plastic bottle best by july 31st 2023  on the pour a surprisingly springy white 3 finger head formed with surprisingly decent retention with a slow recession to a rocky slightly foamy appearance. body is highly carbonated and a golden straw. almost laces but not quite.  aroma is immediately skunky but present classic american and or noble hops. a bit of a metallic aroma backs the skunk somewhat pleasantly? surprisingly light aroma.  flavor is sweet and bready woth a touch of that skunky hop still present. arguably almost syrupy sweet but not a bad beer. actually quite smooth and soft with an almost nutty malt character.  feel is very full. again verging on if not full blown syrupy.  overall this was a pleasant surprise. ive had a very expired oe before and it was terrible. this much fresher 2nd go round is much more pleasant and drinkable. a bit too sweet though.
2446,Olde English 800,2.42,pours out of the can a crystal clear gold with minimal head. smells slightly sweet and grainy. taste follows the nose while being relatively thin. its not bad but not the most prolific malt beverage.
2447,Olde English 800,4.12,was able to have a beer of every style in 2022 so decided to end the year with class. poured a clear golden dark yellow with 1.5 head with good retention and minimal lacing. nose was sweet corn and a bit of grain; no boozy or harsh notes. taste followed with lightly sweet corn and malt with enough bitterness to keep it from cloying. mouthfeel had moderate weight and was rather crisp. a great example of the style and easy to get down in bulk.
2448,Olde English 800,2.93,cant believe i have not reviewed this until now the stronger version at 7.5% abv out of the clear plastic 42 ounce screw top bottle to kick off our holiday bottle share nice bring! i am immediately surprised at how this really isnt that bad its got some body some actual malt character and doesnt present as cheap as it actually is. golden honey colored super excited frothy cream white head with nice wispy retention and visibly high carbonation nice clarity too looks just fine. the nose and somewhat subtle when this is cold and thats how its best falls apart a little at temperature but cold its kind of brisk a little nutty and sweet only faintly metallic no yeast or hops at all but kind of clean baked and bready. the flavor is a little worse but when its cold i swear its not bad its when it warms up a little that it gets sweet and heavy and weirdly alcoholic and a touch astringent too sweet most of the way a little corny or otherwise adjuncty but there is decent pale barley malt in this too i am sure of it. i even get some minerals before the finish. i dont hate this i know i should but i dont and in the context of a bunch of wild saisons and heavy stouts i came back to this one a few times. the mouthfeel is both hearty and refreshing at the same time and the value of this is off the charts. far better than its ratings and objectively better than most of its peers!
2449,Olde English 800,1,i am a big believer that you have to experience something before you have the right to comment. this usually applies to movies. for whatever reason after seeing crushed cans of old english littering sidewalks for years and dismissing the sight as why would anyone drink that i decided i had to man up and try it. so i took my $1.99 and bought a 24 ounce can. wow. in some ways it was more sad than bad. i understand that in the past 5.9 abv was a big deal and dudes just purchased it to get their drunk on but nowadays thats considered lightweight. okay those beers likely cost more than $1.99. there nothing there taste wise. it wasnt horrible. it wasnt anything but a slight-very slight hint of fruitiness. bland burger. sad. i regret it all.
2450,Olde English 800,2.85,dark gold amber looking color. had 1 finger of white head on the pour and quickly lost half that. looks like the half left is slowly dropping as i type. lazy streaming carbonation visible.  nose is a touch sweet. grain smell on the nose comes through. like corn grain.  the mouth is sweet and a bit of a malt like flavor. seems simple on the taste lets put the two together now we have sweet malts. is it overly sweet? no.  mouth feel starts as a bit medium and finishes surprisingly well. a touch of lingering sweet malt and yes there is the grain on the back of the mouth that sits there for a minute.  i am in las vegas nv and was able to get the 7.5% abv version and i did chill the crap out of the 24 oz. can before i cracked it. i think if this higher abv (higher than the 5.9% abv version) were to get warmed up it may have that malt liquor taste i find unpleasant. kind of that i am trying to be a lager why the shit did they add this fructose syrup to spoil me? type of thing. if this were to warm up and had a sweeter taste were to come out i would say no way. i will say i have had much worse malt liquor beers for sure. still searching for my final opinion. the one thing i do not like is i find myself trying to drink it before it warms. and today is a warm day even though i am inside.. o.k. maybe that is what this is for fast slam hopefully quick buzz on a cheap beer kind of a four loko beer thing. enough rambling. how about will i buy it again? the higher abv warming does come through a bit towards the end as i try to chase a chilled product. buy it again is still a questionable thought. i really do not think i would try this again unless i could get the lower abv. more along the lines of an icehouse beer. yet there may be a fit for this with some heavy meats on a good bbq day. damn now i am just hungry? this has been an exhausting push and pull beer review. i really look forward to more people trying the higher gravity and seeing what they think. i think at 5.9% and being cheap again around the icehouse region this might work. i know people look for the higher gravity one yet now i seek the lower gravity one. so sorry for the ramble ladies and gents cheers!
2451,Olde English 800,4,malt liquor or adjunct lager is a mass produced cheap quality beer. everyone who has consumed gas station beer is aware. oe800 is the king of malt liquor as they claim. i relocated to a large metropolitan area from a small rural community so i never even saw oe800. i lived here for almost 6 months before i actually bought a tall boy. i was pleasantly surprised. literally the best malt liquor i have ever consumed. very similar to bud and bud is not that good when compared to craft lager. a sale price with sales tax included of $1.39 is a decent value.
2452,Olde English 800,1.57,first time ever that i\ve tried this beer even though it\s been around for so long. way back when way before the beer craze began this was the big go to beer for certain groups of people and it was probably because of the abv. anyway i digress. finally tried this and i was really sorry i did. blehh. terrible beer.
2453,Olde English 800,2.82,ahh miss tha good ol days with tha glass 40s of old e damn times changed.
2454,Dale's Pale Ale,3.77,hazy dirty gold pour in a good way! fluffy white head. subtle hoppy aromas with slight citrus notes. taste follows with stronger lemon zestiness. nice dry finish. good stuff.
2455,Dale's Pale Ale,5,not sure you can improve upon this gem. will mix with the vape tricks out of curiosity. smells malty or is it hoppy? always unique. dig it.
2456,Dale's Pale Ale,4.04,a: a nice mahogany and dark copper color with some golden amber notes. 2 finger frothy tan head  s: bitter citrus and tangy oranges. grapefruit and a faint earthy floral note. noticeable caramel note. not too complex but really nice smelling the sharpness makes the mouth water  t: follows the nose. caramel and crusty bread immediately followed by grapefruit. some orange zest and piney resin.  m: solid medium mouthfeel with low-medium carbonation  o: old school pale ale right here. earthy hoppy along with some malts. nothing wrong with this at all its a great drinking beer
2457,Dale's Pale Ale,2.32,not a fan personally.
2458,Dale's Pale Ale,3.37,acclimated to 50°f and poured into an american pint glass.  pours a clear dark dark gold maybe bronze with a 2 finger foamy lasting white head with heavy and sturdy lacing.  whiffs of hop and marijuana while looking. initial aroma is lightly hoppy with a slight marijuana/skunk presence. smells slightly watery or diluted with notes of grapefruit pith/rind. smells almost sanitary somehow? the marijuana note and diluted feeling fade after smelling a while and the grapefruit becomes stronger. after agitating the hops become stronger.  initial taste before swallowing is sweet bitter and slightly dank with grapefruit rind and caramel like maltiness. after swallowing the grapefruit rind becomes a full on grapefruit oil taste that lasts into the aftertaste along with the sweet maltiness sitting on the middle top and sides of the tongue. the hops manifest on the swallow bright and dry. a black pepper kick is revealed in the roof of the mouth in the late aftertaste and a vague pine taste can be found throughout. the bitterness builds as i drink. it felt to me as though the flavors were were a little disjointed though thats likely entirely personal preference they worked alright.  mouthfeel is slightly creamy and smooth which is enjoyable. it goes down easy sort of crashing around the mouth.  i dont think ill buy again honestly. it was honestly good i just dont love it overall. decent price though so maybe!
2459,Dale's Pale Ale,4.57,beer much better than the average rating on here. my opinion is that most beer advocate reviews correlate with price. this is a reasonable priced beer so you can expect that the experts on here will rate it accordingly
2460,Dale's Pale Ale,4.02,look - deep gold big sudsy white head with staying power good lacing left behind smell - woody earthy hops floral malty taste - sweet malty floral citrus pine sappy aftertaste feel - medium light body low carbonation pine resinous finish overall - wow! i remember the first time i had this and today i have the same thought. cant believe this is a pale ale. it drinks like a west coast ipa with the pine sappy aftertaste and pine resinous finish. i know theres thousands of options out there today but dont sleep on this one. pick it up if youve never tried it or pick it up again if you have. dales is a classic tasty brew that i will enjoy again and again. pairs up nicely with back for more by ratt.
2461,Dale's Pale Ale,3.82,picked up some of these on st. patricks day to try for half & halfs. decided to try one again today on its own.  l: pours a rich copper with a 3 finger almost creamy beige head with excellent retention. leaves nice lacing and when the head finally dissipates it leaves a thick beige cap. a little dark for the style but otherwise gorgeous.  s: fairly simple yet quite pleasing. sweet malt and grapefruit/floral notes from the hops.  t: flavors follow the nose but the sweet is toned down a bit by the hop bitterness which is welcomed for this style of beer. this really combines nicely into a pretty nice session beer.  f: ample carbonation pretty crisp and finishes extra dry. good for sessions but you may need some water on hand to combat the dry mouth.  o: pretty solid beer overall. my main gripe with this beer is the extra dry finish. while i am a fan of beers with a semi-dry or even dry finish depending on style this one is just a bit too much for me. was decent for half & halfs (the hop bitterness was actually a little too forward). this pale ale definitely tows the line of ipa but is an interesting take on an american pale ale.
2462,Dale's Pale Ale,3.81,really good beer available widely in the midwest. i know its not a good micro but for what it is excellent.
2463,Coors Light Iced T,5,this was the perfect beer. it is time for coors light iced t to return. i havent stopped thinking about it since 2013
2464,Coors Light Iced T,2.84,2 years ago i was on the beach and at the bar there were serving this new drink for free! so i wanted to give it a try. the smell is quite nice i got to say they tried to reproduce the flavour of the iced tea and i think the combination of it is quite nice on a hot summer day its a real refreshing beer very different that those lime beer. i got to tell u won t get drunk with that beer very easily. thats why i give a 3 because on a hot summer day drink 1 or 2 is definitely refreshing. even for women this beer might impressed u. would i recommend it. i will say yes. its a changement from all those lime beer.
2465,Tecate Original,2.71,great with some fresh squeezed lime juice dressed with tajin seasoning.
2466,Tecate Original,2.5,it has a standard beer flavor however i think this is the first time i\ve tried a bubble-less beer. i\m sorry hombres but at the very least i require bubbles in my brew for enjoyment.  style: mexican lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 4.5% | rating: 2.5
2467,Tecate Original,3.34,july 1 2023
2468,Tecate Original,3.96,presentation: 12 ounce can poured into a pint glass  looks bright golden but clear. good size head  smells a bit more malty than the typical adjunct lager. bit of a floral smell too.  taste: has a roasted malt and grainy taste. minor hops taste. tastes better than i thought it would.  feels smooth in the mouth. easy to drink.  overall this is better then the average mexican lager. it is also cheaper than the other mexican beers somehow. i enjoy this beer with food particularly. very refreshing after a long day at work!
2469,Tecate Original,3.54,a true sleeper beer. it shapes shifts. drink from a can and its a thin mouthful but tasty. smells like an average macro lager. the recipe is german (they settled mexico when it came to beer-making) so grains hops apparent in that smell and taste. pale mexican lager if you use a glass. its a full-caloried beer acting like a light beer. i love the taste and there is a clean aftertaste. the only catch is these need to be really cold. the warmer the worse. yes on of those beers. i would urge all of you to keep rating it under 2.5 so it will never become cool and always be affordable.
2470,Tecate Original,2.83,not a bad lawnmowing/grilling beer
2471,Tecate Original,4.54,this is a very good thirst quenching beer.
2472,Tecate Original,2.38,clear light copper color with a small white head. smell was of something dank and no malt and hops light body with a watery mouthfeel and a strange tin-like bitterness.
2473,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.68,now i understand. this is what every rauchbier i have ever had has been trying to do. campfire smoke malty brown bread caramel and molasses but not syrupy or burnt. werthers and cellars. i love this beer.
2474,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.06,500ml bottle poured into tulip.  pours a dark rootbeer brown with one finger of beige head that leaves a nice sheet of lace as it recedes.  smells like beef jerky. smoked meat garlic rosemary thyme onion burned bread and roasted caramel malt.  tastes of pumpernickel blackened toast roasted caramel malt barbecue smoke some more subdued meat flavors and some cowboy coffee.  feels deep and rich. full bodied with subtle carbonation. finishes chewy.  verdict: vigorously recommended. a highly unusual but very enjoyable beer. it would go pretty well with a steak or a burger or something.
2475,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,5,deep dark rosy color with tan head that kept it to the bottom. nose is medium with strong smoky almost acrid characteristics. taste is deep and rich smoke. well-balanced. mouthfeel is rich and creamy despite strong smokiness. great beer.
2476,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.19,smoked beer on steroids. more intense finish than their other beers but the aroma is weaker. excellent smoked rauchbier.
2477,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.34,mahogany hue with a small sudsy head. cured meat and campfire smoke aroma probably the strongest of the schlenkerla beers that i’ve tried. medium-to-full bodied mouthfeel that was nicely carbonated. tasted some caramel malts behind all that smokiness. strong desire to barbeque something now. long lasting lingering finish. drinking this right after their fastenbier. slight edge to the urbock.
2478,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,3.87,this one really grew on me over the course of the bottle. love me all the smoked meats but find smoke flavor off-putting in a beverage. this one smells and tasted deeply of smoke. however its so well-crafted and balanced by an absolutely delicious malt presence thats neither too sweet nor too bitter.
2479,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.18,500 ml bottle  pours a clear dark chestnut brown in color thick cream colored head. aroma is a wonderful balance of bready malts and savory woody smoke. taste is similar although the smoke is more subdued in the taste. medium bodied.
2480,Wintervention,4.02,16oz can with no date opened 12-25-22. 2 finger beige frothy head with great retention. no lacing. dark brown body with amber highlights. spicy nose full of clove light cinnamon nutmeg and dark fruit. malt brown sugar baking spices - all deftly balanced and very tasty. medium body and somewhat creamy mouthfeel in a moderate length and lightly sweet finish. 10% isnt apparent at all at the sip but definitely warming. very good.
2481,Wintervention,4.02,what can i say? peticolas is a brewery that grows on me. when i started this beer i couldnt help feeling that it lacked something as a winter warmer. the body was thinner than i expected and yet it still managed to coat the tongue. the aroma lacks something but the more i smell it the more i notice. the taste seemed a bit light on the malt and roast with little spice but as i drink the layers keep sticking around and the flavor has developed into a deep rich spice with refreshing bitterness after each sip.  its a good beer. probably the best winter warmer ive had even if i didnt believe it at first.
2482,Wintervention,4.19,had this beer at the craft beer cellar in dallas on tap. poured into a small snifter. dark grayish brown color with good head and excellent curtain lacing. warm spice smell and taste. cinnamon allspice ginger. nice comforting beer that nicely fits the description of winter warmer.
2483,Wintervention,4.87,best winter beer in dfw. extremely aromatic. spices everywhere. slightly hot...just enough.
2484,Wintervention,4, malts and sweets!  graham cracker and cloves. i also get apricots cinnamon nutmeg spices and predominantly chocolate. caramel and toffee follows. the heat is almost not there but it sneaks in at the back.  mouth is smooth and velvety. has a thicker body with a buttery slide. very nice.  this is a wonderful beer! i love winter warmers (when they\re well-made). this is a good double winter warmer if you will. the flavors just dance around nicely and the complexity of the beer really stands out.
2485,Fresh Squeezed IPA,5,one of the most refreshing ipas i’ve ever had. a perfect balance oh hops sweetness and citrus. i bought this one randomly but after just one bottle i knew it was going to become my go-to ipa.
2486,Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.58,pours clear with light head and golden color. aromas are flowery and candy like very strong and pleasant. taste is nice but not as good as what i was expecting for the ratings i was seeing. i was expecting this to taste a lot jucier. has some sour after notes and not as bitter as i was hoping for. has a thick feel in the mouth but feels too bubbly like too much carbonation.  a good beer for sure but i doubt that i would buy this one again.
2487,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.17,12oz can. bottom stamp reads pkg on 04/24/23. mostly clear deep gold colored body. three fingers of off white head which after a couple of minutes reduces to a fluffy cap. leaves behind wide horizontal strips of lacing. aroma of toasted caramel malts orange pineapple and pine resin. taste is kind of sweet and proclaims loudly the citrus and pine. bitterness is noticeable but not extreme. all fade slowly in the aftertaste. medium mouth feel. juicy yet drying at the end. excellent carbonation. very solid ipa which really embraces the expression of hops.
2488,Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.81,poured from a bottle into a pint glass. pours copper red with a small white head. smells of citrus and floral hops. tastes of citrus hops with nice grain. beer is light bodied and easy drinking. overall a good beer.
2489,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.31,july 2023. hartwell. extremely hearty and meringue like head. overall a very well balanced beer. karen thought it was too orange and i needed to deduct a few points. slightly better will probably try it again.
2490,Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.9,look: deep cloudy amber with creamy off white head. smell: apricot malt butterscotch taste: malty medium hops feel: full body with nice carbonation.  nice brew.
2491,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.25,fresh squeezed ipa is in my top 5 favorite ipa beers. thank you deschutes brewery for making a great beer.
2492,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.48,classic aroma and taste of an ipa. for me it is better than 90% of the ipa i have tasted. look: light golden color taste: the taste is rich manly and fruity. a lingering light bitterness in the after taste.
2493,Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.37,poured copper golden with off-white head... but has a ton of chunks suspended in it about the size of sea-salt grains. canned on 1-23-2023 so maybe it is nearing the end of it\s best-by stage. not very appealing look. smell is good though with typical pine and citrus. taste is fine but the hops have diminished greatly. much malt on the palette... too much malt for the style (likely because of how old the beer is; even though 4 months is not very long...) feel is okay still carbonated but nothing special. overall old beer. i would not touch this again unless it\s less than 2 months old.
2494,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.21,one of the best widely distributed ipas along with dogfish head.
2495,Bud Light Lime Apple-Ahhh-Rita,4.25,great fall beverage and this one taste just like a caramel apple and drinking is just as delicious as eating on. i would drink this one over and over in the fall
2496,Bud Light Lime Apple-Ahhh-Rita,3.6,i have been winnowing down the bottle backlog here at chez woody at the expense of the canquest (tm) when i realized that i have never reviewed this gem in a 25-fl. oz. can. mmmm.  from the can: limited fall edition; margarita with a twist; try it over ice!  i really miss the aural aspect of cans when i am reviewing bottles so the crack! in this case was music to my ears. the size of the can was too beaucoup for me to canduct an inverted glug so i used a gentler version to decant the beer into my glass. it was very effervescent but it produced no head whatsoever. it was very fizzy though. color was a beautiful golden-amber (srm = > 5 < 7) with ne-plus quality clarity. the gelt gang of mammon midas and croesus stopped by for a taste and i used the time to smell it. it had a sweet apple juice/apple cider smell so i give them points for truth in advertising. mouthfeel was thin watery with a fizziness that i found interesting. it was very much alcopop and no wonder they felt canpelled to label it as contains alcohol since it would be easy to get carried away with this at 8%. phew. the taste was unmistakably apple but it was not as sweet as the nose had led me to expect. we drank a bunch ciders last night but they were very dry while this was more semi-dry. the finish was pleasant semi-dry and not as bad as i might have thought. more damning with faint praise.
2497,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.4,12 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition had 1/26/23.  pours near black and opaque with a half inch foamy head and some foamy lacing. aromas of coffee roasted malt vanilla some chocolate and oak light char bourbon as it warms. flavors of coffee dark roast malt bourbon oak vanilla as it warms light chocolate a little malted milk balls. has a decent amount of malt/hop bitterness. smooth a solid full body appropriately carbonated.  lots of delicious coffee on top of the always solid base is a winning combination. the barrels are light but effective. hope this comes around again.
2498,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.25,had 2022 vintage on tap at the bine 2023-04-20 . really nice sweet but roasty creamy vanilla and chocolate and coffee.
2499,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.54,look: it pours very dark brown with a brown head. it has low head retention.  smell: it has strong coffee aromas with chocolate. there are some vanilla elements with light wood. the alcohol is noticeable.  taste: it has strong coffee and chocolate flavors. there are some wood elements with vanilla. there is a very low brownie batter like flavor in the background.  feel: it has strong but pleasant alcohol warming with a bitter finish. the bitterness is a little sharp but certainly not overpowering.  overall its has strong alcohol but its not hot. the chocolate and coffee flavors blend well together with a few background compliments.
2500,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.41,finally got to try this. i must say for the price it was well worth it. look: dark as night smell: bourbon coffee light vanilla taste: well balanced coffee upfront bourbon on the back end feel: medium body overall: great beer and great value $6.99 for a 12 ounce bottle
2501,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.09,a nice ba coffee stout. very thin for todays market which is an attribute in general to me but this one goes a little too far into the cold brew coffee territory.  nose is excellent light roast coffee. floral notes over dark chocolate classic diner coffee and some charred malt. taste follows with the cold brew coffee note taking the lead.  great stuff. not sure its worth the premium over regular speedway everyday. but now and again it definitely is.
2502,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.44,great look black with a good amount of tan head. smell is amazing with coffee/vanilla/oak/bourbon. taste is a little too much bitter coffee but the barrel starts to shine one it warms way up. tad thin for my preference. overall an excellent beer.
2503,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.34,2022. bought for ~15$ at alesmiths brewery in san diego ca for a beer tasting with my buddy ron. just a few quick notes because during these tastings i dont spend too much time writing.  a&s: decent caramel-colored head with some lacing. black but not jet-black colored beer. the aroma has chocolate and caramel components and is not in your face.  t&m: the vanilla dominates. the beer is light but flavorful. oaky is a major component as well. 14.2 is very deceptive especially before it warms. the mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. the carbonation is on the higher side of medium.  overall: very solid would recommend.
2504,Baltic Porter,4.68,l- reminds me of a. imperial stout thick dark black dense  s- chocolate coffee sweet vanilla  t- follows the nose  f- medium to full vey low carbonation quickly fading to a stillness  o- an excellent example of a baltic porter
2505,Baltic Porter,4.03,355 ml botlle from vinmonopolet nettbutikken. black colour large tan head. aroma of roast malts coffee prunes raisins and chocolate. soft mouthfeel. medium sweet flavour with the same elements as the aroma. fairly low bitterness. enjoyable.
2506,Baltic Porter,2.8,2013 vintage; drank 2/6/15 @ yuss haus.  dark brown appearance.  dark tan head; minimal lace.  tart cherry & mild booze heat nose.  medium thick creamy mouthfeel.  bakers chocolate & cream of wheat flavors up front; pickle juice & mild booze heat on the finish.  sadly as this warmed the pickle juice took over. not very good.
2507,Baltic Porter,4.28,bottle conditioned - may 2015.  pours pitch black and oily. thin tan head dissipates steadily leaving just a thin ring of mocha colored foam along the outside of the beer. beer appears thick and viscous when poured.  aroma has notes of cocoa dark fruits roasted malts and molasses. very nice aroma albeit somewhat subdued - however that is to be expected given the age of this bottle.  taste is quite smoky with notes of roasted and smoked malts molasses chocolate and dark fruits. incredibly complex array of flavors. not a ton of hops here but again not unexpected given the age of this bottle. the smokiness here really is quite lovely. no bitterness is left on the finish.  feel is thick with a nice heft to it. semi-dry finish. light vibrant carbonation.  overall this is a lovely beer and the age on this has done nothing but wonders.
2508,Baltic Porter,3.52,a bit overrated by other reviewers. a solid stout all around but not exceptional like a sam smiths.
2509,Baltic Porter,4.35,12oz bottle marked bottle conditioned mar. 2015 abv 9% poured into a smuttynose pint glass at fridge temp. the beer pours very dense dark brown with a little bit of light brown head. the head recedes to a paper thin coating with a sheet of lacing working down the glass as consumed. the aroma is dark charred malt and a little bakers dark chocolate. the taste is roasty malts up front then a little tangy flavor & maybe a little dark fruit finishing with a big semisweet chocolate finale. mouthfeel is medium to full bodied well carbonated with a wet yet uncloying finish. overall very good. i had cellered this bottle since 2015 and it makes me sad this is not available locally anymore. recommended.
2510,Baltic Porter,4.01,l — for a porter pours a very dark brown with a two-finger light brown head produced with aerated pour. minimal retention and some lacing s — molasses barley malts bakers chocolate stonefruits and a touch of smoke and bacon t — leads with a good amount of dark chocolate well-roasted barley malts and smoke. followed by hints of dark roast coffee molasses and candied prune f — moderately thick silky mouthfeel. medium carb. restrained bitterness on the finish o — reminds me a lot of smutty’s robust porter although a little more intense. somewhat surprised that this is currently beeradvocate’s highest rated beer in new hampshire since it’s pretty nondescript overall (although still well put together!)  81/100
2511,1838er,4.31,poured from a bottle at fridge temp. pours a dark brown with light brown head. nose is lemon rich malts a touch of citrus peel toffee figs and bread. the taste is orange citrus peel wheat grass candy honey and caramel. light and crisp. overall a fantastic beer.
2512,1838er,4.46,brauerei schumacher 1838 255€ / 25l on tap at the brewery on 28 september 2021  look: crystal clear copper colored body with golden and orange highlights beneath a full head of off-white. excellent head retention and lacing. smell: clean and fresh with floral and fruity hops crusty bread and caramel. taste: the flavor follows the aroma with notes of floral hops an apple and berry-like fruitiness crusty bread medium and dark caramel and herbal hops. a median bitterness balances it leading to a dry lingering earthy and spicy finish. feel: medium bodied and gently crisp with a natural fine-bubbled median carbonation. overall: this is quite possibly the best bier in all of düsseldorf.
2513,1838er,4.21,pours a deep dark amber coppery coloration with a large foamy head. smells of caramel malt and citrus fruit with a certain grainy slightly grassy note as well. taste is a very nice balance of caramel bready malt and citrus hops with notes of toffee grapefruit red berries and white grape. there is a light underlying graininess and grassiness to this as well. finishes with a mild bitterness medium bodyand carbonation.  im actually not gonna rate this to style because if i did my score would be much lower and that would be unfair to a very tasty brew. while this does retain certain characteristics of an alt beer it is definitely not a purebred alt beer in my opinion. if you were to serve this to someone in a blind taste test not in a million years would they identify it as an alt. due to the strong hoppy notes it is much closer to a pale ale or even an amber ale in my mind which is not a bad thing at all. after all why shouldnt a traditional alt brewery experiment with other styles i applaud them for it.
2514,1838er,5,stange at the brewery. my seventh 5/5 incredible beer. looks as good as their flagship alt slightly lighter in color. nose is thick rich toffee; i could believe its more candy than beer. strong caramel notes up front give way to gentle grapefruit hops and a clean easy finish. the flavors are vibrant and clear but never cloying or overpowering. definitely an alt rather than ipa but the little dash of yakima fits it perfectly.

2516,1838er,4.35, has an ember red deep brown color with a perfect head thick which stays very long. perfect looking alt!  the most important thing first the 1838er has an unusual aroma for an alt because of the fruity hoppyness in it. its the first alt i have ever experienced with a very well balanced hoppy impact going along with the usual malt body due to cascade and galaxy hops schumacher brauerei brewed in for this anniversary beer. aroma of caramel citrus blueberries plums and grapes malt is present but not dominant in this beer.  the hops add a very interesting complexity has a refreshing taste going into a ipa direction without forgetting of still being an alt. balance is great in this a noticable bitterness kicks in after the typical bready malt beginning which by itself has fruity undertones in it. the fruity bitterness is a very nice addition to the typical alt-character. in the end malt is still the most important part of the 1838er it is present all the time but goes along with an interessting bitterness which creates a very smooth mouthfeel.  in addition to that in my opinion this beer is very outstanding because it is so different compared to the usual altbier. at this very moment many different brewers are trying to create many new beer interpretations not only in the usa but also in germany. still this movement has not reached the very traditional altbier-scene and the 1838er can be seen as a first attempt to reach out for new flavors.
2517,Oude Geuze,4.43,bottled on march 21 2018. drank on august 16 2023.
2518,Oude Geuze,4.24,poured from 375ml corked & caged bottle into my beeradvocate teku. bottled 3/13/19; best by 10/26/39.  appearance: medium golden hue with a light haze and a frothy but low head of ivory foam. pretty.  smell: a lovely and balanced combination of sweet tart and earthy. it has kind of a savory candy thing going on; it\s really great.  taste: bright and just a bit tart with a subdued sweetness and a good earthy maltiness. it many not be super complex but it is very very good.  mouthfeel: light body with a light carbonation and a refreshing fizziness. never having had this before i dont know if thats typical for oude geuze; when i popped the cork it didnt seem super carbonated.  overall: a delicious and refreshing tasty treat on this warm summer day. very glad i snagged myself a bottle of this.
2519,Oude Geuze,4.5,i have even saving this bottle for a bit. it is 2019 vintage. recently got a promotion so i wanted to celebrate a bit.  really an excellent beer! pours a bright golden yellow color with a fluffy white head and excellent curtain lacing. smell and taste of sweet and tart appleas and sweet pears. rustic earthy and woodsy with a refreshing fruity finish. i wish i had another bottle!
2520,Oude Geuze,4.47,(375 ml bottle blend no 52 season 18/19 bottled 13 mar 2019 6.6% abv; purchased single at benash yesterday... decanted into my chouffe tulip)  l: mildly-hazy yellow-orange colored liquid; messy cap persists after initial pad decay... laces a little; looks dirty near murky  s: textbook: nutty lemon rainy spring day smutty penny hints of rustic white bread and apple cider vinegar... the nutty breadiness increases as it aerates... peppery onion spicy; note of sweat  t: green grassy earthiness lighting up front of palate; moderate cider-lemon brightness in the bottom-back of the palate... this morning its still raining and this perfectly compliments the aromas... aftertaste dry vaguely bready with the nuttiness of a mother... the finish has a lovely length and intensity  f: satiny spread tingly tang mineral twinge and parch... wheated bounce up front sticky funk smearing acid ting numbing the backs of my teeth roof of my mouth... my sinuses are opening view brightening... longing for more goat-licking sticky... textures/body seem broader more bracing than other brands  o: a travesty i never tried this before; of course ive hesitated getting their other brands due to cost and seeing myself getting carried away... might be my new go-to when i get that hankering; solid. (2138)
2521,Oude Geuze,4.5,took me back to belgium at my first taste.
2522,Oude Geuze,4.29,fairly clear pour at first it turned a little hazy as i could not properly leave out some of the stuff at the bottom of the bottle. there isnt much head to talk of but a thin collar of bubbles shows it isnt a still beer. the nose is my favorite part with a lemon spritzed tart nectarine impression with an slight cider vinegar edge and some light funky cheese. combine those more acidic notes with backup scent of light cereal malt and even lighter herbal components.  on the lighter side with the mix of tangy sour and micro-carbonation leavening things. the taste isnt quite as complex as the nose with a bit more of a herbaceous bitterness than i expected at least relative to the tartness. the beer has an acidic component that pairs with this for sure but on my tongue it seems to go for the sides while the lightly herbal wood tannin note takes up the middle. as it warms the sour level slowly increases pushing the more bitter aspect further back on my palate.  i loved the nose and my enjoyment of the taste increased as i sipped. glad to finally get to review this.
2523,Oude Geuze,4.6,pours a straw colour. looks beautiful. nice head and good lacing is left over as it dissipates.  smells of barnyard funk and that sort of sourdough yeast that you get on 3 fonteinen lambics. lots of fresh fruit character. apricot pear some fresh apple wet straw.  the oak barrel comes through nicely. lots of funky fruit notes. lemon zest apricot orange intangible citrus notes grape skin.  medium body with a reeeally long and dry finish. the finish is great.  this is a fantastic gueuze. always worth the price and so consistent.
2524,Oude Geuze,5,superb gueze!
2525,Oude Geuze,4.32,750ml bottle into a tulip. bottled 11/21/18 best by 10/26/38.  superb looking beer. glowing pale amber body with swarms of carbonation. big bright white head persists in lesser form throughout leaving a lattice work of lacing.  slightly funky aroma.  on tasting not much funk. dry sour tart. the other word that comes to mind is clean not what you might think of in a gueuze. such an easy drinker here. a small fruit note.  mouth above medium finish a dry sour tartness.  overall such a great example of the style hits all the right notes subtle delicate flavorful not a bum note anywhere. a bit pricey so a treat once in a while.
2526,Oude Geuze,3.62,bottle into glass minimal white head. very slightly milky medium light orange amber & golden appearance. unusual earthy and almost mildew like aroma with a spiced and touch of vinegar tinge as well. definite lemony and touch of clove deep down in the depths of the taste with a light body and tanginess with a little bit of a medium toasted malt underneath.
2527,Oude Geuze,4.43,blend 43 season 19|20 bottle 4/2/20  it’s always an honor to drink a gueuze of any kind and this one seems to be one of the most popular at least on ba. this is my first 3 fonteinen beer since armand passed so this one goes out to him. let’s dive in  pours a hazy burnt orange with a finger of white head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  the funk in the nose is soft it really relies more on fleshy fruit than anything else. i’m picking up on aromas of tart peach jammy apricot lemon juice wet hay white wine stone white pepper light cracker and apple skin  it’s a bit more forward in taste and still very damn impressive. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting tart apricot orange zest apple skin white wine vinegar stone light leather and lemon juice. the swallow brings notes of tannic white wine bready malt lemon zest white pepper stone wet hay and jammy apricot  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a funky and zesty beer. finishes mostly dry with more earth than tartness  goddamn i loved this one. it’s very nuanced but not overly aggressive. sucks that lambic has to be so pricey but it’s fun to splurge every now and then
2528,Oude Geuze,4.5,a 750ml corked and caged bottle blend°63 season 18/19 bottled on 3rd april 2019. served from a 3 fonteinen lambic basket and poured into a 3 fonteinen gueuze glass.  appearance: a nice clear golden colour with a just over one finger white head that had decent retention while leaving some nice lacing.  aroma: lightly tart barnyard funky oak hay green apple with light lemon notes.  taste: sour tart funk oak hay green apple lime lemon with light notes of grape skin.  mouthfeel: medium bodied with high lively carbonation.  overall: surprised i didn’t review this much earlier. for an oude geuze in the core range this is right up there among the best in my opinion along with 3f a&g and tilquin oude gueuze. i also specifically picked blend°63 of season 18/19 because it’s been one of my favourites lately since the paper label blends of 2015 and earlier. it’s just super easy and enjoyable to drink it’s basically something i could down at all hours of the day.

2531,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.27,i am trying a can of this beer at my brah-in-law s house whilst there for thanksgiving. it poured an opaque dark with tan ring head that is not leaving any lace. the scent had dark chocolate and roast notes. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip. there was dark chocolate malt base with roast and espresso highlights. the mouthfeel was fuller in body and had good carbonation. overall it is a solid beer.

2536,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.26,2016 on tap at red pig brewing. very nice imperial stout!
2537,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),3.05,bomber from winco. dark brown with thick creamy head. aroma is root beer some sassafras some vanilla. taste takes a downturn. alcohol burn up front. licorice obscures the root beer aroma. sweet medicinal earthy. finishes the same. started out nice and went downhill from there.
2538,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),5,i love it!!sad you can’t get the real stuff any more the pabst one can’t compare to it.
2539,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),3.91,definitely one of the best options available for those who love soda and want an alcoholic drink other than jack and coke. ive rated this one unobjectively as an overall product to the target demographic.
2540,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),3.24,mahogany brown in color with an fingernail of brown around the rim and covering half of the top. the aroma is flat root beer with a slightly sweet boozy edge. the taste is smoky root beer and black licorice. theres plenty of booze and it isnt well hidden. theres a bit of dry stickiness and theres definitely a boozy burn on the way down. not sure what i was expecting but not sure what some of the others see in this. my opinion of this beer increased greatly as it warmed.
2541,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),4.79,this very unique and fragrant root-beer pours a nice dark color with very little head.  the nose is super complex and spicy with strong hints of vanilla cinnamon cloves anise cherries alcohol and earthy notes.  the taste is also very complex and compliments the nose perfectly. the complexity really comes out as the root beer gets a bit warmer. this also leaves a pleasant warm glow in your stomach. again the presence of strong hints of vanilla cinnamon cloves anise cherries alcohol are all there.  the mouthfeel is slightly more watery than i expected but this could easily be attributed to the volume of alcohol.  overall this is an exceptional root beer. i highly recommend trying it as it is very pleasant to drink.
2542,Not Your Father's Root Beer (10.7%),4.54,wow really surprised. poured from a 25 oz bottle into a snifter. the appearance is pitch black with a small tan head. the aroma is root beer and alcohol. the taste follows the nose. the best hard root beer i have had.
2543,Sphere,4.28,my second beer using the new yeast after satin and theres a strong similarity between the two. not just hazy this one pours milky yellow/orange. nose is more muted than is usual for treehouse but it got stronger as the beer warmed with the galaxy being very noticeable.  taste is of generic fruit with lots of astringent rind. that rind is what makes it a little different from a hundred other neipas but there\s nothing about it that screams treehouse.  in summary a competent ne(d)ipa but nothing id go out of way for (which puts it below most treehouse beers).
2544,Sphere,4.25,serving: can canned: jul-21-2023 consumed: aug-11-2023  pours milky white-yellow with a middling head. the aroma is fairly punchy upon popping the can. generic tropical fruit. once in the glass however--while still nice-smelling--this punchiness is a bit diminished and still just generically fruity. the flavor has a bit more of a thin bitterness than expected or suggested by the nose. this lingers into the finish. not quite juicy either in taste smell or body. the mouthfeel is along similar lines. a little fluffiness but not quite as luxurious as i am used to with their beers. a little astringency but not quite astringent. it feels weird to not just pound in my normal 4.75s for look and feel on a th beers. we\re in strange times... when i saw what they were doing for the data set series i was bummed id missed it but i am really glad to be able to taste what came out the other end (thanks papillon senses!).  still not a fan. first off maybe its the power of suggestion however as a fanboy i really wanted to like it so where does that leave us? secondly this was a little on the older side yet not only did none of what i picked up jibe with age but at the brewery i had a very fresh one with the same yeast and got the same overall impression; on a different day in a different setting. finally the other beer i had (velvet) was all new-fangled hops that i dont have much experience with. however this one was good old standbys that not only do i know well but i know well specifically in th beers.  what it all comes down to for me is that whether it\s a good biotransforming yeast strain(s) or not the ester profile is sorely sorely missed and in its place there is an ever-so-slight astringency (not the most adequate word maybe hollowness?) to the hop character that takes away from the beer. i am far from an expert but have had a lot of their beers at multiple stages of my life as a beer nerd and their life as a brewery. that first smell and drink of a th beer is always obviously a th beer and it has always been exquisite. this one was not obviously theirs in that sense and was very good at best. no audible gasps here. that\s a first for me (or in this case a second after velvet).  anyway i am extremely happy to have tried this. it was a really educational experience. it reinforces my belief that even though you can load something down with hops and get something delicious in the best of neipas the yeasts ester profile is doing at least as much for the overall character. if you count biotransformation maybe even more. so as they say: if it aint broke dont fix it.  4.25...4.25...4.25...4.25...4.25
2545,Sphere,4.31,had on tap at sandwich. pours milky peach in color with one third inch head. taste is peach cherry dank hops and pineapple. medium light body moderate carbonation slightly bitter. impressive. one of their better recent releases. have not been a fan of some of he recent new yeast stuff but this is good.
2546,Sphere,4.29,from a 16oz can dated 07/21/23. served in a spiegelau ipa glass.  pours a murky utterly opaque milky-orange with a finger-plus of super-soft creamy head. retention is excellent leaving a sudsy cap and a solid sheet of foamy lacing. this is what nedipa looks like.  nose is creamy sweet and all-over squishy jungle fruit - aromas of ripe pineapple and mango ice cream.  taste is dank as the dickens less sweet and creamy and with more rindy bitterness than anticipated. tasting grapefruit rinds and woody underripe pineapple cores grapefruit juice mango skins orange peel sandalwood and bhang water. a little pardonable onion.  feel is juicy medium-plus bodied with bright tingly carbonation. hop oils and carbonation combine in a peppery tongue-coating firecracker assault. spot-on relative to the style.  overall dank and juicy as is thoroughly right and proper. legitimately bitter albeit in an unripe fruit peel sort of way. the can promises me a ‘lush wave of overripe pineapple’ but i found the pineapple to be underripe and woody and could easily have believed that i was tasting a ‘touch’ of simcoe rather than of citra. i’m going to rate most aspects of this rather highly based on the one pour however i don’t think i could possibly drink a 2nd can without a full 12 hour rest break in between.
2547,Thumbprint Enigma,4.18,12oz bottle. no dating information found but the label name is enigma 23. brown colored body. light tan head sticks around as an island and expanded ring. leaves behind small lacing webs. aroma of cherries oak and woody yeast. taste is a sweet tart combination. flavors of cherry oak vanilla caramel chocolate and a little smoke. woody yeast arrives late and lingers into the aftertaste. smooth and silky mouth feel. dry finish. good carbonation. a layered beer with cherry upfront and yeast at the end and all supported by the oak barrel. vinous to a degree.
2548,Thumbprint Enigma,4.03,poured from a 12oz bottle into a tall new glarus pilsner glass. pours like coca cola out of the bottle but gathers in the glass a murky dark brown with three fingers of sandy brown foam. the nose and taste is a somewhat muddled mix of oak delicate and yeasty funk faint black cherry and event hints of red grapes. however i get a slightly flanders-esque vinegar aroma and flavor that i just don’t care for as it’s very distracting. medium-full mouthfeel. pretty slick and smooth. as it warms though i just get more of the vinegar. a little bit of an unusual flop from this place.
2549,Thumbprint Enigma,4.23,pours dark amber with a nice dark head. aroma is dark cherries and wild yeast (strange as that may sound). taste is sour but pleasantly so with again dark cherries and a moderate to light body. nicely different.
2550,Thumbprint Enigma,4.41,(12 oz bottle no date/code enigma 23; purchased single last week from their beer depot... poured into my chouffe tulip)  dark reddish-brown liquid limited-to-no-clarity; tall rouge-tan foam stand tight and creamy; a few lacy bands... very floral-forward aromas with cherry-vanilla ice cream at the base and a nutty yeast accent; bits of chocolate chunk and wood speckled in... woody almost nutty brown ale flavor sits in a thin layer between a cherry-flecked flowery top note and the tart cherry-soaked but relatively dry clearly oak-hewned malt-rich base brown-ed ale colored with soft touches of milk chocolate and cocoa snaps... i must reiterate this is not a sweet beer though its got all the desserty flavors just begging for decadent dulce... not so much bitter as it is more tart stamping a stingy stripe across the middle of the tongue... brief bit of bouncy roundness to its body before it drops mad dry at the palate floor airy aft but leaving a woody-tannic warmth pasting the palate roof... this tastes and drinks beautifully though looks a little suspect and has that superb cherry accent to it that doesnt feel quite right but ultimately arguably for sure (mostly) tastes like a flemish brown; this is a work of art wish i knew and bought more (2198)
2551,Thumbprint Enigma,3.99,appearance: dark brown with a thin head.  smell: some wood first then funky acidic maybe a hint of cherry.  taste: tart beer with some brown sugar and sour cherry in the background and finish.  overall: picked up a single at the brewery. im not usually a tart/sour beer guy but im willing to try and tick a style. its an interesting beer but not one ill revisit.
2552,Thumbprint Enigma,4,thanks to fbarber for this one from a ninja box during nbs bif #12. 12oz bottle (no date) poured into 6oz ng flute (also courtesy fbarber). poured a dark brown color with some reddish hints at the translucent edges. there was 1/4 inch of tan head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing.  the aroma had nice malts good wood scents some cherry and a touch of yeast spice/funk.  pretty similar on the tongue with the funk taking the lead. the fruit was noticeable but not dominant and the wood added a nice counterpoint.  the body was on the thinner side smooth and had a dry finish.  drinkability was very nice but its a sipper not a quaffer.  overall another great brew from ng. a must-try if you see it.
2553,DDDoublegangerrr,4.51,this one pours a very hazy golden orange color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells super tropical with nectarine mango pineapple lime and peach.  this is a creamy treat for sure with a dense and juicy hop character and just a hint of bitterness on the back end. it’s got such a full and vibrant flavor to it – it’s a nice step up from an already great ipa.  this is creamy thick and super drinkable with a smooth finish.  this is an absolute delight. i have just been having really great luck with tree house ipas lately.
2554,DDDoublegangerrr,4.63,l - creamy opaque golden orange with a fluffy white head that sticks around a little bit leaving behind a good amount of lacing s -fresh piney bitter hops followed by sweet tropical fruits and citrus t - follows the nose - fresh piney bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with tropical fruits - pineapple orange grapefruit - with some malt on the backend f - medium leaning towards full bodied with moderate carbonation. smooth o - very similar to most tree house neipas ive had truly fantastic but just ever so slightly more hoppy
2555,DDDoublegangerrr,4.63,excellent head production retention and lacing. beautiful beer in the style.  very slight herbal edge to the aroma but not nearly so dank as amarillo and mosaic can trend. juicy notes are a decent balance of tropical and citrus fruit with perhaps a slight edge to the latter.  flavor follows as its a creamy juicy fruity iipa that carries a slight herbal edge to round out the profile. tasting notes of melon pineapple papaya mandarin orange nectarine lemon lime. while the nose is fairly balanced between the main fruity notes the palate certainly leans more tropical.  creamy with a light liveliness and slight bite. fantastic and full bodied.
2556,DDDoublegangerrr,4.81,look - fantastic thick hazy honey orange with a thick white milky tad yellow head that last and sticky smell - oh my tropical citrus stone fruit galore. taste - basically the same as the smell sweet but not overly sweet. slight boozy feel - medium full body with a medium light slight fizz carb and a slight creamy. overall - really fantastic!
2557,DDDoublegangerrr,4.49,appearance: pours cloudy and the color of peach nectar; the three finger head rises and sticks leaving webs of lacing all over  smell: peach pineapple and mango with a hint of tangerine  taste: peach and mango forward with some pineapple sweetness emerging; through the middle the tangerine adds a citrus dimension; moderate bitterness joins with a juicy finish; maybe just a bit green in the aftertaste  mouthfeel: medium to full bodied and somewhat creamy; moderate carbonation  overall: after a disappointing experience with very green tree house is back on track with this beer
2558,DDDoublegangerrr,4.66,looks like most treehouse double ipas - a mixture of orange and pineapple juice. i have a slight preference for the alter ego/doppelganger family over its sister julius family and that holds true for this - the (so far) top dog in the family. it delivers an intense burst of citrus and other fruit wrapped in a creamy mouthfeel but i do think it could use a touch more bitterness at the end - theres less than i remember in the lower abv variants. interestingly the aftertaste has quite a bit of bitter orange peel so the bitterness is there - its just masked by the fruit. none of that takes anything away from a lovely beer but its definitely one to take your time over.
2559,DDDoublegangerrr,4.74,mango pineapple stone fruit and ripe oranges on the nose. palate contrasts with slightly earthier tones more pronounced bitterness and a spicy floral finish. a heavy hitter but always something i loved about doubleganger and it’s variations.

2561,Bourbon Paradise,4.55,2019 version poured from a 12oz bottle into a dogfish head snifter on 2/15/2022. aged very well.
2562,Bourbon Paradise,4.32,1822 name: bourbon paradise style: barrel-aged imperial stuff location: kreb oklahoma abv: 13.7 date: 2022  continuing with stouts i chose this from prairie. using my jester tulip glass i let the beer warm up to 56 degrees. a hard pour created a half finger medium dark tan head. the retention is dismal and dropped as fast as it formed. the color of the beer charts arounds srm 36 dark brown with ruby hues. the beer is opaque but does show some carbonation bubbles on the sides of the glass. overall the appearance is average for this style i wanted to see a longer lasting head.  nosing the beer i detect dark chocolate vanilla coconut with espresso. after smelling the beer several more times i notice caramel bourbon oak hints of floral dates raisins slight char roasted malts bready and a touch of maillard.  the chocolate weaves coconut with vanilla seamlessly. other flavors in the beer are caramel bready roasted maltiness raisins figs oak bourbon oak anise soy sauce oranges hints of floral maillard and char.  the heavy roasted malts gives the beer a heavy body and a low carbonation. a chewy thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish.  the beer is tasty yet i have a few complaints. i wanted more coconut flavors and less char. overall the beer is a wonderful example of imperial stout. i enjoyed sipping this one on a cold winter night.
2563,Bourbon Paradise,4.77,as good as it gets
2564,Bourbon Paradise,4.5,on tap at frisco taphouse in crofton md. definitely lives up to expectations - pours pitch black with a tan head huge aromas and flavors of dark roasted malts chocolate coffee bourbon vanilla and some coconut. rich and sumptuous mouthfeel. stellar.
2565,Bourbon Paradise,4.63,its incredibly rich and decadent....its delicious....perhaps the thickest creamiest beer ive ever had... the bourbon is quite evident as it should be... the coconut wafts in and out like a ghost....incredibly intense experience....having this on black friday morning while cooking a breakfast casserole... warming to the belly after a few healthy sips...this is a real banger.  the sort of beer you pull out for just the right moment.. i love it...one is enough due to its intensity and richness...  a masterpiece...
2566,Bourbon Paradise,4.28,poured from bottle to wine glass. super dark color with rich brown head. totally opaque head is very small and is soon totally gone there is some lacing however. strong scents of soy sauce and dark malt i like this though it is bordering on being too strong. taste there is a lot here. extremely rich strong flavors of raw coconut bourbon soy sauce roasted malts licorice. it is delicious but it is simply too much. the beer is creamy and the finish is incredibly long. a great beer but it is just not for me.
2567,Bourbon Paradise,4.45,look - fantastic looking ba stout! black and thick with a really nice thick tan head and fantastic rimming and lacing. not sure what you can do better smell - nutty dark chocolate woody smell. im sure that nut smell comes from the coconut but i dont get the coconut more just nut. maybe some molasses caramel deep in there taste - a little sweet but not overly sweet. dark chocolate some char woodiness along with the toasted coconut and vanilla. feel - medium full body with a medium light carb slight creaminess overall - i like how the vanilla and coconut arent overly done and instead just bring out some great flavors of the beer in different ways. the barrel to this beer is fantastic. well done not overly sweet ba stout
2568,Bourbon Paradise,4.56,awesome. pricy? sure. but worth every sip. the art of the craft.. stuck 2 in the cave for xmas..
2569,Miami Madness,4.45,cloudy orangey yellow body white head. smells and tastes exactly as expected but even more potent and balanced: absolutely huge guava passion fruit and mango with cutting wheat and salt backed by lemon cracker and lactose. but here is the thing i came in expecting this to be underwhelming but the intensity and depth of the fruit flavor then met with contrasting berliner backbone is impressive. feel reflects with tart juice up front dry and snappy wheat on the back end lingering light sweet and salty textures is appreciated though this is certainly a new world take
2570,Miami Madness,3.97,l: hazy orange with a slight white head that disappears quickly  s: guava mango juice and passion fruit in that order  t: restrained fruit compared to what the nose let on. not a bad thing as i am not a fan of alcoholic juice. tart lemon and guava up front. mango on the back end.  f: light bodied. dry and puckering finish.  o: really good fruited sour. a bit overhyped in my opinion though.
2571,Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.89,look - black thick syrup but really nice rimming smell - lots of barrel with a nice vanilla and chocolate taste - chocolate vanilla and barrel feel - thick creamy medium light carb overall - just incredible
2572,Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.84,8/20/2022
2573,Tucher Festbier,3.92,on tap: a moderately hazy pour into a shaker glass didn’t have a lot of head but decent surface coverage was maintained. honey lemon tea malt notes greet my nose as i close in on said glass with a light bit of toasted bread melanoidin. taste is surprisingly more clean and bitter in comparison. the honey malt is noticeable but a somewhat piney / lemongrassy bitterness pairs with it and grabs more attention as each sip evolves. similar to other festbiers i’ve had the bitter and malt notes play together a little better as the beer gets warmer (or my palate adjusts) improving the overall experience.
2574,Tucher Festbier,3.74,there was a strong hops aroma as soon as i opened the can. it started out with two fingers of white creamy head but settled to a thin white layer about halfway through the glass. carbonation is light compared to most lagers. the body is a little heavy and a little sweet but it is well balanced by hops. this is very decent festbier at a very reasonable price. the rating of very good is accurate.
2575,Tucher Festbier,4.07,16.9 oz can filled may 12 2023 into a tall lager glass. l: pours clear light gold with a thin creamy white head that recedes to a thick skin large steady carbonation bubbles medium-light lacing banding & spots. s: malty grains light fruits a hint of bread dough. t: gently bright fruity hops caramelized malts somewhat rich a hint of apple. it is lightly sweet with a fruity bite at the top of each drink. f: brisk bright medium-full body with a smooth middle and a fast clean lightly drying finish. it is gently sticky. o: bright malty and very easy to drink. has a zippy feel and a clean finish. very well balanced taste and feel. it is excellent in its style.
2576,Tucher Festbier,4.17,from a 500ml can brewed 5/12/23. clear amber color with a finger of foamy white head. bready aroma with some floral hops. medium body with good carbonation. rich malty flavor with a herbal finish. first time seeing this and i would get it again.
2577,Tucher Festbier,4.13,a: pours a beautifully clear pale golden/yellow color. a dense white head rises to over two fingers. excellent retention and plenty of lace left behind as it gently recedes. s: pale malts are the show. baked sourdough bread biscuits and honey. this is like walking into a bakery. just a touch of earthy hops. t: love the pales malts again. baked bread biscuits and honey. a bit of an apple cider character. just enough herbal and grassy hops to make a presence without any real bitterness added. m/o: a medium to full body. wonderful carbonation that is at first crisp but becomes ultra fine and silky smooth. with the apple cider like character it does finish a bit sweeter than i would like. though that is a small gripe and can drink this all day in big gulps.  this seems like a great traditional festbeir to me with lots of character. i hope to see this more often i think this is the first time i have noticed this on the shelves near me. ill be getting a lot more.
2578,Tucher Festbier,3.8,a very good light beer that i would recommend for any one wanted to try german style lagers for the first time. it’s very smooth and crisp and not too over dramatically away from traditional american lagers but he just enough flavor to venture out into the craft beer world.
2579,Tucher Festbier,4.02,picked up a 16 oz can from the blue door bottleshop 10-7-22 for $3.25. no discernable canning date; consumed 1-12-23. cold stored since purchase.  beer poured a clear pale gold with a very nice white.  nose is nice bready malts and herbal hops are coming out nicely.  taste is a nice sourdough malt base that is noble hopped and finishes a touch bitter.  mouthfeel is light bodied and refreshing.  overall a solid fest bier!
2580,Tucher Festbier,4.45,good beer. really full albeit subtle and nuanced. malty and warm but presents a lot of classic rustic germanic hop character. i could imagine having several just as much as one can do the trick. really happy to have come across it and it reminds me quite firmly of tuchers helles which is wonderful as well.
2581,Two Hearted IPA,4.27,not too hoppy just as good room temperature as ice cold. better from bottle. wife doesn’t like it so it’s my go-to beer when camping. reasonably priced in my area.
2582,Two Hearted IPA,3.9,12oz can with date code 062823. served in a pint glass. bit coppery color orange amber with a thick white head. very nice start. old school aipa aromas of citrus and maybe some pine. really substantial mouthfeel owing to a solid malt backbone with some crystal malts along with a creamy load of carbonation. maybe even oats in the mash? but anyway this is an ipa and it brings along a very reasonable level of bitterness and piny goodness. makes me think of dogfish 60 minute in terms of flavor profile turned up just a little bit but not as far as 90.  ive been hearing about this middle-of-the-country beer for years and im not disappointed having finally tried it!
2583,Two Hearted IPA,3.58,a staple if you will. gets better as it warms. decent ipa. not too much hops.
2584,Two Hearted IPA,3.51,not a huge ipa guy this was ok. a little too hoppy. won’t buy again
2585,Two Hearted IPA,4.57,wonderful medium-strength ipa with beautiful and nicely balanced flavors of pine and tropical fruits. ideal for winter/fall as this beer will warm your souls. a bit heavy for warm days can feel like a meal.
2586,Two Hearted IPA,4.36,an american pale ale at its most defining characteristic. i’ve grown to love centennial hops and this seems to be available at many stores which as much as i love local craft brews (especially around chicago like 3 floyds and revolution) distribution is key for a transient graduate student as myself who loves consistent tasty beers at reasonable prices. this beer holds its freshness compared to other american ipas which need to be consumed within 6-8 weeks.
2587,Two Hearted IPA,4.5,bells two hearted is a classic ipa that i cant be mad at. its the kind of beer that ill happily buy at a bar and not be disappointed. the look of the beer is see through. the smell is mostly a classic balance of hops and malt. the taste and feel is nothing different. there are only a few ipas that i like better because they have more west coast hops but this beer is as reliable and classic as it comes.
2588,Two Hearted IPA,4.53,pours a rich gold color clear with a foamy white head. smells a little of pine bitterness. taste is well balanced caramel malt flavor with a dry bitter finish.
2589,Two Hearted IPA,5,for many years ive read about how good this beer is...but it wasnt available. about 2 weeks ago i found it at a local store in the 22 oz can section and couldnt believe my eyes. yes..this beer lives up to all the rave reviews. in a world where there are so many great ipas...this one stands out.
2590,Two Hearted IPA,4.66,so darn good had to force it down my mamas throat!
2591,Two Hearted IPA,4.39,l - golden with a good amount of clarity and a white head that sticks around a bit leaving behind a thin cap and some lacing s - juicy piney floral hops along with bright tropical fruit notes along with citrus some malt t - juicy piney floral hops up front intermixed well with tropical fruit notes - pineapple passion fruit some citrus along with crackery malt f - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. juicy o - a very well balanced classic ipa
2592,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.44,poured very dark brown and capped with an ambitious light brown head that climbed three inches very quickly. the aroma to my chemically damaged nose was mild but still featured proper porter smells- roasted malts coffee a touch of chocolate. the taste- i grabbed the can again to verify but vanilla plays top position. not sweet at all but no mistaking there is vanilla in here. coffee shows up later this drinks true as it warmed. the feel was good ideal even. not sure if it could be better. ideally viscous. oa- very happy to have been able to try this finally!
2593,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.97,if youve ever wondered what could make a great porter even better it is notes of vanilla. this beer has a rich coffee flavor and a satisfyingly vanilla aftertaste. color is dark and consistency is very smooth. its a shame i cant buy it in texas.
2594,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.43,can pour- dark as night with foamy khaki head leaving frosty/foamy lacing and a ring of bubbles. nose is vanilla and coffee for days. taste follows with some roasty malt and mild espresso bitterness. vanilla lingers on the finish. tasty.
2595,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.21,2021 release from can. poured from fridge temp. pours black with a really good amount of light brown head. sticks around for quite a while as well. nose is incredible. vanilla marshmallow coffee dark chocolate red licorice burnt toffee and a nice amount of dark fruit. the taste nicely follows the nose but with a distinct bitterness on the back end. vanilla and coffee (very dark) are dominant. definitely some charred wood black licorice roasted malts almonds and tar. not sweet at all. mouthfeel is fairly thick. overall a really nice coffee stout.
2596,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.37,after being impressed by the high west ba version of this a few weeks ago i figured id give this a shot. quite affordable at $3 for a single bottle given it currently sits at #323 of all time on this site  pours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs  the aroma here is sweet but not overly so bringing a nice balance of vanilla hazelnut toast milk chocolate medium roast coffee and a slight dark fruit note  a bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip starting off with notes of cocoa powder lightly toasted malt raisin and a touch of grain alcohol. the swallow makes this one a bit sweeter bringing notes of rich vanilla slightly astringent coffee milk chocolate and almond  a medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper. the finish is mostly dry due to the roasty character of the coffee  damn delicious beer right here. it hits all the notes expected and doesnt feel overly sweet or strong despite the high abv. id definitely get it again
2597,Coors Banquet,3.36,drank a lot of this in college in wyoming many moons ago but have not had one in at least 25 years. a 6 was $2.39 back then so yes ancient times. grabbed one tonight.  looks good but loses a little for poor foam retention.  smell is clean and light. sweet malt a little fresh mown hay and a faint earthy/floral hop presence (so faint i may be imagining it)  taste is light all around but malt is a little firmer than most aals. bitterness balances the other light flavors. very light floral hops that balance well with the malt.  feel is a bit more substantial than its competitors without being out of style. satisfying. could do with a little less carbonation; belching as i write this though some may consider that a positive.  overall very good for what it is. a cut above most similar beers. back in the day coors was looked down upon in co and nearby states. i actually set up a blind tasting on my dorm floor and was able to convince my classmates that it was good stuff. still remember this beer on tap at the brewery as one of the best ive had.
2598,Coors Banquet,1.76,12 ounce (355 ml) can poured into shaker pint glass nice head of foam. smells faintly of grains. tastes like beer. mouthfeel clean crisp refreshing. not too snooty and low abv at 5%. good for football both euro and american. i would give it a soid b. bbd: 12/23 btw. (personally i prefer tennents but that i s a rare animal around this here parts lol)
2599,Coors Banquet,3.45,i like this beer its incredibly light crisp and refreshing when served chilled. the look is a straw yellow with a quick dissipating foam head. lots of grain flavor. its infinitely better than budweiser.
2600,Coors Banquet,3.05,pushing 18 years on this site and i’ve never reviewed this beer before let alone ever had one. i’m in colorado now and this may as well be the official beer from here as it’s pure rockies down to that whole mountain water thing…  golden just like it’s origin as it was straw in hue bubbly enough and left enough lacing behind to stay on par with the foam that never fully dissipated from the surface. adjunct corn and cream were in the nose as the taste was equally sweet filling and quasi-artificial. plenty clear and crisp from the water this was plenty old-school and colorado - down to the 1936 stubby bottle that this was served in.  enough carbonation was in this to keep it lively as this oddly reminded me of genesee cream ale. that was a staple of yesteryear back east as this would fit that bill had i grown up in these parts. no this won’t win any awards but it’s worthy enough to have “banquet” on the label as it’s a true original. worth a go once for anyone looking to have a true all-american beer!
2601,Coors Banquet,4.5,fantastic beer. its a major brewery for a reason. no it wont make the beer snobs happy but i dont enjoy 15-20 bucks for a 6 pack of ipas. 9 bucks for a 6 pack of the iconic stubby bottles? im in. tastes great. a little like banana bread to be honest. i dont know why this gets such low marks. crisp great tasting and cheap? count me in! make beer accessible again!
2602,Coors Banquet,3.38,i’m a beer snob however this beer is drinkable. it’s good cold and on a hot day. ratings are to low..
2603,Coors Banquet,3.54,pour very light pale crystal clear white sudsy head that falls and leaves rather quick to leave nothing but a thin ring.  nose is lightly sweet somewhat syrupy faint grain and faint hop presence i want to say floral but they are so faint.  taste is same lightly sweet malt that the nose showed again somewhat grainy; lightly hoppy finish.  prickly and bright on the tongue; light bodied goes down incredibly well; what’s nice is despite all the lightly sweet it finishes quite clean and dry.  a pretty well crafted macro aal quite tasty imo.
2604,Coors Banquet,3.34,look: pale yellow with a frothy white head that quickly forms and begins to settles ending as a pillow and leaving spotty lacing behind aroma: steeped cereal grains wafts of floral hops straw baking biscuits and soda crackers taste: starts off with cereal grains and crackers closely followed by light and subtle floral hop notes that mix in well. some straw and biscuit appear throughout and closes as it started mouthfeel: light but not too watery clean medium-high carbonation and crisp and clean on the finish overall: in case you’ve been living under a rock in beer land and never had coors original before it’s an aal that does what it is supposed to do – refresh quench and not bring too many ‘flavors’ to the table. this does just that and isn’t bad in a sea of aals that contains plenty of awful ones
2605,Coors Banquet,4.01,very nice drinkable and considerable at 5%
2606,Coors Banquet,3.5,look - clear pale straw small white head dissappeared very quickly zero lacing smell - fruity banana taste - sweet fruit banana malty feel - light body well carbonated crisp overall - shes drinkable and probably one of the better american adjunct lagers available. sweet fruit and banana on the flavor with a lingering sweetness. its well carbonated and crisp too. im not going out of my way for it but it was nice to revisit. of course i was jamming to east bound and down by jerry reed. a tip of the cap to snowman and fred. hammer down!
2607,Coors Banquet,3.25,12oz stubby bottle. best by stamp on bottle is oct0923. clear pale gold colored body. one finger of white head which disappears quickly leaving an active surface storm and thin ring. leaves behind a few scattered lacing spots. aroma is kind of green apple fruity with a toasted malt base. taste is white bread green apple and corn with a touch of sulfur at the end. aftertaste has a little spice and quite a bit of malt. thinner mouth feel but not watery. minor tongue sting. very good carbonation. its a beer thats refreshing but not very rewarding on flavors. easy sessionable brew.
2608,Coors Banquet,4.56,my two favorite california ipas bit the dust this year so its time for me to go back to good old coors banquet still my favorite of the american mega brewery lagers. here in the western usa coors banquet was one of the staple beers of the twentieth century. every grocery store quickie mart and gas station has it. the taste hasnt changed a bit during the decades that i have known it. banquet is still brewed only at the golden colorado brewery. the only question for me was should i buy cans or the 1936 stubby bottles? i taste tested comparing bottles with a best by date three months into the future side by side with cans dated four months into future. both containers had the same two-day stay in the refrigerator so they would have equal temperatures (36° f). the coors banquet in the 1936 stubby bottle was the decisive winner. no question about it. from the bottle i could smell distinct spiciness of hops which was barely noticeable from the can. carbonation bite on the tongue was lively with the bottled brew and a bit dull from the canned. finally the malt was more full and sweet from the bottle. glass makes a big difference whether it\s ipa or american adjunct lager. coors banquet in glass easily beats my second choice lager: modelo especial in glass.
2609,60 Minute IPA,3.97,a great drinking ipa
2610,60 Minute IPA,4.39,pours a bright near clear orange golden with a finger and a half of foamy white head. nose is a bright explosion of citrus hops floral piney notes with a tiny hint of weedy dankness. taste follows with citrus - orange sweet grapefruit - almost juicy but with floral notes piney resin and a really nice soft bitterness balancing a cereal malt sweetness. exceptionally balanced medium mouthfeel - so smooth - gulp-able - with a bittersweet finish. historically great and still great.
2611,60 Minute IPA,4,i tried this beer a very long time ago as well as the 90 minute imperial ipa. for some reason the brewmaster at dogfish head thinks their ipas need to be more and more malty. the 90 minute used to taste hoppy and now it tastes completely malty and toasted. now the 60 minute version is ruined. cant figure out why these beers started out very hoppy but are now malt dominant. the brewmaster is an idiot in my opinion. these beers arent horrible but they are not at all what they once were. the bm can go screw himself in my opinion. he must not like hops or something stupid like that. screw him!
2612,60 Minute IPA,3,it’s a good ipa but not a great one. i don’t particularly like ipas but i can recognize quality in the style even if i don’t enjoy it. this one is good possibly very good for how widely available it is but it’s not a memorable one.
2613,60 Minute IPA,5,from an idiot beer drinker with no expertise at all this is the perfect ipa. exactly what i want when i want an ipa.
2614,60 Minute IPA,3.43,ive been a big fan of this beer since it was first produced but the last two times i tried it (on tap at different bars) i was very disappointed. it had a pronounced malt taste but without the hoppy edge that made it great. so i ordered other ipas that i always thought were good competition to the 60min and they didnt disappoint. i hate to see the change in 60min as i wont buy it the was it is. id like to know if any of you also experienced what i have?
2615,60 Minute IPA,4.17,a smooth drink showing light amber color. a complex taste with moderate bitterness.
2616,60 Minute IPA,4.65,no need to break this down! this gets a high score from everyone including me myself for a reason yup it’s that good! my favorite ipa by a long shot. it’s the perfect balance of what we want in a ipa! if you’re a lush like l am it is perfect summertime crusher with a relatively low 6% abv! one of my top 5!
2617,Great,4.04,12oz. bottle served in a spiegelau snifter. vintage is probably circa 2014. pours the color and clarity of unpasteurized apple cider (perhaps a hue darker). not he just a thin broken band around the shoulders. nose is robust - big hit of figs followed by ethanol and perhaps a trace of oxidation/soy sauce in the background. taste consistent with nose - figs are a bit more candied in the flavor profile. middle is earthy with a suggestion of chocolate and finishes with prunes and a light medicinal bitterness. mouthfeel is medium in body with a still carbonation. overall a little past its prime. not much of a suggestion of the barrel; however still quite drinkable.
2618,Great,4.44,2013 vintage; consumed on 3/23/2022  pours a stunning pitch-chestnut an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap expansive frothing collar and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.  aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum refining focus to fig subtle caramel and toffee over time as an evocative dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close.  taste opens to layers of sugar plum raisin dates and bits of brown sugar growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing.  mouthfeel shows a medium body dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish.  belying most any sense of experiencing time and age this is a rich comprehensive american barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits calm barrel inflection and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming classic apex of the style.
2619,Great,3.56,canned 11/02/2020.
2620,Great,4.6,2020 in a can. very hoppy for a barleywine. toffee/bread and moderate amount of barrel
2621,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.15,2022 bottling in a 22oz bomber. shared with the mrs. my serving in a snifter. no abv listed on the bottle.  appearance: black and letting no light through but very dark brown by the time i got to the bottom of the glass. thin tan head with some islands of lacing noted.  smell: mostly bourbon. after warming it up quite a bit i got some additional vanilla something metallic and a hint of roasted malts. still mostly bourbon.  taste: strong bourbon flavor - really dominates the rest of the beer. some vanilla roasted malts a bit of dark chocolate sweet malt and lightly bitter finish.  mouthfeel: good thickness light carbonation but quite warming from the alcohol.  overall / drinkability: im guessing this beer is variable abv each year and this version was on the high side. i could feel it halfway through the glass. pretty hot overall and i suspect it may have mellowed out if i let it sit a year. otherwise good but not great. far too much bourbon and the underlying blackout stout i know so well is lost under all the bourbon.
2622,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.12,22oz bottle labeled 2022 poured into a tulip pint glass at just above fridge temp no abv listed on label. the beer pours the darkest brown possible with minimal light penetration and light brown head. the head recedes to a thin ring and scattered tiny bubbles. the aroma is mild with bakers chocolate oak and coffee. the taste is bittersweet roasted malt with notes of charred barrel dark chocolate and slight bourbon. minimal to medium bitterness. the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with low carbonation and a semi dry finish. overall good. the low carbonation really throws this beer off. theres not enough barrel or abv to counteract the sweetness with no carbonation causing it to feel syrupy and unbalanced.
2623,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.35,22 ounce bottle 2022 vintage didnt see an abv on the label. nice to see this one finally get distributed! served in a snifter the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. head retention and lacing are both good. i like the aroma the brew smells like burnt/charred malt vanilla dark chocolate coffee and some bourbon. taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of some oak dark fruit and earthy flavors. barrel character shows up more in the flavor. mouthfeel/body is medium/full its slick and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. i thought this was a good barrel aged brew certainly worth picking up some if you get the chance!
2624,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.44,from the tap @ great lakes brewpub; cleveland oh; christmas eve 2022.
2625,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4,how does the abv lower if ifs aged in a barrel?... anyways. this was really good to me still but honestly underwhelming. nowhere near the same flavor nuances as the og but im liking that one less too. weird. i also dont understand how the ba version is somehow lower in abv than the original.
2626,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.34,at the cincinnati beer fest 2022
2627,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,3.99,look - really nice black and thick with a nice tan head and lacing smell - coffee chocolate taste - coffee chocolate slight barrel and toasted malts feel - medium body with medium light carb overall - pretty basic and a little thin
2628,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.14,2015 vintage 12oz bottle poured into a tulip  a- pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that has short retention  s- plenty of roast on the nose with some wet ash chocolate and licorice. a bit meaty with raisin and fig. oaky bourbon undertones  t- chocolate and charred malt up front complimented by some raisin and licorice. mid-palate brings out a big barrel note adding barrel juice wet oak and a peppery note. the finish continues with more oaky barrel before lingering with chocolate and char  m- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a slightly warming finish  o- a solid straight up stout with some nice barrel notes throughout
2629,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.48,my god this is certainly one of my favorite beers. i was never a big stout guy until i tried this. unbelievably rich in flavor and texture. poured into a regular beer glass incredibly dark with a great tone.
2630,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.78,ive always really liked this beer and find myself wishing that i had access to it year round. i love the bready maltiness and there is a bit of caramel sweetness to it that i like. its got a good mouthfeel and is just a super smooth highly drinkable beer. i feel like its just a great reliable beer that never lets me down. recommended.
2631,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.32,i liked it. buy more.
2632,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.94,sam adams octoberfest märzen 5.3% abv. pours clearish brown with a half-finger off-white head. nose is malty and bready. taste follows slightly sweet equally bitter. a bit over-carbonated overall very good.
2633,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.16,i so wanted to enjoy this beer. it’s a personal preference but i was turned off by the roasted malt flavor.
2634,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.11,a malty rendition of the marzen oktoberfest style slightly sweeter than the rest of this field which is fine by me. samuel adams might be one of the larger breweries but they do a good job with crafting this one!
2635,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,5,beautiful dark amber color wunderbar aroma very sweet and delicious!  style: märzen | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 5.3% | rating: 5
2636,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.07,12oz bottle pours a clear light amber-orange color with a dense and thick tan-colored head that fades down at a moderate rate before disappearing. smells of toasted malts and bread. taste is the standard caramel toasted malts hearty bread notes slight sweetness and some grassy hop flavor but the flavor seems to disappear into a watery finish surprisingly fast. small hop bitterness that closes the beer and forms most of the aftertaste. medium body with a moderate carbonation mouthfeel and that out-of-place watery feel.  this would have been a fairly solid märzen but that watery feeling really holds it back. wont buy again.
2637,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.3,sam adams used to make a good oktoberfest beer which is not hard to do. the marzen style is pretty easy to nail. unfortunately it appears that theyve watered down their marzen just as they watered down their boston lager recently. its still a very drinkable beer and would be rated much higher as a pils or a dark lager. but there is virtually no hint of the marzen style in this beer.
2638,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.6,its kind of disappointing that sam adams cannot put together a better octoberfest than this .... mine was from a bottle poured flat smelled pretty decent and certainly tastes like a fast beer .... sam adams is sponsoring the cincinnati octoberfest the second largest in the world. they can do better.
2639,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.77,when i start seeing sa octoberfest in the shelves i know fall is just around the corner. good go-to beer for the autumn. easy to find reasonably priced. great fall session crushable beer. won’t blow your mind but will satisfy you.
2640,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,4.03,great fruity taste but the look in the glass and the artificial smell hinders it. a tweak or two and this could be a classic ipa that is great at hiding the high alcohol content!
2641,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,4.61,i like it it a lot- since i usually do not care for most hop heavy ipas. i am more of a malt heavier beer lover prefer red ales some stouts and porters. i truly enjoyed the fruit forward juice flavor especially in summer. the high alcohol content is a nice bonus!
2642,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,4.4,strong vick pleaser
2643,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,3.48,had voodoo ranger juice force ipa poured from 12-oz. can bottom stamped (apparently) canned on 230622 and (apparently) best by 21dec2023 into tulip pint.  pours cloudy gold with 1-finger near-white head resembling a hefeweizen with decent retention leaving some sketchy lace down the glass. big juicy fruit bubble gum aroma off pour backed by a bit of noble hop spice and slightly ameliorated by some classic pale ale apple aroma as warms. on tasting begins sweet juicy fruit bubble gum like the aroma over a nice smooth light malt base with a bit of that apa apple showing in the flavor before a little herbal hop bite cuts the bubble gum for the finish.  the over the top bubble gum aroma is inherently frivolous and misleading about the serious 9.50 abv of this beer. but at least the alcohol content is serious because otherwise this beer is a clown show.
2644,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,3.19,it’s not as good as the imperial but it’s a solid choice if you like bitter ales. it sneaks up on you so be prepared!
2645,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,1.97,definitely not a real hazy tastes like ethanol with hip essence carbonation is large almost like a mcdonald’s coke. i really do not like this too much alcohol too much orange flavoring too harsh carbonation… kinda not that good. the young folks drink these a lot to get drunk quickly.
2646,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,5,new belgium is my new favorite beer. great job !!
2647,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.16,turbid amber pour and partially cloudy in the glass; yeast sediment; thin patch head white foam. heavy caramel nose; figs; raw white oak; leather. the taste faithfully mirrors the aroma; richer and fuller. heavy sludgy mouthfeel; big residual sugar stickiness; a modicum of alcohol dryness balances the sweetness.  a fine robust and sticky sucker this barley wine style ale packs a delicious punch.  pouring temperature: 51.3 ℉; bottling info: n/a source: local purchase
2648,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.87,12oz bottle into a teku. 2002 vintage so 21 years old. mouth is watering already.  black body deep red wine when held up to the light. loose bubbly head doesnt last long.  aroma beyond enticing. molasses brown sugar dark fruit.  on tasting just wow. sweet with raisin plum molasses brown sugar but this is not cloying at all. incredibly smooth.  mouth just about medium. it seems a little thinner than you would like but i swear it gets thicker as it rolls around the tongue.  finish is warming not a trace of alcohol harshness. sweet but again not cloying. the abv is there of course but you really dont notice it among the flavors.  a magnificent beer one of the best ive ever had.
2649,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.53,this is based off a bottle i had in 2023 which was brewed in 2005. l - looks like typical dark ale muddy and cant see light through. s - smells richly of brown sugar and caramel. complex not excessively sweet. t - tastes sweet and caramely in a familiar way but complex to a point which makes it hard to describe. f - no carbonation. flat substance seems to be drawn from the sweetness and the alcohol content. - in general when i popped this beer i didnt quite know what to expect the flavor is amazing. this is a great aged ale and i know i will be consuming plenty of jw lees harvest limited. what a cool concept.
2650,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.18,2011 vintage 9.6oz bottle  a- pours deep amber in color with a ruby hue razor thin off-white head disappears almost immediately  s- a bit of oxidation up front is followed by aromas of sherry caramel leather peppery tobacco raisins & figs brown sugar and a hint of an almost peat-like smoke  t- caramel malty sweetness up front complimented by notes of sweet sherry red cherries brown sugar & rye bread. the finish gives more malty sweetness and lingers of cherry and faded stale hops  m- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slick mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into the finish
2651,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.73,drunk overlooking the ocean on the father-in-laws deck in january 2023 after having received it way back in february 2022 from @turkeysdrinkbeer. the view and the alcohol might have gotten to me so strap in for the review...  l: pours a rusty orange-brown with little to no head but what does hang around is bright white. a slow languorous stream of carbonation threads its way up the glass around lazy suspended sediment. that the sediment is there at all is due to my inattention while pouring. the beer is 6 years old as i pour it and i should have been more on my game. that all said the beer screams barleywine. it looks thick. it looks rich. it looks like it wants a fire and a pair of wolfhounds at my feet while i drink it.  a: it smells like an old english farmhouse. there are years in the carpet pipe tobacco in the air coal dust by the back door and age seeping deep into everything. theres a strong umami scent - redolent of crushed beetles soy sauce and oxidation. theres booze and old sherry old enough that the liquid has begun to crystalise in the bottom of the bottle. theres marmalade thick and bursting with peel and sitting beside the jar of marmite. this is comfort and warmth cold nights warm fires and old old tweed jackets.  t: first blush is sweet malt quickly gaining an umami edge before the marmalade washes over the tongue. theres an earthy woody bitterness that never stretches itself beyond mild and stays away from anything resembling a new word hop. booze follows mild at first building as it warms and then softens out. theres a whiskey note right at the end as the beer thins after the swallow and a nice warmth in the throat and stomach. everything works in harmony. its not as loud and proud as the nose but it perfectly fits the aural scene and the subtle differences and softening of the taste work brilliantly after the build-up.  m: its as thick as it looks in the glass. if ever a beer needed a spoon - fine old silverware if it please mlord - this one is it. carbonation is an afterthought. the beer rolls over the tongue with almost no carbonic prickle and leaves only the slightest calling card on the way down.  o: this beer is the perfect synergy of nose tongue and eyes. it looks like a barleywine smells like a barleywine and sure tastes like a barleywine. all of those elements build on each other and its the evocative nature of that relationship the building of a sensory pyramid that far outstretches its foundations that make this beer so good. its important to understand this is an english barleywine - there are no screaming hops no face-melting bitterness; instead there is malt shoved proudly front and centre and a nod to classic english condiments lifestyles past and times slower. drink this beer whenever you see it.  cheers! #169
2652,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.91,found a 1997 vintage in our beer fridge. we have no idea where it came from. poured with no head. dark mahogany brown in color. as smooth as can be. no alcohol burn n the after taste. heavy toffee & dark sweet cherry notes. just exquisite. im not a beer judge so my ratings for attributes are really useless. i love it thats all i know.
2653,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.2,bottle of 2011 vintage pours a very deep brown some sediment floaties that settle to the bottom and just a bit of carbonation that settles to a ring. initial smells of brandy and booze repeated smells of apple cider vinegar and some wood. taste is much sweeter than the smell very fruity barleywine mostly apricot and stone fruit slight wood and a bready finish. very surprised by this. smooth abv at 11.5% its worth sipping to unlock more subtle notes of tobacco and leather.  while i wouldnt run out and get more i wouldnt mind trying a fresher vintage to see how it stacks up. cheers!
2654,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.48,20 year old 2002 harvest ale from bottle. very smooth and mellow with lightly burnt butterscotch notes. i’m a big harvest ale fan and think if you’re lucky enough to see it you should snag it.
2655,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.44,2020
2656,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),5,theyve upped the abv in my bottle of 750mls. now at 12.5%. typical barley wine smell heady funky. quite sharp at first then mouthfeel is excellent crisp but also rounded. i am quite sorry that i opened this yet. can only get better. have another bottle.....gonna save it.
2657,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.05,on tap 2011 vintage so quite aged. pours a tawny golden brown color. head dissipated after a couple minutes. smells like apple cider and brandy. tastes like apple caramel sweetness brandy tobacco hints of tawny port toffee raisins fig and plum. really mellowed out after a decade it isn’t harsh at all.
2658,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),3.62,2015 canning (8.4 oz can). consumed at cellar temperature (~55° - guesstimate only but a bit warmer if anything).  appearance is dark orange toward brown slightly hazy with sparse carbonation. very short off-white fizzy head with near zero retention; the head is completely gone with just a thin ring before i can put the camera down and even this ring is gone before i can take a sip leaving a tea-like appearance. no lacing.  fruity aroma. apple. caramel. toffee. figs. brandy. quite nice.  the taste is a bit harsh. (perhaps a 2015 is too young?) citrus rind. alcohol. tobacco. leather. boozy. the citrus rind harshness lends a bit of bitterness and the tobacco earthiness is not a good counterbalance. the fruitiness (other than the rind) has not made an appearance. the alcohol warms my mouth and throat in the finish and aftertaste with the tobacco/rind lingering.  mouth feel has a moderate body and flat feel (no carbonation).  overall vastly disappointing especially given the reputation and price at just under $1/oz. as i noted above perhaps more age will mellow out the harshness. i regret buying two. the other one will remain in the cellar for more years both to allow it to hopefully mellow out and because it will not be at the top of my list to try again.
2659,Duvel,4.03,ive been drinking duvel for years and its an awesome beer. i do have a few observations that id like to share. first it has always had a bit of an astringent (acidic) bitterness on the finish that i dont love compared to other belgian strong ales. ive noticed that acidity tends to calm down a bit if you drink it a bit warmer at cellar temp. this makes a big difference to me. still a world class beer without question and one of the best beer glasses in the industry imho.
2660,Duvel,4.25,it certainly does kick up a generous white head of foam over a clear golden ale. nose is good. first sip is tart a little bitter but holds your interest. overall taste is on the lighter side and more refreshing than i thought it would be. would definitely try again.
2661,Duvel,4.1,pours a straw yellow. lots of foam and that high carbonation carries into the bubbly mouthfeel. its a light belgian the herbs are light but interesting. grapefruit rind and lightly bitter. great for summer.
2662,Duvel,3.51,re reviewing after more beer drinking experience. all duvel creations will always get a 5 for appearance.  aroma is a little musky and fizzy malt almost some banana like a wheat beer. not my favourite aroma i prefer more hops.  taste is much much better than the aroma. so much yeastiness and different flavours and aromas. this is unpasteurized for sure. pasteurization destroys every beer. bitterness dominates followed by a foamy hit that explodes on the tongue and wriggles down the throat into the stomach. you can feel it as it continues its journey.  the taste relies primarily on malt without that much noticeble hops. it has a slight hint of being overtly fermented. a feeling that you will have a really bad headache the next day. other beers dont give me this feeling. i would not want to drink this every day. where as a west coast ipa i would be happy to drink 10 a day. if i could find 10 a day.  i much prefer the equinox but its still good. but its not as good as many west coast ipas or even a chouffe ipa. this doesnt come close. its one of the best commercial beers in the world for sure. but it needs more hops ; )
2663,Duvel,4.19,classic for a reason. consistently good double blonde. fragrant and fresh aromatic ale. classic
2664,Duvel,5,unlike the flowery full of platitudes self aggrandizing pandering and slightly too elegant (if you know what i mean) puffy reviews i will sum up this beer as the bomb. mint. f\ing great!
2665,Smoked Porter,4.49,poured from a 1 pt 6 oz bomber “limited 2022 edition” into a tulip glass.  appearance: very dark brown with a massive fluffy tan head that required multiple pourings to fill the glass as the head slowly receded and left abundant lacing.  nose: dark roast and wood smoke plus a bit of dark dried fruit sweetness.  mouthfeel: medium light adequate carbonation.  attack: chocolate dark roast and wood smoke nicely blended.  finish: bitterness from the dark roast to balance the roasted malt attack.  overall: an excellent brew well deserving of its high rating. it’s also a home run pairing for the (smoked then) braised venison shoulder (hank shaw recipe) we’re enjoying with it for dinner. i’ve purchased this brew before and will every year they brew it!
2666,Smoked Porter,4.17,2022 bottle consumed in 2023. initial nose was overpowering but after letting it breathe a bit is was fine. very dark in color with a tight tan head. nose again after letting breathe for a few seconds was slightly charred. taste was slightly smokey but more like a dark chocolate flavor. smoked beers are not my thing but this was good.
2667,Smoked Porter,4.25,22oz bottle vintage 2022 poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 6.5% abv. the beer pours opaque medium brown in color with light brown head. the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. the aroma is moderate in strength featuring meaty campfire smoke. the taste is strong smoke up front with lesser notes of dark chocolate and ashy roast in the background. moderate bitterness. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. overall straightforward and delicious.
2668,Smoked Porter,3.96,2022 vintage  strangely enough this is one of the first beers i heard talked about on ba when i joined. at the time the thought of a smoked beer seemed foreign to me and i spent a bit of time in my early days of beer trying to find this locally ultimately to never find it and forget about it. so when i saw it in chicago i was suddenly brought back a few years and decided to instantly buy the bottle. let’s see what one of my first wants is all about  pours completely pitch black with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the smoke is huge in the nose but makes for a strange combination with the almost creamy underlying porter. i’m picking up on aromas of charred oak campfire smoke milk chocolate vanilla dark toast brown sugar light earthy hops and burnt caramel  it takes the smokiness a bit too far in taste for my liking but ultimately it’s still enjoyable. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting beechwood smoke charred oak milk chocolate raisin dark toast and molasses. the swallow brings notes of campfire smoke charred oak acrid coffee burnt sugar molasses and light milk chocolate  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a slick yet smoky beer. finishes mostly dry  well i finally had it. is it good? yeah. amazing? no it’s not quite balanced enough to say that but it was nice to finally try it. it’s funny that this is my third review in a row that is a smoked porter and despite it being a long time want i eated it the lowest of the three
2669,Smoked Porter,3.99,2022 vintage:  poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter.  look- black medium brown frothy head opaque no visible particulate average head retention slightly below average lacing.  smell- alder oats medium strength of scent.  taste- alder oats slight cocoa medium strength of flavor.  feel- medium body slightly below average carbonation moderately silky mildly creamy moderately bitter.  overall- black with a medium brown frothy head and average head retention. bouquet was pleasant but dominated by alder smoke scent and simple. the taste was also dominated by alder smoke and was just a touch harsh. feel was medium bodied with mild creaminess and moderately bitter. overall this was an enjoyable beer but i think it would have benefited from some age to mellow out some of the smoke character.
2670,Smoked Porter,4,2021 version. pours a deep brown with a medium head and almost no lacing.  the smell is pretty strong chocolate and smokiness.  the taste has strong smoke up front with a big char taste on the finish that lingers.  the mouthfeel is medium/thin medium carbonation with a long smoky charred finish.  overall a very enjoyable although strong tasting beer.
2671,Smoked Porter,3.87,near jet black body that allows no light penetration. tan one finger head. light aromas of roasted malt and smoke. dry bitterness on the tongue with roasted malt and delicate smoke. i thought the mouthfeel was a bit on the light side with above average carbonation. a well constructed porter.
2672,Smoked Porter,3.75,2019 vintage. a bit of bitterness from the hops or roasted malt that i think is excessive and conflicts with the smokiness.
2673,Smoked Porter,4.36,from a large format bottle purchased and consumed on premises at the alaskan brewing public house in juneau. this beer is probably underrated. don\t let the smoke deter you from trying this beer. 4.5  a - pours with a two finger tan head with reddish highlights. black opaque beer. excellent lacing. photo worthy. 4.5  s - slightly smokiness in the nose. 4.0  t - a nice dry english porter with good burnt bitterness. smoke is evident but moderate. faint faint malty sweetness. dark chocolate but it’s about the bitterness. there’s some depth of taste as well as the beer warms. the smoke swirls with the roasted malts to create a nice flavor. 4.5  mf - some acrid bitterness on the back of the palate in the finish. 4.25
2674,Carlton Draught,2.51,$6.50 aud per 570ml pint at paddys irish pub port douglas australia.  innocuous little brew hitting on 6-row minerality and some buttery notes but little else. lacks overt hop flavour or any malty richness.  suffers from subdued though present metallic off flavour.  not much good for anything save quenching thirst in the queensland heat but not terrible for what it is.  overcarbonated. not unrefreshing. a bit creamy.  high d+ / not recommended  *** 12/30/22 middy as part of a $20 aud steak + fry + beer deal at beaches bar airlie beach australia.  ive had worse and this is relatively innocuous.  c- / below average
2675,Carlton Draught,1.89,can best by june 29th 2019.  it pours a clear gold with an ample head of foam.  big corny notes in the smell hints of vegetables wee bit of bitterness.  taste is below that of xxxx gold. too much cornvegetal metallic.  body is not better than the xxxx despite its higher abv.  pretty poor beer.
2676,Carlton Draught,2.06,used to be a fantastic beer. on tap is still okish but in bottle the chemical/metallic after taste ruins it. never buying again.
2677,Carlton Draught,1.03,somewhat refreshing and mildly attractive but the strong chemical taste feel and smell ruin this lager.
2678,Carlton Draught,5,i love carlton draught it is one of the best beers in the world. the look smell taste and feel are comparable with any beer in the world. i could and do drink this beer all day. why is carlton draught called an american adjunct lager? if there is such a thing as heaven and if i do make it there one day i imagine breasting the bar having a carlton draught with god while watching the carlton football club win a premiership.
2679,Monster Tones,4.82,this is everything i thought it could be and oh so much more. chocolate dominates the nose and palate for me with smooth bourbon natural vanilla rich coconut and fudge. the mouthfeel is exactly what i expect from mt - positively scrumptious.
2680,Monster Tones,4.77,2022 version poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter at ansaris eagan mn with josh. excellent viscosity and great maple and coffee flavor.
2681,Monster Tones,4.77,share in denver
2682,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.33,2006 vintage.  pours clear mahogany with crimson edging. lively carbonation but a rather short- lived head and zero lacing. dark fruit and red wine in the nose. medium bodied with a slickish oily mouthfeel. dried plums dark cherries red apples on the palate. finishes nicely tart with an acidity perfect for the depth of character.
2683,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4,2007 vintage; drank 3/3/23 @ owen & engine.  opaque purple/red appearance.  no head; no lace.  balsamic vinegar vanilla & red cherry notes in the nose.  medium mouthfeel.  balsamic vinegar & vanilla flavors; tart red cherry notes on the finish.  odd but somehow pretty good? love to try one fresh sometime...
2684,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.2,375ml bottle into a tulip. 2015 vintage 7 years old.  dark reddish plum body with no head until the last pour which turns the body muddy brown.  light tart aroma.  this one comes under the heading dont judge a book by its cover. the look and faint aroma didnt promise much but the taste certainly delivered. strongly sour and tart lots of dark skinned fruit sweetness buzzes in and out. abv invisible could not believe its an 11.0.  mouth closer to medium than full finish a fruit laden drying sourness.  overall excelled flanders red. sorry i went with the smaller bottle.
2685,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.25,2019 bottle poured at fridge temp but allowed to warm for a while (serving temp is 61 to 64 f). pours a dark orange/light brown with zero head. the nose is intense and insanely good. tons of sour and funk. tart. sour cherries peaches red wine lemon floral and rhubarb.  the taste is really interesting. the lack of carbonation really makes it punch hard. tart cherries lemon peel funk sour oak red wine and a slight nutty flavor. really nice. the alcohol is high but not detectable in any way.  mouthfeel is medium bodied - low carbonation and dry. very enjoyable.
2686,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.84,this is my favorite sour hands down. the mouthfeel is reminiscent of champagne despite the slender head and the nose is yeasty with a note of oak. but the flavor is where it truly excels reminding me of a very fine wine tinged with unripened mango. its hard to do it justice with words. i could drink st. good dog all day if i could only get my hands on a regular supply.
2687,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.25,one of my thanksgiving beers. taste was excellent but the look and feel a bit off.  poured into a tulip glass. clear brown color with little head or lacing. smell and taste of dry red wine. oak and warm spice. cinnamon tart cherries. went well with the turkey!
2688,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.23,l: rich burgundy and starts off with a khaki head s: whisky sour mash caramel and wild flowers t: cherries tangy malt and molasses f: good carbonation and mouthfeel  my main issue with this is that you call definitely tell this is an 11% beer. its about as subtle as a smack to the face. otherwise quite delicious.
2689,Coors Non-Alcoholic,3.22,poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of grains light malts. taste is the same as the aroma some notes of corn. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall its refreshing and somewhat flavorful considering the abv.
2690,Coors Non-Alcoholic,1.84,i dont ever drink non alcoholic beer but i tried a few of them in a lineup recently to asses the best and the worst and next to heineken and buckler this is without question the worst of the three its intolerably bad where the others had some beery redeeming elements this i almost had to spit out. its shockingly sweet has no real malt flavor though at all and doesnt get crisp enough in the finish to fake its way to being a lager like if i wanted a coors and i got this it wouldnt scratch the itch even a little bit the carbonation is the only thing they got right. its awful. i think its cool that there are some craft options for non alcoholic beers now some of them are good too but even still in the macro realm there are a lot better options than this one and i feel sympathy for anyone who is stuck with these. if i was a bar i would carry anything but this as an option. it seems like something they could revisit and improve. im sure its only a small fraction of their business but they really should this is a turnoff of the highest order!
2691,Coors Non-Alcoholic,3.53,clear pale gold with two fingers of white five minute head. good amount of lace. the smell is sweet grain bin. taste is sweet bread dough malt with a tiny note of grassy hops. mouthfeel is thin with strong carbonation. the finish is dry and sweet. overall a good looking beer with just a hint of beer character.
2692,Coors Non-Alcoholic,1.95,coors non-alcoholic served in a pint glass  look: straw color with brilliant clarity. head is bright white with great head retention and a meringue-like head with small bubble texture.  smell: high levels of bready yeasty malt aromas that are followed up by moderate levels of sulfur presumably from the bottom fermenting lager yeast. seems somewhat high for a lager however. no detectable hop aromas which causes the beer to smell overly malty similar to old/stale beer.  taste: bready malt flavors followed by the yeast flavor. low levels of hop bitterness with a low level of grassy spicy hop flavor. hops are barely detectable. sulfur and dms flavors are low to moderate. more moderate as the beer warms. balance is all malt (bready) and fermentation character (yeast sulfur dms). not a pleasant drinking experience.  feel: moderate levels of carbonation. light bodied. no lingering harshness or creaminess. no alcohol warmth (obviously). mouthfeel is typical of adjunct lager style.  overall: beer looks good and the mouthfeel is typical but the aroma and flavor are pretty terrible. i wouldnt drink this unless i had to. best bet is to find a better non-alcoholic beverage.
2693,Coors Non-Alcoholic,2.66,comparing only na beers bud light and miller lite not my favorite sierra nevada pale ale. the color was a nice straw yellow. this na beer poured with a 2 finger head that disappeared quickly. it gave off a nice light beer aroma from the head. the taste was that of beer malt and hops flavored seltzer water. the overall taste and body was that of miller lite without any corn taste.
2694,Coors Non-Alcoholic,4.61,i travel a lot for my sons high school athletics and enjoy a few good beers when i get home. sometimes it takes a couple of our and do not want to risk a dwi. i found the coors na on the shelf and thought i would give it a try. i was blown away with the taste. i could not believe how great it tasted for a na beer. it totally satisfies my craving for the beer taste without the alcohol in my system for driving. the only problem i have is finding it. i was just in walmart and bought the last 6 pack. will buy more if i can find it.
2695,Coors Non-Alcoholic,3.04,coors n/a really catered to my tastes with a bread-like light taste. it was a crisp smooth and overall pretty nice experience. ive tried alot of nas on the market and this was definitely one of my favorite.
2696,Coors Non-Alcoholic,2.25,a-pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing a-aroma has slight malt hints t-the taste follows the nose with a slight malt flavor m-a light bodied well carbonated beer o-a decent beer
2697,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.21,gold hue not much of a head some lace. aroma is dank resin and hops. taste is bold -- 50% wheat malt 50% washington state variety hops. floral not fruity with a slight bite followed by a dry finish. a good one!
2698,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.15,mostly clear slightly hazy copper. white head. good retention and lacing.  mango orange grapefruit pine.  candied mango papaya grapefruit orange zest brown sugar and pine.
2699,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.85,possibly my very favorite beer of all. i love everything about it the refreshing taste the smooth feel the golden look. cheers!
2700,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.5,great beer. im not a huge fan of wheat beers in general but this is a fantastic example of what is possible when using wheat. it somehow beats out the standard lagunitas ipa for taste.
2701,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.98,i guess the first question would be ... how to classify it. maybe its the sumptin kicking in but it may be lagunitass answer to the pilsner being the classic summertime ale - although it also pairs well with the evening campfire. easy going down nice drinkability - third bottle tastes as good as the first doesnt get boring (bought a 12-pack ca local to take camping - not sure if its being produced in another states facility). id buy it again for summertime outings nice malt flavor as well.
2702,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.06,pours a clear copper color with a thin off white head. swells sweet and floral not overly fruity. taste is balanced with a dry bitterness. clean finish with a bit of a chalky feel.
2703,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.91,pours a clear rich gold light head formation and spotty lacing. nose is resinous dank and spicy up front with a secondary note of juicer citrus (primarily grapefruit) some light tropical notes (dried mango) and bazooka. very well-balanced. taste isnt nearly as bitter or resinous as expected. instead this plays on the sweet side with a candied citrus feel up front as well as notes of roasted barley and spice early. mid-palate theres some mildly bitter hop but not too much. mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth without coming across as heavy and preserves some prickly carbonation as well. wish this was more bitter (but thats just me); otherwise a very good affordable and available beer.
2704,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.39,bought this the first time on reputation of brewery and was not disappointed ☹️. just a very easy to drink brew. there’s a lot going on with this but it all works well. heck i even bought another six pack.
2705,Sapporo Light Beer,2.25,i had sapporo premium light
2706,Sapporo Light Beer,2.93,poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of grains malts. taste is very mild some light grains. feels light bodied in the mouth and overall is mediocre. i would say its really no better or worse than most beers in this style.
2707,Sapporo Light Beer,3.38,from the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no bottling or best by date shown. this one is brewed in the usa. sampled on august 18 2017.  the look is pale yellow great clarity and a quick lasting burst of fizzy white head then nothing.  for a light adjunct this has some aromatic qualities including corn rice sweetness and grassy hops.  the body is thin and watery however.  the taste also brings out a pleasant enough corn and rice sweetness. not the syrupy kind. with a clean crisp and slightly zingy grassy finish. i/m not a light beer fan but this one is easy to consume.
2708,Dark Lord,4.43,ba beer #2300  brewers notes: a demonic russian-style imperial stout brewed with coffee mexican vanilla and indian sugar this beer defies description. available one day a year in april at the brewery: dark lord day.  vintage guide: black wax wrapped label = 2020  bottle received in bif17 courtesy of @ovaltine  room temperature bottle poured into a pretentious beer glass. dark cola brown liquid little foam  settles to a ring  aroma is coffeemolasses brown sugar tobacco  taste is coffee dark fruits raisins tobacco char  port wine  sudsy mouthfeel lighter than i expected  boozy  good beer reminds me more of a barley wine than a ris
2709,Dark Lord,4.27,2009 vintage. poured from a bomber into a snifter.  impenetrable seal brown/bistre liquid with a faint almond event horizon. vague collar never quite awakens. thick sheets of legs.  molasses port cherries cocoa and char in the nose. more fruit as the ale warms.  prunes cherries and port are forward on the palate. vinous quality persists with a background of dark malt black licorice and faint chocolate. blackberries violets dulce de leche ash clay and figs. some oxidation is leading this into old ale territory but no cardboard or other off notes. low bitterness medium-sweet linear finish.  oily slick carbonation has faded though there is some life left.  after 14 years this has evolved into something difficult to categorize and in some ways closer to a fortified dessert wine than a ris.
2710,Dark Lord,4.36,a 22 fl. oz. bomber 2015 vintage very nicely maroon waxed poured into a snifter glass.  appearance: black in colour with only a thin brown head and sparse spotty lacing.  aroma: coffee dark fruit plum prunes fig molasses oak chocolate light roast.  taste: sweet dark fruit charred notes plum prunes fig cherries brown sugar molasses chocolate coffee burnt sugar.  mouthfeel: full bodied with soft carbonation.  overall: a nice warming sipper. maybe approaching too sweet but the charred and burnt notes do sort of keep it in line.
2711,Dark Lord,4.32,2014 dark lord. zero carbonation on the pour. thick. nose is roasted malts black licorice a touch of soy sauce some nice dark fruit (cherries plums) and some toffee. the taste is fantastic. no soy sauce here. big roasted malts sweet toffee chocolate licorice maple oak tons of dark fruit - blackberries raisins plums. sticky and creamy. just lovely. definitely going to sip on this for a long time.
2712,Dark Lord,4.14,pours a viscous-looking garnet-hued black with a fat finger of dark khaki head that settles into a lasting crown and leaves no lacing.  umami chocolate red wine and toffee in the nose.  sweet and vinous tasting up front. vanilla and fig in there too. loads of umami and some bakers cocoa balance that right out. a kiss of warming alcohol in the backend.  thick and chewy feel.  well crafted and smooth. 2019 bottling.
2713,Dark Lord,4.42,pours a deep dark brown with moderate cappuccino head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a thin ring around the edge of the glass.  big aromas that burst from the bottle upon opening. sweet milky coffee dates stewed fruits. a little charred food sits in behind.  sweet vanilla hits the tongue first. it’s followed by coffee much milder dates/figs/raisins. the sweetness stays for the duration but isn’t over the top or unwanted. again in the background there is a charred food/ashy quality that i like. not boozy in the least.  this is a big bodied beer. thick without verging too far into syrupy territory. long finish.  i really enjoyed this beer i’ve heard about for so long. very glad to have tried it.
2714,Dark Lord,4.34,2015 maroon wax. black with small head. nose has umami notes charcoal grill in a good way. taste more chocolatey and sweet molasses booze fig cocoa powder. big body and low carb. 7 years old and amazing.
2715,Curiosity Twenty Seven,4.52,2 months old. can to wine glass.  l: pours a full and hazy orangeish yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. some very tiny floaters visible.  s: sweet and hoppy with notes of candied citrus fruits paired with bubblegummy strawberry notes.  t: grapefruit orange and lime. strawberry and peach as well. hoppy and grassy. less sweet than its taste with a bitter finish.  f: full and juicy almost creamy. quite sharp. medium carbonation  o: nice balance of fruity and grassy as well as sweet and bitter notes. classic th with a sharp twist. great beer.
2716,Curiosity Twenty Seven,4.44,canned on 3-7-2023 consumed on 4-2-2023  poured from the can. the color is quite hazy murky and juicy looking. no light comes through when held up to the light. the head that this beer produces is 2 finger white and frothy looking. the head retention is decent and theres a ton of lacing on the glass. the aroma is quite dominated by the hops. it is juicy smelling. i get mango grapefruit and pineapple on the nose. the flavor is very juicy and has the flavors i mentioned in the aroma. theres a bit of mango up front that fades to the grapefruit and pineapple on the back. these latter flavors really linger on my taste buds and in my throat. heck i will be burping pineapple and grapefruit for a while. the body feels quite full soft feeling and juicy. i am fairly burnt out on this style however when its done right i love it. this is done right.
2717,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3,tastes horrible and gives you a rougher hangover than the other ice beers. that being said at 10 dollary doos for a 15pk even in today’s nightmare world timeline the beast ice is a winner in my book.  style: ice lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 5.9% | rating: 3
2718,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.75,poured from a 16oz can into a mug. pours a fairly clear straw gold with a quick-to-fade white foam. pretty musty on the nose but a little better in the taste. it’s not the most offensive beer i’ve ever had by bar but it’s definitely a one and a done. mouthfeel is decent - fuller and actually quite smooth. been a long time since i’ve wet my whistle with this one. i’d revisit again on a regular basis. the “heavy” beers like this are just tough. more than one and you’re just asking for trouble.
2719,Milwaukee's Best Ice,2.25,pours out of the can a crystal clear gold with a fizzy head with surprising lacing. smells like malt and maybe corn. taste follows the nose pretty much its really not bad. decent carbonation and goes down pretty smooth. cheap beer that doesnt hurt anybody
2720,Milwaukee's Best Ice,5,best lager in stores. the cost to buy it has tripled in last several months. i cannot afford it anymore. my neighbor and i would love to drink more of it. we are old and dont drive
2721,Milwaukee's Best Ice,2.84,poured from a 32 oz can best buy february 13th 2023.  on the poor a threefinger 3 finger white and very fizzy head was present. surprisingly decent retention with retention with it only dissipating to about one finger after a couple minutes.. the body is a golden a golden color a bit darker than standard aal. fine lively carbonation carbonation and it tries to lace  aroma is a bit rough on this one. and. lots of assetelda hide green apple smell thats just a bit off mixed with a is corny light malt. a bit chemically like fusel alcohol like a lot of ice beers are.  the acetyl to hide comes through on the taste as well again with the light corning malt and a bit of sweetness although it isnt overwhelming. for the most partless beer is pretty drinkable.  feels just a bit too big to be a refreshing aal and a bit too syrupy to be a nice bigger lager. still for the abv its easy to put down.  overall this is just about what i expected from this beer but honestly it exceeded my very low expectations. not as bad smelling as a few of the other cheapos ive grabbed and its drinkable if not just a bit syrupy feeling.
2722,Milwaukee's Best Ice,2.4,tastes of mothers milk
2723,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3,ill admit msbest may not be the best tasting beer on the planet but it is cheap cold and refreshing. after ive mowed the yard it damn well hits the spot and ill sure as heaven take msbest over any ipa or craft beer. drink on beer lovers!!!!
2724,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.52,look.its a cheap ice beer.the cheapest around.back in the daywhen the wife and i had three nickels to our namewe would go across the street to the gas station and buy a six-pack and drink it with our grilled cheap steak and onions and life was grand.it was awesome. andyou know what?drink this stuff ice coldand thirty-five years laterlife is still grand.i love ipas and belgian anythings more than any human on earthbut a cheapice cold milwaukees best ice or premium still tastes like it should. as for you nose in the air micro-snobs who wouldnt be caught near one of these...i hope i never meet you.
2725,Milwaukee's Best Ice,1,drain-pour!
2726,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.62,for the price its a good flavored (best ice) with extra kick of alcohol.
2727,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.2,very hot day corner store. just wanted some cold beer to take down to the lake. store had 3 beers to pick from. four 16oz. cans of milwaukees best ice for $2.75. why not. took the lawn chair out of the trunk and snapped open a cold one. i was surprised this beer was much better than i was expecting. especially after all the negative comments i’ve heard about it prior. good alcohol content good taste great price i like this beer i’ll be keeping it in my shop beer fridge.
2728,Exponential Hoppiness,4.4,from a month-old pint can pours a very clear darkish-gold. small white head with little lacing as youd expect from this abv. smell and taste are classic west coast ipa with pine and honey malt in balance. good hit of bitterness in the finish. no trace of alcohol medium feel. great beer.
2729,Exponential Hoppiness,4.37,notes from 12/20/2019  on tap in a half pint snifter at the draft house austin texas. look is golden and a little cloudy. there is almost no head because the staff pour carefully to the brim to give you more beer. 4.25 smell is hops citrus stone fruit and a little spice. 4.00 taste is mango citrus alcohol some malt pine and moderate bitterness. 4.5 feel is medium and a little slick. 4.5 overall it is a big ipa with a lot going on. its too much for me to drink it offten but it is a great beer. 4.5
2730,All Day IPA,4.2,lower abv (4.75%) but good taste. great for all-day affairs. 15 cans for 12 pack pricing - can’t go wrong. as good as other local ipas and much better than any major brand.
2731,All Day IPA,3.86,clear deep gold with white head great retention thin rings of lace floral citrus and pine hop aromatics a bit sweet malt underneath toasty sweet malt followed by citrus and pine hop flavors light bodied appropriately carbonated i could actually drink this all day along with an equal amount of water.
2732,All Day IPA,3.75,the taste is good and rich belying its low abv. a great choice when you need to carry on with the day.
2733,All Day IPA,4.16,lovely sticky fresh hop-forward smell. bitter in a good way. just enough bready-malty flavor at the end to balance. aftertaste has some tropical fruit. mouthfeel is nice and as light as youd expect with its low abv. great to get so much hop flavor packed into something with a 4.7% abv. while this isnt my favorite ipa i cant think of another ipa under 5% i like more.
2734,All Day IPA,3.58,odd i never have reviewed this beer. i think i should have waited to have it from draft instead of from an individual can from total wine.  poured into a tulip glass. clear yellow color with a brief foamy head with some curtain lacing. fruity smell and taste. dank and bitter but seemed a bit stale. it wasn’t bad with the pizza.
2735,All Day IPA,3,15 pack purchased from a local food lion. upon opening the 12 ounce (355 ml) can it was poured into a glass. poured a deep amber with a nice head of foam. looks like beer smell was grains malt maybe some pine tasted like beer. smooth and not at all bitter. not sure about the ibu rating. mouthfeel was smooth but not at all watery overall...this ipa is a work of art so to speak. refreshing and well crafted. [i do think i like the bourbon barrel stout a bit better though]. kind of reminds me of a good brew from queensland. only made in america. i would hughly recommend this beer.
2736,All Day IPA,3.77,pours deep clear gold. mild carbonation small frothy head. mild mannered in smell and taste. hippiness and mild florals come through. fresh and quaffable easy like sunday mornings. love the packaging also. always adds to the experience.
2737,All Day IPA,4.06,canned: 04/27/23  l: pours a pale to deep gold color with excellent clarity. the pours gives two fingers of frothy off-white head with good retention. as the beer goes down it leaves a nice ringed and webbed lacing on the glass.  s: oranges grapefruit rind grainy pale malt and light notes of dry pine needles. as the beer opens up i also get light notes of caramel malt.  t: this one follows the nose pretty closely. i get oranges grainy and biscuity malt character a bit of pine and a light grapefruit bitterness on the backend and finish.  f: medium body with medium-low carbonation. the mouthfeel is smooth and slick with a light dryness on the finish.  o: this one packs in a lot of flavor for a session ipa. it reminds me of lawsons super session series. easy drinking flavorful and all for a decent price. its not the best ipa in the world but as far as session ipas go it is definitely in my top 10.
2738,All Day IPA,4.21,waited entirely too long before finally trying this only to discover its got a lot going for it for such a low-abv ipa. manages to capture much of the characteristics of a classic apa and is very tasty and solid for its weight class. would happily enjoy again.
2739,All Day IPA,5,this could be the last beer i ever need to drink. a beer you could spend the rest of your life with.  friggen store keeps raising the price though. drive out to nevada and you can still buy the 15 pack for $16 and no recycling crap attached to it. great drinking two of these after two scotches. all you need for a good night besides a good woman.
2740,San Miguel Especial,3.05,spanish brewed version...likely better than the uk one.  rather large bubbles. looks refreshing. aroma of dry malt and some faint hops. i like the bitterness in the aroma.  the malt is far more flavorsome than the majority of pilsners as is common in spain. mahou is far superior but i much prefer this to estrella which for me is mega over-rated. when i was younger i stayed in a holiday resort in ibiza where all alcohol was free and this was the only beer on tap. there were water jugs at our tables so i emptied the water out and walked to where the san miguel tap was. i saw another person with a water jug full of san miguel and smiled at him and said english. he smiled back and said yes ; )  so for about 2 weeks i substituted water for this. its dry reasonably complex and as long as you drink the spanish verion and not a dodgy sub licence one which exist in multiple countries its pretty good. the hops add a dryness with not much flavour however because the malt is flavoursome almost as flavoursome as belgian malt the beer tastes pretty good. unlike some other dry pilsners such as croatian pan and romanian ursus which literally have no taste beyond the dryness.  i didnt used to like this but because of my current location i have had so many terrible beers recently i quite like this. mouth feel is impressive for a pilsner. pretty good overall i like. uk version is terrible though as are some of the other internationally brewed ones. from memory some dont even say where they are brewed ; )
2741,San Miguel Especial,2.92,look - golden clear nice white head smell - grainy taste - grainy clean feel - light body with a crisp carbonation overall - not bad but still lacking depth
2742,San Miguel Especial,2.74,canned in a full pint can and a gift frm a neighbour for helping out pours a fairly clear lemon jello coloured body with decent white head aroma is semolina & candy cigarettes without the sweetness so is the flavour
2743,San Miguel Especial,2.88,sanmiguel especial which come in a standard 330ml bottle with a medium abv of 54%. not to be mistaken with another beer named like that from the philippines.  poured into the guinness it left a two inches white head quickly vanishing as i write this. clear and golden yellow brew.  on the nose it’s pretty dull some hints of floral notes and that’s about it.  on the palate it’s again not opening a pandora’s box of aromas of flavors but that was expected for something i was fearing would be another mediocre industrial euro lager. it’s a bit richer than that. i like the dry finish and drinkability but i wasn’t looking for more from this one.  it’s a medium bodied beer with high carbonation. dry finish and drinks well  overall it’s not as awful as reviewed here or elsewhere. best drink fresh and cold would probably pair really well with españa food but in lack of a chorizo or paella right now not to mention being quite far from the puerta del sol this will be a one and done. ticked reviewed. not a huge aficionado but there are far worse european lager around here.
2744,San Miguel Especial,2.54,440ml can. 5.0% version brewed in the uk by carlsberg.  drank from the can and a glass tastes like copper nails tastes far worse as it warms up very metallic tasting.  drank from a bottle previous times and really enjoyed it.
2745,San Miguel Especial,2.94,this one (54% abv) is far better than their 45% version lager which most people have rated under the philippines branch brewery even though many of us obviously have had it in spain. anyway the 54% version is quite malty with a barely sufficient hoppiness. an acceptable premium lager not great but well worth having with (or without) a meal in spain. this rating is based on a bottle bought in norway had travelled well.
2746,San Miguel Especial,2.5,440ml can. 5.0% version brewed in the uk by carlsberg. l: clear golden colour with many streams of bubbles. excellent head is big white soapy & long-lasting. served in a cold glass with beads of condensation this is exactly how you want a lager to look. s: absolutely nothing. t: sweet & grainy. negligible hop flavour. f: thin mouthfeel almost saved by moderate carbonation. o: incredibly bland. designed to be drunk ice cold. looks great and is well sessionable otherwise poor.  ps. do drink ice cold. this beer becomes sickly sweet as it warms.
2747,San Miguel Especial,3.25,had on tap in barcelona.
2748,San Miguel Especial,3.15,l: -pours a clear golden with a bigfoamywhite head -medium to high carbonation visible s: -honeyspicygrainycornfloral t: -follows the nose f: -medium carbonation -light body o: more malty than most premium lagers.the malt base reminds me a lot of staropramen but with the typical low bitterniss of other premium lagers a drinkableif unexciting premium lager with a heavier malt base than its competitors.
2749,CitraQuench'l,4.91,hazy gold like pineapple juice extremely strong grapefruit smell and taste (also confirmed by my wife). tasty hoppy but not too harsh. pleasant all the way through the sip. very good easy to drink!
2750,CitraQuench'l,4.5,pours a light hazy golden color with a nice head and lacing aroma has generous tropical and citrus hints the taste follows the nose with a well balanced tropical and citrus flavor a medium bodied well carbonated beer a great neipa
2751,CitraQuench'l,4.24,i believe itd rate higher fresher still a tasty beer tho.
2752,CitraQuench'l,4.03,juicy looking pour. the color seems a bit lighter golden. it really looks like a glass of pineapple juice but with a very frothy and fluffy 2 finger white head. the beer has great head retention and theres a good amount of lacing on the glass. to be honest im not getting much on the nose. its a fairly faint citrus hop aroma. taste - theres a citrus flavor to this beer due to the hops and i think its tangerine that im getting from the hops. the flavor from the hops really keeps building in my throat and on my taste buds. the flavor lingers in my throat and i just keep tasting it. the body is juicy and also has a crisp feeling. the hops linger in my throat but they dont feel sticky or like resin. this is a delicious example of the style. the aroma was a bit of a let down it is a bit over a month old so maybe that plays a factor into it. that being said the flavor is there.
2753,CitraQuench'l,4.3,had on tap at the bass lake draft house in holly springs nc.  this was a tasty hazy ipa. not a great amount of head but the hazy appearance and color were good for the style. dank citrus fruit aromas were the outstanding aspect of this beer with the taste almost as good. worth trying if you get the chance.
2754,Thicket,4.24,blend #1 on tap at the cellar. nice and tart. just funky enough. wine barrels did this well. quite enjoyable. would really like to contract with blend #2 eventually.
2755,Moinette Blond,4.45,l: -pours a cloudy deep golden with a medium to bigfrothywhite head -medium to high carbonation visible s: -bananawhite breadcorianderyeastyhoney t: -herbalspicywhite pepperhoneyyeasty -finishes dry f: -medium body -medium carbonation o: damn good and dangerously drinkable blonde .
2756,Moinette Blond,3.64,bottled on: l19013a (whatever that means? im guessing 2019??)  a - pours a hazy somewhat murky medium to dark golden orange color with ultra dense bright white creamy foam resting on top. carbonation is moderate and steady.  s - banana light spice yeasty slightly bready.  t - bready with light spice and citrus. ends on the sweeter side.  m - big medium body with soft prickly carbonation on the tongue.  o - tastes really old wish i could fully understand the criptic bottle date. will revisit another bottle of this if i can find something newer.
2757,Moinette Blond,3.75,cerveza de color ámbar con un dedo espumoso de retención media. de cuerpo y carbonatación media. aroma a levadura banana y caramelo. en boca tiene un poco mas de amargor pero bien matizada con un final dulce.
2758,Moinette Blond,4.18,blind-tasted except for the beers name and brewery/country zero reviews below read (yet!)… l- dark golden with a hint of amber. pours with moderate haze; some encrusted sediment left in the bottle. 2cm pillowy off-white head. s- aromatic leathery timber. ie. belgian estery yeast notes. t- the smell follows through directly into the taste. the estery notes are now clear - they often remind me of the smell of sweets called pear drops we enjoyed as children. plenty of bright hops into the finish to balance thing out too. f- its a good solid beer. the estery notes are really prominent; it would be a great case study if you wanted to demo such to someone unfamiliar with them. o- i like it. mega-esters popping right on your palate. bright interesting and balanced flavour. solid and meaty and yet not even a hint my palate is going to get jaded by this. 60% gone now and the head is still right there holding up at 1cm+. i reckon this is versatile too. works great in winter (its snowing out in london/uk today!) bright enough for a summers eve. robust enough to pair with solidly flavoured food incl spicy food. review/scoring all done now the reveal i get to read the bottle lables to see what i missed! ==> bottle-conditioned 8.5%abv it was politely discreet about the latter. 330ml bottle £4.15 bb: 10/23 bought from belgianbeercompany stoke/uk as part of a large pick-your own consignment to london.
2759,Moinette Blond,3.81,330 ml bottle cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 8.5%. hazy golden colour moderate white head. strong fruity and spicy aroma of belgian ale yeast. spicy and yeasty flavour medium sweet with notes of white kandij sugar and stewed fruits. moderate hops.
2760,Moinette Blond,3.79,gold-colored veiled and with orange reflections. white foam with medium texture compact and excellent grip. perfume bread pear citrus candied sugar ginger spices and herbaceous. on the palate a light sweet entry biscuit and yellow-fleshed fruit the finish is dry with a bitter aftertaste with spicy and herbaceous notes. hidden abv. medium body and high carbonation.
2761,Moinette Blond,4.02,delightful. my first strong belgian pale i think. i usually go for strong dark dubbels and quads. this tastes similar but a tad lighter with a touch more bitterness. nicely sweet and paired well with a roast duck dinner. it was better as it warmed up i think i had it too cold initially. no hint of the 8.5%.
2762,Moinette Blond,4.23,330 ml bottle from the lcbo; best before aug 2022 and served at cellar temperature.  pours a bright clear golden-yellow hue producing just over a finger of foamy sparkling white head. it withers away over the next several minutes leaving behind a thin cap and wide frothy collar with a narrow band of lace also having been deposited. im getting orchard fruits and yeastiness on the nose - appleskin clove and white pepper with hints of banana pear and candi sugar sweetness all layered atop of a bready pale malt backdrop. not bad at all.  a quality belgian strong ale; the flavours follow the nose with grainy bready pale malts providing support for notes of apple white grape apricot and pear. hints of lemony citrus and bubblegum crop up as well with yeasty spicy aspects of clove towards the finish and just a tad of floral hops & earthiness into the aftertaste. medium-full in body with moderate carbonation levels that froth up in the mouth a little gently tickling the tongue; feels smooth and velvety soft in the mouth. the 8.5% is a tad noticeable but not in an intrusive way as it blends into the profile quite effectively. if it werent for the small serving size this might be a much more dangerous beer particularly given the ease with which i tossed it back.  final grade: 4.23 an excellent a-. moinette blonde is a very solid bspa that i enjoyed the hell out of. now i dont know if id put it on the same pedestal as duvel but in terms of quality its at least in the vicinity of that ballpark. the stock around here is beginning to dwindle but hopefully ill manage to pick up another bottle or two for short term (less than 2 y) storage in the cellar. highly recommended to any ba with an appreciation for belgian pale ales.
2763,Moinette Blond,3.77,this is a refreshing beer you taste the belgium style slight hops light citrus malt aroma smooth to the pallet and a nice aftertaste. this is a great belgium pale ale and probably one of the better ones ive had. definitely a summer drink and dangerous for 8.5 abv.
2764,Moinette Blond,3.95,the look is lovely belgian and the nose is equally good funky saison. but the taste is somewhat disappointing. its a bit fizzy haltingly dry and just an overall weaker sister of st. feuillien grand cru to which this seems to inspire but cannot reach. really you could do worse if nothing is available in its class. otherwise....meh.
2765,Moinette Blond,4.1,color of light shimmering gold with white cap and lacing.  a clean aroma of ripe fruits such as apricot pear and peach.  taste is a combination of the scent fruits along with touches of yeast rolls and a bit of spice. cant quite nail down the spice as its very light but cinnamon and clove come to mind. complex sophisticated and quite refreshing.  light to medium texture with balancing carbonation.  in scent texture and taste this is a good deal milder than i usually get from a belgian blond. not de minimis but certainly no block buster.
2766,Moinette Blond,4.26,330 ml bottle served very cool into a chalice. lcbo purchase for about $3.35cdn. best before august 2022.  appearance - hazy rich dark golden color capped with a finger of white head that actually fizzles out much quicker than i thought it would. sparse lacing clings to the edges of the glass.  smell - powdery yeast bready donuts some fruit namely apple pear and peach. inviting and warm. a touch perfumey as well.  taste - light and bready some funky yeast slight bits of candi sugar and more sweet fruits apple and pears most with a peachy sensation. so good and easy to drink.  mouthfeel - medium bodied booze is so well hidden and well carbonation fizzy and expressive without being gassy 8.5% abv is wonderfully hidden.  overall - yeah a strong belgian pale ale brewed by dupont what where you expecting. delicious and inviting its not quite duvel but pretty much the next best thing in the style really should try to do a comparison between this la chouffe duvel and delirium seems like a fairly even 4 way fight for supremacy and what could wrong in that situation?
2767,Loose Cannon,4,12 ounce bottles into a can glass. a maryland go-to malty ipa. it’s a good drinkable choice every time!
2768,Loose Cannon,4.12,tried it while traveling in wv. i will look for it locally.
2769,Loose Cannon,4.02,a heavy malty (not a new england) ipa.
2770,Loose Cannon,4.19,clear deep amber body under a large white head that left good lacing. aroma of floral hops standing out against a backdrop of barley. floral herbal piney hops remain the focus of the flavor. malts add balance without being a distraction. some spiciness in the aftertaste. clean dry pleasantly bitter mouthfeel. a locally made favorite.
2771,Biere De Norma,4.38,look - lobe the auburn clear color with a slight off white head and stickiness smell and taste - nice tart plum woodiness feel - medium body dry crisp carb overall - really nice biere de garde!
2772,Biere De Norma,4.45,bottled 2/23/17  i haven’t had many biere de gardes so when i saw the highest rated example of the style on mbc i knew i had to throw down for it. i also haven’t had much wild or funky stuff from hill farmstead so i’m quite excited for this one. let’s pop it open and see what it’s all about  pours a slightly cloudy orange brown with 2 fingers of light beige head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  its quite punchy in the nose but in a subtle way if that makes sense. im picking up on aromas of wildflower honey orange zest lemon juice earl gray tea wet hay buttery oak petrichor tart cherry white wine vinegar and light apple skin  the taste leans a bit sweeter than the nose led me to believe though theres still a bite to it and its equally impressive. on the front end of the sip im tasting earl gray tea lemon juice tannic white wine buttery oak straw crackery malt earthy wheat light orange zest and pear skin. the swallow brings notes of wildflower honey dark bread earl gray tea apple cider vinegar honeycomb wet hay sharp oak stone light brown sugar and orange zest  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a sharp beer. finishes a tad sticky but the funk dries things out  this is an insanely unique beer. a wild fermented biere de garde. i havent had anything quite like it before. i need more hill farmstead in my life
2773,Biere De Norma,4.38,great beer and great history
2774,Biere De Norma,4.48,largely clear but the full bottle pour lightly hazes up the acorn red to brown-amber body. its dense khaki head settles to a bubbly but persistent blanket with a curled ridge. its quite beautiful really.  hints of cherry skin-like tannin accent the lightly toasted malt even emulating a touch of char. a little ashy leafy and lightly horse blanket-esque funk meets a uniquely spicy bitterness layered within the oak. its an almost a red wine tannin with a touch of cedar.  the medium body contains a firm fluff and finishes just barely dry.  its like the most delicate flanders red ive ever had with no where near the acidity.
2775,Biere De Norma,4.54,750ml bottle - 2018 vintage split with jrc1093 in the car in the woods at a lake in the middle of nowhere western massachusetts.  the waxed cap is a project and it took about 3 hours to open involving a bait knife a hairbrush and some tenacity. upon finally freeing the cap that shiny aluminium bastard came flying off with a most impressive percussive *bang* before travelling at a high rate of speed on a direct route to my forehead drawing blood upon impact. some very prolonged but mimimal foamy gushing - perhaps a tablespoon of ale was lost.  norma poured the most impressive deep reddish-goldish-amber colour with a silky head of unevenly tan foam. some lacing did cling. streaming effervescence is very visible. 4.5  nose: the deep cavernous complex aroma of this ale is hard to describe. pale slightly toasted crackery malt lays a subtle foundation for the explosion of aroma. tons of fermented honey waxy honeycomb brown sugar musty old wet wood lemon zest green apple pear ancient stone cellar composting stone fruit flesh a little apple cider vinegar and some serious serious wild bacterial funk. the funk is so intensely deep earthy musty and wild yet elegant and graceful. this is one you could nose for hours. 4.75  palate: biére de norma greets the palate with a rush of intensity and a level of acidity slightly above what im used to from hill farmstead yet still very balanced and not at all sharp or acetic. tons and tons of honey influence - fermented honey honeycomb raw honey and what i would image ancient black honey dripping down cliff walls would taste like. this does lend a touch of sweetness and hints of caramel toasted sugar and a whisper of molasses all perfectly balanced out by the tart apple cider vinegar zip. a very interesting savoury note appears - not allium but like soil sweat and even a slight...saucy note? this ushers in a sharp turn from honey and tartness to serious mature funk with marmite black truffle way overripe cherry and a hint of washed rind cheese before pulling away bringing honey back into focus along with tons of old wet oak leather wildflower lemon zest apple and white grape finishing with perhaps just a touch of leafy hop character and lingering vinous tarntness. 4.5  mouthfeel/body: in line with the style the beer is slightly more full-bodied than one may expect at 7% abv and the honey does a nice job of lending some roundness as well. the tartness just keep everything snappy crisp and insanely drinkable. effervescence is racy lively and on-par with a good champagne. the oak lends a woody dryness and the balanced acidity leads to a clean dry finish. 4.25  overall: this is simply a beautiful biére de garde. one of those rare beers that just has everything perfectly dialed in and rounded out. like a stone smoothed over by years in the running river there are no edges and every element is flowing and seamless with unfurling complexity and bold character. do not hesitate to seek this one out.
2776,Biere De Norma,5,beautiful looking beer. opens up with an awesome cherry flavor reminiscent of cherry sweet tarts and musty cherry skin complimented by red apple and grape there is a pleasant sweetness with hints of honey and vanilla dancing in there to balance things out. some funky hay and spice characters rounding this one out. excellent offering here - zippy level of tartness cut just perfectly by some mellow sweetness - complex and funky throughout.
2777,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.53,11.2oz bottle best by march 2024. served in a shaker pint glass.  appearance: clear pale gold thin white head with fine sheets of lacing.  smell: mostly clean with a bit of sulfur/skunky note.  taste: clean bready/slightly sweet middle with some noble hop bite at the finish.  mouthfeel: ok thickness a bit fizzy but not badly so.  overall / drinkability: about what you would expect from a euro pale lager. no frills has that skunky note but is easily drinkable. it did pair well with my pasticio and greek salad.
2778,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.27,enjoyed at a local greek restaurant in ft myers fl. green bottle poured in glass. very flavorful with just enough carbonation.
2779,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.75,bottle pour into a tulip glass. clear pale golden appearance with a modest foamy head that recedes quickly to a surface film and collar. grain scallion celery pepper herb anise notes. light body light carbonation soft lively mouthfeel.
2780,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.21,poured from a 330ml bottle.  pours dark yellow with a tiny and fleeting head  smelling of grass with a touch of skunk . the taste is light grassy and mildly sweet with a slight bitterness. mouthfeel is okay  neither good nor bad . overall average but on a hot day would do to cool you down . average.
2781,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2.92,new review because i was drunk last time. cool unicorn on the label.  extra overall marks for the bottle cap. perfect if you are heading for the field school or a war zone like me. but it looks totally average inside a glass great smooth head though.  aroma is a little unique in terms of the hops...definitely different from a western european pilsner. kind of musky and spicy.  mega unified hops and malt. subtle sweet hops. i love it. hops are beautiful so is the malt. quite a complex mouth feel with a taste that gradually gets more bitter as it swirls around. crisp and dry yet still complex. definitely tastes best out of the bottle in hot weather. in general for me greek food products are the most pure and natural of any country cyprus too. the tomatoes and salad in cyprus are simply amazing.  this tastes much much better straight out of the bottle. try ; )  if you want a similar beer that is like this but better try efes pilsner. dont try the efes draft or malt they are terrible.  sorry i dont want to restart any wars but its just beer.
2782,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2.69,green bottle poured into a glass  clear golden liquid occasional carbonation streams  frothy white layer reduces to spotty lacings and a ring  slight grassy aroma  thin lightly flavored lager  grassy  slight sweetness  fizzy mouthfeel fair beer
2783,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2,a very weak lager from greece. nothing exciting here. granted it would be a nice accompaniment to some good greek food. low carbonization and crispness make it drinkable.
2784,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.62,i had a bottle of this with dinner at a local greek restaurant with dinner! went really well with pastitcio!
2785,Labatt Blue Light Lime,4.11,well... this is a unique one. its apparently beer that is flavored with lime. i dont really get the taste of beer coming through.  this is like corona that comes with lime already in it except its an interpretation by labatt. it has a nice scent to it.  the lime flavoring tastes a bit artificial but im guessing they just put the type of lime juice youd find at the store that comes in the green plastic lime bottle intinto it.  not the best but not the worst. if you like corona with lime you might like this.
2786,Labatt Blue Light Lime,2.89,pours very pale yellow with a 2 inch white head. moderate lacing.  strong aroma of lime smells sweet.  taste is lime not much else.  light bodied thin and watery. very little carbonation. dry slightly bitter finish.  not bad for a light beer albeit not as good as labatt light grapefruit.
2787,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.77,(24 oz can b058... purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)  l: polished-clear pale yellow-gold liquid; tons of white foam on pour tight cottony pad... head fizzles out rather quick; not really any lace the lil boogs slip away  s: good bit of lime aroma dominating its scent almost smells real; really smells more like sprite with a lil (corn-fed) beer mixed in... smells alright for what it smells like a shandy  t: not gonna lie a relatively delightful flavor at first: lime-infused lightly-doughy malt base; clean and dry on the outflow though the finish has the faintest color to it like a mix between a lime sweet-tart candy / lime air freshener... humming aftertaste of lime and cereal like trix; dry doughy  f: very soft suds pillowy texture and flow disappearing finish... maybe a delicate touch of residual lime syrup slickness? who knows?... light and easy-drinking even when drinking at cellar temp  o: tried it just to try it once... it wasnt too too dissimilar to a mexican beer with actual limes shoved in the bottle (minus real citrus acidity); kind of surprising and thankful it didnt taste more glaringly artificial... maybe this is what light beers need - flavor infusion - so what... (1423)
2788,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.65,24 ounce can into lager glass canned on 6/22/2018. pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a small fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that linger. light spotty lacing on the with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. aromas of lightly tart lime juice citrus peel/zest cracker corn white bread and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of limes pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. taste of lightly tart lime juice citrus peel/zest cracker corn white bread and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. mild herbal floral grassy zesty bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of lightly tart lime juice citrus peel/zest cracker corn white bread and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. nice robustness and balance of limes pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. moderately crisp/clean finishing. perfectly clean on lager flavors with no yeasty notes present. lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%. overall this is a nice fruited light lager. all around nice robustness and balance of limes pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink. very flavorful and not too watery for the abv. great balance between vibrant limes and pils malt/grains; with solid earthy hop presence for the style. not overdone on adjuncts. a nicely enjoyable offering and great style example. would be great for summer.
2789,Labatt Blue Light Lime,5,not bad. didn’t find the lime flavor overpowering. tasted more at the end of each sip than at the beginning. refreshing beer for a hot summer day. very watery mouthfeel so it goes right down. might have it again sometime. update : i did have it again.cheers.
2790,Labatt Blue Light Lime,1.98,well it looks like even canadian brewers are jumping on the fad that is light lagers with lime flavoring. i went into this review knowing full well that this wasnt going to be a high quality beer that id be reviewing but a part of me wanted to know how it would stack up against bud light lime and its ilk. why? who knows but thats just the way my mind works.  labatt light lime pours a yellow/gold color. a fizzy sudsy head (less than a pinky\s worth) forms and thins out in a little under 30 seconds. there was quite a collection of fizzy soda bubbles on the side of the glass. the aroma was of sweet citrus and lime with some light grain and vegetable smell. as mentioned the beer is indeed fizzy and overall feels pretty thin on the palette. the light citric/lime flavor is the most dominant note here but the beer is still pretty watery even with that lime presence. there are some grain and vegetable flavors detectable behind the lime but that\s about it. the aftertaste is clean and almost non existant except for some non-descript dryness and there is no alcoholic warmth at all in this beer.  indeed not a high quality beer at all. it is easy to drink but i would say this is more lime than beer. save for a summer day thirst quencher when you need something to whet your whistle and nothing more.
2791,Labatt Blue Light Lime,1.26,this is up there with the absolute worst beers ive ever had.  it pours like youd expect clear and gold with a quickly dissipating head.  this smells so unbelievably artificial like syrupy and saccharine lime with corn syrup and skunk.  this honestly tastes terrible. its revolting with an overly artificial and unpleasant lime flavor just out whatever the base light lager tastes like. i get some sweet corn and syrupyness this isnt even all that crisp which is what the style is supposed to be.  this is just sad. theres no reason at all to drink this.
2792,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.06,labatt blue light lime brewed labatt brewing company ltd. with an abv of 4.00% this brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a smell white head. the head to this brew goes away fast. this brew has the look of most light lagers on the market not saying that is a bad thing. the smell of labatt blue light lime is sweet with lime grains and malts. labatt blue light lime smell puts you in the mind set of lemon lime soda. now for the taste  it is lime with some beer taste. this brew has a nice smooth lime taste to it. not much else to say. the mouthfeel of labatt blue light lime is light  smooth clean and refreshing. this is a nice smooth brew to drink on a hot day. there is nothing overpowering about this brew. overall im giving labatt blue light lime a 3 out of 5. labatt brewing company ltd.did a nice job with this one. i would buy this brew again when it get really hot.
2793,Rübæus,4.17,now two twelve ounce brown bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. it was a foamy pour. theres just way too much just-off-white and pinkish tinted foam to make this a pretty pour. just as the norm this foam recedes unevenly and unattractively. only in this case its a slow process. the color of the liquid body beneath all the foam is something in the dark copper-amber or light mahogany category. it will leave irregular glass lacing. as ugly as it looks there is a nice raspberry/malt aroma that makes this appealing. its opaque without being murky. the taste is a very nice delivery of raspberry within a brew that includes some hops yeast and even a little malt. its sweet but not bothersomely so with a finish that bitters and drys things out. the mouthfeel is surprisingly wonderful considering all the initial foam. with the hop bite finish this may drink more like a raspberry aipa than a fruited sour. its body is also better than most fruited sours and more like a nice aipa. whatever if you like a good dose of raspberry in your brew this is a good option.
2794,Rübæus,4.24,the beer looks beautiful. a light clear red with a one inch white head emerges in a pint glass. the nose is all raspberry... semi-sweet with a bit more sour. the taste once again... all raspberry sweet and sour a bit more balanced on the taste vs. the nose. the mouthfeel is good balanced nicely between sticky and watery but a bit cloying and dry on the aftertaste which in this case is not a bad thing... it emulates actual raspberries. overall im impressed. if i were to design a beer to taste like a robust raspberry brew i would want it to turn out like this. damn good beer!
2795,Rübæus,4.37,it smell like a raspberry. that is a very good thing. the head is thin and white and the ale looks pink with bits of raspberry in it. it is a bit sweeter on the flavor as i favor sour in a fruity ale but it is not too sweet.
2796,Rübæus,4.21,i got a bottle of this beer of this beer from a christmas gift basket that my sis ans brah-in-law bought for me. it poured a clear pinkish amber with thin white ring head that is not leaving any lace. the scent had beautiful raspberry notes. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tart berry presence. the mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. overall it is a great beer.
2797,Rübæus,3.75,smells very raspberry and fruity. taste like sweet and tart raspberry with a nice balance between the sweet and tart. there’s a slight yeast taste in the finish. this is more like a cider than a beer but not bad.
2798,Rübæus,4.37,got a nitro draft from city tap in a pint glass with a finger of white nitro head on top. smells mildly of raspberries. very pink color. taste is excellent only mildly sour a little sweet and lots of raspberry flavor. light bodied with a very creamy nitro texture. excellent nitro tap.
2799,Rübæus,3.91,smurf jizz not beer.
2800,Ayinger Maibock,3.56,330ml bottle into a pint glass. appears to have been bottled 1/23 so 8 months old.  hazy amber body small head shrinks to a broken ring. specks of lacing. aroma is a mixture of malt and apple. taste is initially sweet then bitter then faintly sour. quite warming in the throat. disappointed in this one.
2801,Ayinger Maibock,4,from the bottle it pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a nice small white head that eventually diminishes to a thin layer. the nose gets a sweetish malt with some citrus. the mouth follows with a lovely sweet malt flavor that demands repeating.
2802,Ayinger Maibock,4.6,ive yet to meet a maibock i didnt like. ayingers version however is exquisite. chock full of semi-sweet bready malt goodness with slight touches of maybe apple or pear. super balanced wildly quaffable. another in the list of style-faves from this brewery. wow.
2803,Ayinger Maibock,3.98,a sort of cloudy peach appearance body is about medium with just below average carbonation aroma is malt forward with some citrus fruit and peel coming in second. theres a touch of roasted malt as well as some roasted chicory. taste is sweetsomewhat syrupy with a mild bitter sourness in the background. overall its very goodnot exactly what i expected and not sure i gave the most accurate description. may not be the best but its also interesting flavorful and wont disappoint if you give it a try
2804,Ayinger Maibock,4.18,undated (or at least i couldnt figure out the code!) poured aggressively from an 11.2-oz bottle into a stein.  appearance: orange-yellow beer large fluffy white head that lingered a few minutes and left only a little lacing.  nose: medium-roasted malt a bit of light citrus.  mouthfeel: medium plenty of carbonation.  attack: rich and full toast.  finish: perfect hop balance to the attack.  overall: this is a winner absolutely the best maibock ive every tasted; it deserves every bit of its #1 rating. i can’t imagine how good this would taste fresh on tap across the big pond at its home brewery.
2805,Ayinger Maibock,4.01,very malty and bready definitely on the sweeter side for a maibock but perhaps unsurprising given the abv. certainly drinks like a lower-abv offering: medium to light-full bodied but crisp and super smooth. a bit of clove and banana from the yeast along with notes of honey white bread and cracker.
2806,Ayinger Maibock,3.85,l-clean clear light gold color  s-grainy malt.....notes of honey...touch of breadiness..  t-grainy malt profile....good but lacks the big bready notes i was expecting...a touch of honey adds some sweatness to the grainy malt bill.  f-a bit thin in body...a bit sharp with the alcohol impression as well which may be from the thinner body per style..  o-i had a bottle of this a couple weeks ago and was a bit disappointed in what i was hoping for. now reviewing it i guess my opinion has improved a bit but still would take hoffbrau maibock 100 times out of 100 to this....not knocking this beer. its decent enough but im a bit of an ayinger fanboy and was hoping for elite.
2807,Ayinger Maibock,4.1,appearance: pours a golden-hued color with a very slight haze to it. healthy-looking foamy white head.  smell: spiced honey with a rich pils maltiness and bready biscuity tones. floral grassy herbaceousness hop accents.  taste: abundant bready pils malts with a sweet honey spread. soundly spicy with a floral grassy vibe amidst a balanced mingling of bitterness and alcohol. though still harboring a bit of malt richness theres a lightly drying quality to the finish.  mouthfeel: medium-bodied. medium carbonation.  overall: a quite likable beer from a stalwart brewery.
2808,Ayinger Maibock,4.79,enjoying a half liter in their biergarten in aying across from their hotel where i’m staying for the night. so nice to just walk over after a couple beers. finally got to try this legendary maibock! and it lives up to the hype. sweet slightly hoppy in the finish definitely strong like a bock should be. smoother than it should be this packs a punch. incredible beer.  bought a mixed six pack at their hotel and this was included. dated 30.03.24. as good as i remember. very subtle and quite boozy. super smooth and perfectly sweet. sneaks up on you bc it’s so drinkable.
2809,Ayinger Maibock,4,i really liked it.
2810,Ayinger Maibock,4.09,had this near pittsburgh pa from a 330ml bottled 2022-11-17 (date code l2321)  a - clear gold with a 2-finger white head and good lace  s - very bready noble spice floral/honeysuckle + clove light stone fruit  t - not quite as bready as expected from the aroma but still very present. semi-ripe peach cumquat pepper coriander clove grassy mild-medium bitterness that lingers.  m - medium body and carbonation. soft and creamy at first then drier.  o - this is very good. i was a bit surprised by the amount of bitterness. i enjoyed it and would have it again.
2811,Ayinger Maibock,4.03,11.2oz bottle thanks to ken for the beer! l: slightly hazed golden body thin & foamy white head s: biscuity grain lemongrass pepper t: biscuity pale grain sight nuttiness lemon zest white pepper honey bread earthy hops f: medium body pleasant carbonation balanced dry finish o: ken is a big maibock guy. they’re not my favorite but this was good!
2812,Cable Car Kriek,3.16,2021 vintage. ruby red body with surprisingly little carbonation and no head whatsoever. aromas are pretty standard kriek: cherry pie lemon hay bit of vinegar. very little funk which is a bit unusual. flavors are acetic but also semi-sweet with predominant notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar. feel is slippery and a bit flat due to the low carbonation. overall i think this is one of those beers that made waves upon release when the idea of belgian lambics was still relatively unknown in the us but now that we have broader access to some of the best belgium offerings here in the states it doesnt quite hold up. especially given the price point ($90/750ml) i would not buy this again but happy to have the opportunity.  64/100
2813,Cable Car Kriek,4.33,2021
2814,Cable Car Kriek,4.28,2021 vintage.  gorgeous ruby red pour; very few agitated bubbles of carbonation as it’s poured into the glass. it settles flat.  the nose is still distinctly cable car with noticeable yet restrained funk and lemony citrus. the cherry adds more brightness and is a fresh fruity addition. with time a lot of oak and brett comes to the forefront.  the palate is sour and noticeably acidic with a surprisingly low carbonation. was definitely hoping for more of it to cut that tart cherry and acid but overall it’s never overwhelming. the tannin from the cherry works really well with the overall profile.  as stated above not sure if that much carb was lost since 2021 or it was just never very high but i felt it needed more. that said it drinks bright and refreshing with restrained tannin.
2815,Molson Ice,3.75,molson ice is twice as nice like dangerfield compared to dice.  update 8/23: poems are lame people who write the same.
2816,Molson Ice,3.2,remember grabbin these babies out of a 12 pack for my pops back in the 90s. green bottle black and silver logo then more akin to a molson xxx of today. having with lunch pours a decent lasting white head smell doesnt give much of anything untypical of the style. taste is clean enough brewed in golden co for the states version im trying. decent enough.
2817,Molson Ice,3.11,bottle pour into a tulip glass. yellow golden appearance with a foamy white head. grass malt metal. medium to light body medium carbonation crisp finish.
2818,Molson Ice,2.85,an okay aal from north of the border.
2819,Molson Ice,3.81,good for a mass produced beer
2820,Molson Ice,3,this is the perfect beer of hockey season! you want a cold beer for fall after oktoberfest is over and you are short on cash but need to get blasted this is your canadian knight in shinning armor. 5.7% abv and a 6 pack made by coors now so it has that rocky mountain golden colorado water flavor good malt and freeze method to make it smooth. the drink-ability of this beer is superb for college kids but the snobs after they get married and become hobbyists will turn their noses up to this. i happen to like this beer and will give it a 3/5. this beer is not trying to be best in show this beer is trying to be that college buddy that wants your hockey team to win tell a funny joke and check in on you when you are in need.
2821,Molson Ice,3.77,quite a nice aal. bought a double deuce for beer butt chicken; poured about 6 oz into a can for cooking and the rest into a wheat ale glass. clear golden and with a fizzy head that didnt last long. big corny and grain aromas. nice smooth flavor more corn grain white bread a just a bit of a floral hop finish. much better than expected. although as a lifelong michigander it should not have taken until today for me to try it.
2822,Citra Bitter Monk,4.23,fairly clear medium gold colored body; fair carbonation; thin patchy head yet lasting; a few strings of foam hang down the glass. outstanding aroma; light citrus and brett funk combination; belgian yeast scent with a bit of raw oak; light grainy toastiness. wonderful taste; deft touch of citrus and dry white wine; mild note of brett funk; mild bitterness. medium-heavy body; soft and spongy on the palate; bold dryness undercuts a slight juiciness. the age of this beer is unknown to me but the contents sure are fantastic. elements of depth and complexity ooze and meld together with this beer combining bits of lime and white wine with a bit of graininess and a nice touch of bitterness all wrapped up with a slight wild yeast character.  pouring temperature: 47 °f; bottling data: batch #6; citra dry hopped version; aged in french oak chardonnay barrels
2823,Citra Bitter Monk,4.03,batch #6  cork was a struggle and there was barely a pop but pours with a bit of a head. hazy gold with a fine creamy ring on the surface.aromas of dusty funk grapefruit mango and cedar. big grapefruit dry chardonnay. musty/leathery brett...juicy sweetness balancing out the funky sour edge. light carbonation tart and dry. good.
2824,Citra Bitter Monk,4.4,medium: batch #5 cork + long tulip glass. opacity: slightly hazy and veiled. color: golden with strong activity. head: foamy 2-3 finger. legs: light but decent swirl reaction. smell: oak/white wine/hay/flowery/apricot. taste: wheat/peach/brett yeast/clove/herbal. feel: barnyard/barrel aged/light funky/dry hoped. body: medium slick and silky quite smooth. carbonation: moderate crisp a bit lacking for a belgian. overall: aged very well for 5 years just very slightly vinous and probably the hops went dull though it improves the balance. superb quality belgian ipa cross saison.  visual 7/10 - flavors 9/10 - sensations 9/10 - balance 8.5/10 - freshness 5/10 - intensity 8/10 - complexity 9/10 - appreciation 9/10
2825,Citra Bitter Monk,4.01,from the corked caged big bottle with no apparent date. sampled on march 1 2020.  the appearance i a slightly cloudy looking golden color with a short lived fizzy white head. no lacing.  the aroma emits brettanomyces right away with an oily toasted malt and white grape presence. no alcohol considering this was barrel aged.  the mouthfeel is generally light to medium and smooth.  the flavor has a tartness to it immediately with the sour-like brett character kicking in but it ends very refreshing and clean. no alcohol in the taste either. im not a huge fan of brett but this is nicely balanced all around.
2826,Citra Bitter Monk,4.5,bottle: poured a bright yellow color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. aroma of funky brett notes with some hoppy floral notes is super enjoyable. taste is a mix of brett notes with nice funky notes that pairs well with floral hoppy notes with a dry finish. body is full with good level of carbonation. this is indeed a world-class belgian style ipa saison. high level of drinkability with good level of complexity.
2827,Kiwi Rising - Double IPL,4.19,canned 12/2/20  weve arrived! the top rated ipl on this site unsurprising for one of the pioneers of the style and crafters of incredible lagers all around. ive been looking around for this one for a while but seldom saw it on the shelf except for a few times i saw it in passing before actively seeking out. lets jump into it  pours a semi-cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose presents a nice sweetness just as i suspected for an 8.5% ipl pushing into imperial territory. im picking up on aromas of floral hops bready malt caramel orange marmalade peach piney hops and a touch of lemon  a nice balance between the hops and malt keeps this beer constantly shifting flavor palates to keep things exciting. on the front end of the sip im tasting bready malt white pepper resinous oily hops and sweet citrus. the swallow shows more of a sweetness bringing notes of caramel malt papaya floral hops and crisp bready malt to finish  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in an astonishingly smooth beer feeling nothing like 8.5%. finishes dry and crisp but with a nice sweetness that lingers a bit  while i enjoyed this quite a bit it did really blow me away like i expected to. id love to try it a bit fresher as this can was almost 3 months old. if i find some fresher ill be sure to update this but it was good for what it is and damn drinkable
2828,Kiwi Rising - Double IPL,4.75,i recently had fresh mass rising and though it was just absolutely incredible. i grabbed this version and wow its every bit as good if not even a hair better. the nelson and new zealand hops add a great earthy winey almost funkiness to the beer. excellent. yb
2829,Kiwi Rising - Double IPL,4.18,canned 12.02.20. slightly cloudy gold on the pour with slight disappearing head and almost no lace. aroma is hoppy resin and melon. taste is interesting; starts aggressively hoppy with a peppery spice middle and finish stays bitter with lingering resins and tropical fruit hops. mouthfeel is crisp and creamy and 8.5% abv comes on as it warms. this beer is heaven for hop-heads which i am not. this is a well-crafted brew but i prefer something slightly smoother and fruitier.
2830,Kiwi Rising - Double IPL,3.44,pours clear gold in color with 1/4 inch head. taste is floral and wet hops melon with a good does of peppery spice. high carbonation slightly biter with moderate carbonation. a lot spicier than i thought it would be. very clean like most jacks beers. that said i do prefer some of their other ipas. i am fine with just the one.
2831,Kiwi Rising - Double IPL,4.62,16 ounce can dated 12/2/20 poured into a willi becher and consumed 12/23/20.  this ipl - or double ipl as the brewery calls it - is incredible. the nelson and motueka hops are presented without the distractions that often turn muddy in a neipa and the result is magnificent. pure hop flavor with no distractions - all the flavor of the best neipas in a package that brings out the best in the hops.  the look smell and feel of the beer are all good but not exceptional. the flavor though - wow. just remarkable concentration of hops. as punchy a hop flavor as any beer ive had including plenty that cost twice as much.  buy this beer if you see it. you will not regret it.
2832,Berserker Imperial Stout,4.45,midnight black body with a tan shallow head. roasted malts fill the nose but have molasses earth smoke and dark bitter chocolate supporting. frankly i am in love with how rugged the flavor complexion is of this throw back stout: roasted and earthy malt with accents of smoky coffee tobacco and earth meet dark chocolate and black strap molasses on the second half that just glob onto the palate. taste is just that tick more intense while still being drinkable. which brings me to the feel mirroring the taste strong roast but refined by the finish with the bright sweetness of the molasses robust yet smooth and quaffable.
2833,Berserker Imperial Stout,4.5,pours deep black color. aroma is intense dark chocolate caramel coffee and booziness. taste is a balance of the nose - bittervdark chocolate coffee and booze. mouthfeel is perfectly full.  overall an incredible stout.
2834,Berserker Imperial Stout,4.46,on draft at the brewery. poured out an opaque jet-black color with a small khaki-colored head of foam. it left sticky rings of lace on the glass. it smelled of dark chocolate dark dried fruit tobacco caramel and coffee. big roasted malt taste with toffee caramel and a sharp bitterness.
2835,Berserker Imperial Stout,5,hi fellow beer bros! im the great eric lambino and i just wanted to pop in and say woowzee wowsers this beer is a flavor explosion. from the caramel notes when it first touches your lips to the smooth cocoa middle to the crescendo of coffee to follow this beauty is a symphony of satisfaction. a melody of malt a diddy of delight! please for me the great eric lambino give this beer a chance.. your life will never be the same again. lambino out.
2836,Berserker Imperial Stout,4.75,2012 vintage enjoyed 2-2021. first sip tasted of dark umami plum and rich dark chocolate deep dark fruit roasted malt char and has a mild bitterness.
2837,Stroh's,3.01,okay! v light
2838,Stroh's,2.53,if you are not strohs then you are not drinking cheap beer! this is my go to when i’m going out to a party and am looking to crush a bunch. very watered down just something to drink on a social occasion
2839,Stroh's,3.5,i get what others are saying for the style this really isn\t bad. its real cheap at least but definitely not piss water as some would say. craft breweries have packaged and shipped way worse products that this one.
2840,Stroh's,3.64,i will always be confused when fellow reviewers give these adjuncts abnormally low reviews. you are comparing against the style not what you think makes you look like a cool beer reviewer. this particular brew is perfectly fine for the style.
2841,Stroh's,2.74,this beer was the big boy on the block when i was in high school and first time in the service. drank a lot of this at that time and liked it. now not so much but it would be better than nothing i guess.
2842,Stroh's,3.93,to me tastes similar to pabst in my book still a light and easy drinking beer.
2843,Stroh's,3.85,has a nice slight floral hop to it. similar to hamms not in taste but in character. its not your average mass produced aal that tastes like wet cardboard but has a flavor that makes you look forward to the next can.
2844,Stroh's,2.79,12oz can enjoy by date oct 24 2022 into a wooden shoe. wooden shoe? l: pours bright light yellow with big bubbles and a lightly soapy bright white head that falls fast. carbo retention is fair. light lacing. s: light malts grains gentle white bread light caramel. t: subtle bitterness light corn grains a light & pleasant grassy overtone. f: relatively soft & light bodied mouthfeel with a clean medium length moderately drying finish. o: as an iconic american adjunct lager this beer has a nice balance overall. it is lighter in nature slightly crisp and is alright in its style. drink it ice cold. very crushable.
2845,Stroh's,3.48,poured out of a 12 oz can into one of my pint glasses this beer pours a clear pale medium golden color with lots of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continually rising to the beers surface. has a fluffy looking white head thats initially well over an inch thick when first served. after a few minutes it settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some nice cluster swirls of film layer surface foam. good lacing here too. not a bad look at all. aromas of some bready malts some herbal and floral notes that i assume are the hop aroma. the taste is pretty much the same w/ some bready malts followed by floral maybe some slight hints of corn and or rice and herbal notes w/ slight hop bitterness. no bad tasting adjunct off-flavors or awful metallic off-flavors here. the flavor while not great or even that prevalent by any means seems to suit this beer just fine for what it is. certainly one of the better tasting beers of this style that ive had. it doesnt even start tasting terrible as it warms up a bit. has a crisp yet smooth light bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. easy to drink in the way a beer of this style should be. has a clean finish and decent aftertaste. not too shabby but not great to me either. this beer is exactly what it is trying to be. refreshing on a warm summer night here in cleveland oh.  eric
2846,Stroh's,3.33,not the strohs of old. i was disappointed in how it had changed. i have been looking for this brand for about a decade and finally found it an hour from home. once past my disappointment i rated the beer i was drinking. nothing much different from any of the others in its class. it is a good drinkable beer when you want just a plain beer. there are plenty of others in this category that i dont have to travel to get. i will still buy it when i see it for a change in the fridge. it does have a little uniqueness but not enough to go out of my way for.
2847,Old Monk 10000,5,old monk 10000 is a super beer. how do you know? it says so on the bottle! i dont know about you but i havent gotten this far in life by disregarding the advice printed on beer bottles. the world is full of hipster ipas but if youre having a spicy indian meal and need something to simultaneously manage the fire in your mouth and get you drunk old monk 10000 super beer is exactly the tool for the job. it may also be able to cure stds and cancer too but ill leave that research to professionals. i only gave this beer all 5s because giving it 10000 in each category wasnt an option.
2848,Old Monk 10000,2.54,poured from a 22oz bottled on february 8th 2022  head is immediately fizzy and not fine. retention isnt great but it settles ad a surprisingly thick cap and ring. body is a solid but light yellow straw with fine but plentiful carbonation. lacing does form nicely but isnt throughout the whole glass.  aroma is metallic with enough acetaldehyde to throw wine aromas. fruity and dry but for a lager that isnt great. not skunky but very yeasty.  taste is incredibly light for what it is similar to budweiser ricey but surprisingly clean considering the aroma. the acetaldehyde is still present and a bready malt is not present at all.  feel is dry and maintains drinkability even as it warms. long finish but incredibly dry and attenuated.  overall this comes off as a malt liquor for sure. the aroma and taste implied the abv but there is no alcohol burn. if it wasnt an expensive import it would be a touch better than hurricane malt liquor.
2849,Old Monk 10000,3.28,650 ml bottle mfg 10.12.2021 (you have to get your malt liquor ticks when opportunity knocks 15 months old at sampling) poured into a giant mug at fridge temp 8% abv. the beer pours mostly bright light amber with off white head. the head recedes to a thin cap but leaves no lacing. the aroma is moderate in strength featuring stale dusty grain and vegetable oil. the taste is semisweet slick malt with sucrose sweetness orchard fruit and a hint of floral hop. minimal bitterness. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a fairly undry finish. overall average malt liquor but not super enjoyable...
2850,Old Monk 10000,3.03,sampling a cold 650 ml bottle of this beer poured into a chalice because why not? consuming as part of the online malt liquor tasting. the beer pours a bright rich clear golden color with a fizzy bleached white head foaming up about 1 cm. this foam fades to a thin edge layer and one large island in the center of my glass. several lazy streams of carbonation rise to the surface. the aroma is fairly mild on this one with a little bit of grain and some general sweetness with a bit of apple cider note and some corn husk. but very faint all around may open up as it warms? first sip reveals a light to medium body with fine and spacious carbonation. texture is a little thin yet slick and does leave a slight coating feel on my lips. flavor is briefly grainy malt and then apple juice apple cider and refined sugar. the finish is a little bit of white wine or green grape and tarter cider note. no hops no booze. very easy to drink minus the sweetness and proximal to apple cider character. finish is lingering now with that white wine note. glad to have tried it for the tasting almost definitely wouldnt buy it again. i dont hate this beer but its pretty sweet so know that if you buy one!
2851,Old Monk 10000,3.45,straw yellow appearance with a thin white head. smell is of grain malt and a little of a dry apple cider character. taste is lacking any real character slightly sour but not in a good way. though for a malt liquor its drinkable. the finish isnt terrible.
2852,Old Monk 10000,3.7,old monk 10000 has a fairly thick bright white head and a bubbly hazy straw-gold appearance with minimal lacing. the aroma is of fermented bready cereal grains. the flavor is of a slight white wine or green apple note with very faint hop character. old monk 10000 has a high-medium body and a semi-dry finish.  rjt
2853,Old Monk 10000,2.76,l: clear honey hue with a finger of stark white foam. average retention but no lace.  s: between a lager’s straw aroma and an off-dry saison. strong apple blossoms.  t: certainly an abbey ale. full cracker and bready malts. starts easy to drink but gets a bit forward sweet and medicinal: an over the top middle taste that is hard to swallow.  f: medium body and a bit heavy handed. the carbonation is serious but welcome and while the finish is drier mid-palate is nearly cloying like a poor cider.  o: funny looking through the prior review before coming up with my overall thoughts: phenolic apples/cider medicinal. seems these are common sentiments. while there are well executed elements to the beer it is not repeatable for me.
2854,Old Monk 10000,3.32,(650 ml bottle; batch no. & mfg. date both blank; purchased cold single... split poured between a fat tulip and a teku)  l: crystal-clear honey-orange-amber colored liquid tiny bit of dusty sediment afloat; tight white bubbly foam holding more steady in the teku... lovely spongy collar keeps but little-to-no lace  s: classic cake donut (or sugar cookie) malt base subtle leather and vague coriander phenol spice similar to what ive smelled in some (strong) pale baltic lagers notably carlsberg special brew; so mildly medicinal but more so almost cider-like... light-moderate overall intensity  t: oh yeah but then no... dry vaguely corn-meal cereal overtone soft blast of ethanol through the middle sort of stale floury finish lingering a sec before quietly degrading in the aftertaste... after a few moments a vague (dry) apple pie flavor flickering... like a cider/champagne/malt liquor cocktail; flavors have a bit more pop/focus outta the teku  f: quiet heat lingering back and top of palate rounded mellow bite... bottom of palate feels relatively dry and clean... marginally ragged around the edges but doesnt have much viscosity or burn  o: reminds me of a lighter axe head - tastes a touch aged but also doesnt taste carefully brewed and/or made to be sipped cellar temp from a glass... do keep the bottle wrapped in the paper bag and this is a race to the finish - on your marks! (1581)
2855,Old Monk 10000,2.8,so its pretty much a beefier malt liquor im not a hater of malt liquor so i enjoyed it and sitting at 8 percent youll certainly feel it. basically imagine malt liquor with more dust and piss and youve got it! for real though it wasnt half bad.
2856,Red Poppy Ale,4.49,im not usually the biggest fan of sour beers but this one is exactly hits the jackpot where it is sour but not too sour. some brett funk mixed with the acidity of the cherries makes this an excellent beer for the fall season after a nice hike into the woods.
2857,Red Poppy Ale,4.27,tart cherry flavor with good carbonation. 2 finger lasting head.
2858,Red Poppy Ale,4.35,1900 name: red poppy brewery: the lost abbey location: san marcos style: barrel-aged wild ale abv: 6.5% date: i have searched for this beer for quite a while; i stumbled upon it about two years ago. climbing to 1900 reviews should be something special to drink. i have been wanting to drink this and cable car. using a tulip glass i served the beer at around 48 degrees. the pour created an off-white frothy one-fingered head with poor retention. the quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. looking at the murky color in the cup i would chart it around srm 26 dark rusty brown. the appearance is about average for this style. nosing the glass i smell barnyard cherries horse blankets fruity sweetness acidic acid wine oak and a fruity tartness. i taste tart jammy cherries barnyard funk straw oak acidic acid winey slight fruity sweetness herbal lightly floral and yeasty. the mouthfeel is puckering and tart finishing dry. the body is medium with a medium-plus carbonation. this is a fantastic beer! the cherries are bright vibrant and tart with a wild yeasty flair. this could be too much pucker power for some people but i find it delightful. i would love a few more bottles of this and let it age for several years to see if the pucker power is tamed. overall great beer; glad i got to consume it.
2859,Red Poppy Ale,4.02,2013 vintage.  the nose is fantastic; oak & jammy cherry; puckering. the palate hits with sour cherry medium tannin and dry oak. carbonation is completely gone which is a shame. without it that acid comes on a little too strong. opened to honor our daughter poppy!
2860,Red Poppy Ale,4.26,2022 vintage. can to wine glass.  l: pours a minimally reddish muddy brown with a foamy beige head that leaves plenty of lacing. lots of fine floaters.  s: ripe sour cherries and poppy seeds. yeasty funky and slightly vinegary.  t: the sweeter notes are less present than in the smell but they are definitely there in a fresher form. tart yeasty and very earthy. hints of fruity red wine.  f: quite soft and smooth despite its strong carbonation.  o: very good american take on a classic belgian style. fresh and fruity with the barrel coming through really nicely. great balance. subtle complexity. already looking forward to try some older vintages.
2861,Red Poppy Ale,4.18,red poppy pours a vibrant ruddy brown color with a massive tan head that dissipates quickly and unevenly producing a short-lived rocky effect that’s quite pretty while it lasts before leaving a film-like cap a thick crown and some spotty strands of lacing.  it has a nice aroma of vinegar and cherry with both leather and some slightly creamy notes behind.  that great vinegary flanders quality continues to the taste with the edges nicely rounded by the fruit and perhaps by age. there’s a definite red wine element to it also which provides some depth i enjoy. the taste closes with a fairly tart drying finish that lets just a little of the cherry juice linger.  the feel’s medium bodied and soft with soft carbonation.  this is a really well-made beer. the cherry doesn’t pop as much as say alexander but it’s a pleasant undercurrent throughout and counteracts the acidity. can’t really say what the poppy seeds added but they certainly don’t detract from the beer in any way.  i couldn’t find a clear bottling date anywhere on here but there’s a raised unobtrusive “19” on the glass making me think that’s when the bottle and/or beer was made.
2862,Red Poppy Ale,2.73,purchased in november 2021 from hopheads in altona on the outer western edge of melbourne in australia. drunk in july 2022.  pours a bright burgundy colour. theres no evident carbonation and no head.  the nose is strongly sour cherry and balsamic vinegar. there are hints of vanilla. the aroma already has my mouth watering but its already presenting as something thats going to be overwhelmingly sour and acidic. im not sure im looking forward to it...  the taste oh my the taste. it\s bracing. it\s like the first time i had a warhead lolly with an immediate reaction of wow that\s sour. in fact it\s extremely sour like a mouthful of sour (morello) cherries. there\s also a sharp dry kick at the end. as it warms it mellows slightly but develops tannic notes and grape or cherry skin highlights to the point it begins to resemble a red wine but with a residual vinegar aftertaste.  the mouthfeel is sharp and its almost stinging on the way down. not terribly enjoyable for mine.  overall this is too sour and then too much like im drinking a glass of red wine. ive read a number of reviews and none seem to mirror the harshness of my experience with the beer which was not an enjoyable one. maybe i had a bad bottle or it had been treated poorly before reaching me? not sure but i can only go on my evidence.  cheers!
2863,Red Poppy Ale,3.85,2022-05-08 skinny can served in a little glass.  pours dark purple-red. small head lots of carbonation. smell is moderate wood a little cherry skin.  taste is tart cherry tannic. some fruit skin bitterness.  mouthfeel is light. overall pretty good.
2864,Red Poppy Ale,4.43,pours a ruddy amber auburn. light aroma with a faint cherry tinge. lightly tart sharply effervescent completely delicious. tried this with at least a year and change on it possibly a lot longer. held up well.
2865,Red Poppy Ale,4.6,not able to try lost abbey often but this was gifted me in a recent can-cans bif so i got to try it. mixed reaction glad to be drinking it bummed i cant go to the store and buy any around here. but thats not a review- poured from 12 oz stovepipe can into a stemless teku glass. color brown like a strongly brewed iced tea but the tan head that quickly builds and faded to mere lacing assures me this isn\t tea. the aroma is definitely cherry forward but backed by malts of unknown origin. unexpected but very pleasant. taste leaves everything i experienced with this beer in the rear view. tart cherries strongly edge a malty base and combine in a way ive never experienced in a sour before. really something. and really good! feel is tingly but not from carbonation. crisp and smooth how thats simultaneously done i may never know. good beer. bummed its only 12 oz now.
2866,Burleigh Bighead,2.58,bottle comped to me on the street (dont ask).  c- / below average
2867,Burleigh Bighead,2.77,from bottle clear pale gold no head and flat looking. aroma mixes wet cardboard with grainy malt. light body and lightly fizzy. worth a try on a hot day.
2868,Burleigh Bighead,1.76,this beer is a no carb beer. it is very weak in colour reminding me of your standard american beer rather than an australian beer. however the taste is not totally watery. i would still rather drink this than budweiser!
2869,Burleigh Bighead,3.25,not much flavour watery but a thirst quencher on a hot day and session able
2870,Burleigh Bighead,2.11,straw yellow color no head retention very light smell of fruits crispy taste is slightly grainy and slighlty sour semi-dry finish watery feeling very low body
2871,Burleigh Bighead,1.48,bottle: has a child with an enormous head on it. enough said.  appearance: considering this is a no-carb beer not too bad. that said it looks a bit weak and flat with a bubbling head that dissipates too quickly.  aroma: very little in the way of aroma. what vague whiff is apparent is standard grains. quite dull.  taste: i dont really see the point of beers like this. breweries have to understand that if a beer has almost no flavour the only flavour that will come through is an awful skunky off-metal grain. mighty unimpressive.  aftertaste: disappears quickly thank god. still thats half the problem - there isnt that much flavour to begin with.  mouth feel: thin and watery with limited carbonation. just keeps getting better...  overall: a pointless and hatefully awful beer from a brewer that ought to know better. with their range of fantastic beers this is a truly awful deviation from the norm. add to that the fact that it is the price of standard full-strength it is actually quite insulting. if you want a beer buy one. if you really want a decent boutique light get a rogers beer. if you just want a reasonable light lager go for your standard macro white stag xxxx gold cascade light etc. i can assure you they are much much better value and taste a whole lot better. rant over.
2872,Burleigh Bighead,1.61,@tobeerornottobe said do you have a lighter beer? oh yes i sure do...  pours very clear and very light with minimal body and a filmy pure white head. lacing is relatively persistent and leaves a pleasant frothy pattern down the inside of the glass. no its not a brilliant looking beer but its very decent for the style.  nose is crisp and adjuncty with a note of corn or dms and a slightly sharper i-almost-want-to-call-it-hoppiness. but then it sinks back to sweet corn syrup and light vomitous astringency. no not for me.  taste is almost devoid of character even feeling—its as though this beer disappears as soon as you put it in your mouth. very thin and only leaving a hint of that corn because it has to. really reminiscent of a wet tortilla. appalling.  really horrible beer. of the kind that makes you scream out in disgust as to why it was ever brewed. no carb beer? it should be illegal.
2873,Imperial Stout,4.02,could use a taller head. lots of dark malts and toasted barleys. not super rich on the flavor or sweetness spectrums. overall very good but there are much better out there of my taste.
2874,Imperial Stout,3.55,l: pours dark brunette. forms a thick warm tan head fading slowly. a nice layer of foam forms on top of the snifter. held to the light this beer has a near-black charcoal hue.  s: malt chocolate.  t: roasted malt hint of chocolate jam and a bit bready. thin.  f: medium-bodied pretty light. some carbonation crisp. not similar to other imperial stouts.  o: imperial stout at 7%. just about sums it up. its not a bad beer per se but it follows the original english tradition which is to say lighter less body not as complex. there are better stout options available.
2875,Imperial Stout,2.34,i think this style of beer is just one i can’t get into. i can appreciate some of the flavors but the aftertaste is almost unbearable.
2876,Imperial Stout,3.37,a: pours up a deep reddish mahogany with a frothy three-finger beige head medium retention nice lacing.  s: immediate notes of chocolate followed my more muted hints of roasted malt specifically not coffee but roasted malt though some slight coffee notes do come out a little bit later as do some biscuity notes and some subtle hints of vanilla.  t: a warm bready sweetness greets you followed by a somewhat jammy malt flavor that hints at chocolate without quite getting there this is rounded out by some subtle hints of roasted malt and a crisp slightly tart finish.  m: on the lighter end of medium body slightly over carbonated and a bit dry.  o: this is a very good beer but to me it suffers from what i might call “og syndrome”. what i mean by this is that how this style is understood has changed since this beer was first brewed but this beer largely has not leading to a beer that misses the mark by no fault of its own. the beer has a surprisingly light body that one would not think of when one thinks of the style and the dryness and carbonation are unwelcome by modern standards as well. i do enjoy this but were i reaching for an imperial stout this would not be my first choice. it’s a bit too understated.
2877,Imperial Stout,4.07,everything you would hope for in a classic british stout. creamy light brown head that lasts until the end rich roasted barley mild hop aftertaste fermented in stone yorkshire squares what this adds to the flavor i cant say. would drink this again at the drop of a hat.
2878,Imperial Stout,4,i got what i paid for. $5 for a biggie bottle of stout. like going to the bunny ranch and sticking to the third tier of doves you’re going to get one with a few feathers missing. in life i suggest that you shouldn’t lie to yourself (you will be better off in the long run - or any “run” for that matter). and with tonight’s realization (for like the 50th time for me) maybe i’ll make the better decision next time.
2879,Imperial Stout,3.61,l-jet black with a half finger head thats tan and dissipates to a rocky lace. s-smells of faint roasted coffee toffee and chocolate. on an even slighter note i get some dark stone fruit. some soy sauce towards the end. t-follows the nose. a roasted malt flavor there but not much coffee. some chocolate vanilla and brown sugar. molasses. slightly sweet slightly bitter as well. some boozeyness at the end. f-medium bodied mouthfeel. decently high carbonation. o-ehh. i dont really get the hype with this beer. its solid but there isnt anything to write home about. for a surprisingly low abv imperial stout there was still a good bit of boozeyness on the pallet. just an okay beer. not sure if id try again.
2880,Imperial Stout,4.18,12oz bottle into a pint glass. coding no help in determining age.  looks nice enough. black body with a persistent tan head which leaves scattered lacing.  aromas of dark chocolate and faint coffee.  on tasting very smooth no roast slightly sweet with the coffee and chocolate notes detected by the nose.  mouth full finish smooth and almost creamy.  overall splendid stout would be happy to have ot again.
2881,Busch NA,2.83,12 oz can into a pint glass  appearance: you know what this looks like. it looks like cheap beer in every way that exists.  aroma: not that pleasant. i’d be annoyed if it was though. smells like canned corn somewhat to be very generous.  taste: rather inoffensive. actually somewhat refreshing. tastes very much like a u.s. adjunct or light lager. sort of reminds me of miller lite.  mouthfeel: watery chuggable. if a person wants to chug non-alcoholic beer anyway.  overall: it’s not good but it gets the job done if you want to drink cheap beer and not feel it. (which you probably wouldn’t with cheap alcoholic beer either unless you drank too much of it.) bud zero is an improvement on this model as far as no-alcohol u.s. lager goes. however this is also 99 cents a can and bud zero is like $1.50 so maybe head for the mountains if you’re looking to save some coinage.
2882,Busch NA,2.5,non-alcoholic beer has been getting better as a beverage for when you need or want to limit alcohol intake but prefer the beer flavor over soda waters tea or any of those other beverages. this one however still lags. appearance nose palate are all underwhelming compared to others like athletic brewing.
2883,Busch NA,1.5,i like it because it has virtually no taste or smell but helps me to replace good real local craft beer when the doctor says i need to give the liver a rest. good for carrying the tart cherry concentrate to help with that too.
2884,Busch NA,4.01,busch is a shitty beer. ive stopped drinking exclusively non-alcoholic beers. this is a great way to enjoy cheap beer with the guys in the garage when were working on cars without feeling left out. sometimes a cheap beer is exactly what youre looking for.
2885,Busch NA,2.46,not as bad as its more expensive unkle dad boi bud zero. but still lacking in the feelz department. it’s decently carbed but tastes like suckin on a thick can of pennies. kinda how reg pbr does. cheap tho!
2886,Busch NA,1.39,purchased as a single can from the local drive-thru for $.99. poured into a nonic pint glass.  l - pale straw with a quick-to-disappear one-finger linen head. s - corn wet hay. slight grassiness. t - corn flakes matzo bread. underlying sweetness. mild grass finish. f - medium carbonation. crisp and clean finish. very light body. o - a low alcohol content does not always a terrible beer make. unfortunately this is a pretty bad brew. i have yet to have a normal busch but the bar is set pretty low here. reminds me of a miller lite. will not purchase again and i highly recommend staying away from this one.
2887,Busch NA,3,for what it is not that bad. has nice carbonation. malty taste nothing on bitterness but refreshing and zesty. this is a great alternative when alcohol is not an option. cheap too just like the real thing.
2888,Busch NA,1.54,busch na is a very transparent very pale straw with a short lasting foamy head. it smells of corn and something of crackers. the taste is corny and the sweetness while not too strong is unbalanced. the aftertaste is an unpleasant corn taste. the feel is very watery with some bubbles. overall it is busch without alcohol.
2889,Busch NA,2.38,i have been drinking na beers for 2 months now due to reasons beyond my control. this one is not great but unlike 75% of the ones i have tried so far is not offensive. tastes like a watered down macro. does not have the wort flavor or the off flavors of many other nas. and the price is right. lets face it no one drinks na beer because they prefer it to the real versions. this one is not disgusting which puts it in the upper 25%.
2890,Busch NA,2.88,poured from a 12 oz. can. has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is dominated by corn. taste is also corn heavy some malts are present. feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall its not bad if you enjoy liquified corn but otherwise is a below average example of this style.
2891,Busch NA,3.89,i can no longer find this product locally. this na beer blew me away the first time i tried it. the reason was it was the lowest price na beer on the shelf and the taste was very acceptable. then i couldn’t find it for a while and once it came back the taste was noticeably more watery. do you think they could have changed the recipe ? it was still ok but now it has disappeared again.
2892,Busch NA,2.5,not actually all that bad. actually a fair tasting beer. i would not drink it on a consistent basis but i could see some times where high volume drinking is required this might warrant consideration.
2893,Busch NA,3.35,im rating this compared to the arsenal of crappy mass produced american beer. which i almost never drink. but in the defense of bush na this tastes every bit like a miller light. i really cant taste the difference. if you are a miller light fan and want to not get drunk i think youd rate this beer a 5. seriously. it tastes better than busch light.  maybe there should be an na section on beer advocate where we rate nas next to their alcohol equivalent. then this is hands down a 5.  if you like mediocre imported beer then go for a heineken 0.0. i cant tell the difference between that and its alcohol counterpart. thats also a 5 on the na scale
2894,Apricot Funky Wit,4.71,sour pairs well with apricot. smells deliciously floral and fruity. mild carbonation. taste the different stages of an apricot as if taking a bite out of a ripe apricot mild then sour and full fruit impact at end.
2895,Apricot Funky Wit,4.21,really tasty wild beer here woody and vinous and really quite a bit more sour than i expected it to be more sour than i remember from the original unfruited edition for sure its really acidic bacterial sharp and one glass felt like plenty. the apricot in it is amazing though natural ripe fuzzy and easy to appreciate in aroma and flavor. it also is really light on the grain side lighter than other wit types most of the time almost as much pils or something as there is wheat and less raw too this is really mild and clean there so the fruit really pops in this. a good amount of oak some lemon accent to the apricot and decidedly not peach or nectarine or anything its all apricot thats how pure it is in the taste here. with the name funky wit i could have handled a little more bretty wild character rather than this overt acidity its mature and all and its not without some of that but its the sourness that dominates for me. a little too aggressive if i am being critical but the flavors and texture of this are still fantastic. high carbonation is awesome on it and the dryness seems almost impossible given how much fruit runs all the way through it. delicious. looking to source the others in this series now!
2896,Apricot Funky Wit,4.3,had on tap. cloudy orange body with a white cap very eye catching. definitely an american take on the style for how sour it is and the oak presence but the wheat funk flowers and fruit lemon esters all make their signature appearance in the aromas amongst the neo sour fruits of apricot clementine and peach. taste is more uniform and not unreasonably sour take all of the sour fruit with a huge oak backing to start then hits with the traditional wit funk flowers and wheat to create a sour finish with a comparative hardy balance. feel is oak laden with sour funk wheat and fruit esters textures incorporated. a new world wit
2897,Apricot Funky Wit,4.15,rating for style i am going with this being more of a belgian sour or american wild ale than a witbier.  quite a bit of yeast sediment in this 22 month old bottle. with a careful pour and minimal sediment the brew is lemon yellow and appears translucent although there is no avoiding a fair bit of sediment. head production and retention are weak but not poor for the style.  on the nose displays notes of coriander orange apricot bubblegum hay and very light tannins.  despite the restrained nose this is a very sour brew on the palate with loads of tannins vinegar tart overripe apricots oak orange peel coriander and very musty earthy hay. a great balance between funk sourness and tartness that few brews manage although it could benefit from more representation of the apricot.  fairly strong puckering from the lacto-like sourness; slick feel.
2898,In Perpetuity,4.5,from a three-week-old can stamped love is love pours a bright hazy orange. smell and taste combine citrus white grape and earthy herbs. a lot of flavor at a lower abv as ipas go.
2899,In Perpetuity,3.9,canned on 6/30/23; consumed on 7/11/23  pours an opaque dark orange body topped with multiple fingers of thick fluffy eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a half-finger of cap large collar and a dense walling of chunky lacing surrounding the glass.  aroma opens to a waxy nelson-dank accented with white grape pith as a flaky cereal grain undertone expands; hints of white peppercorn ease through notes of musty lemon and grass on the back end of the bouquet.  taste brings mandarin peel grapefruit and an underlying hint of key lime as musty white grape meets lemon bubblegum over the mid-palate and a flaky grain lingers on through the profile.  mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation dispersing tautness into silky textures as a slight creaminess prevails leaving a glossy fade through resinous undertones on the finish.  a steady well-attenuated dankness rife with tropical overlay; a standard neipa in the ever-quaffable tree house rotation.
2900,In Perpetuity,4.53,poured from 16-ounce can into a thin-walled crystal goblet. hazy pale yellow with a two-finger white head that left scads of pretty lacing. big burst of grapefruit upon opening the can and it only got better. loads of grapefruit orange and tropical fruit on the nose and palate (think breakfast juice). very low bitterness with hints of citrus zest lingering on the finish. satisfying mouthfeel very juicy. well balanced and very drinkable i.e. goes down easily and you just want to keep drinking it. first time with tree house and im suitably impressed. highly recommended.
2901,In Perpetuity,4.64,pouts a very hazy yellow-orange color with a thick white head that laces the glass a lot as it fades slowly. smells of sweet malts melon citrus. tastes of big citrus - orange grapefruit lemon mixed with melon and a hint of toasted malt there at the end. its lighter than it feels crisper than it looks perfect amount of carbonation a sleeper in the treehouse line of new england ipas. worth it if its there.
2902,In Perpetuity,4.49,2 months old. can to wine glass.  l: pours a hazy yellow with a pillowy white head that leaves thick rings of lacing. no floaters.  s: tropical notes of mango and guava paired with ripe tangerine and strawberries packed in an almost vanilla-like bubblegum sweetness.  t: tropical and citrusy but also grassy and even a bit earthy. mango tangerine strawberries and white grapes. ths trademark bubblegum sweetness is very present in the taste as well. bitter finish slightly zesty.  f: full and juicy. smooth and a bit creamy. proper carbonation.  o: fantastic beer. bursting with flavor even though its (relatively) low abv is clearly perceptible. nicely balanced and very complex. might be the best (single) ipa ive had so far.
2903,In Perpetuity,4.57,look: a mango yellow with a strong white head that dissipates to a glossy surface with a foamy perimeter.  lacing: a fairly broken soapy lacing. you can tell where each sip ended but no full rings were established.  body: literally looks like a glass of orange juice with a subtle head.  smell: like a great neipa. subtle and balanced like a hoppy pine tree accompanied by a well proportioned waft of citrus. a mango/orange backed by hopps smell to be exact.  taste: incredibly smooth no burn not pungent but a well balanced bittersweet juice taste with a strong fruity citrus that ends quickly with a smooth slight lactose bitter finish.  tail end: it leaves you knowing you just sipped a top notch beer. quite possibly one of the best new england india pale ales i have ever drank. its orange juice water in terms of smoothness.  after taste: almost non existent other then a slight citrus reminder that ends in a very calm cream ending.  as someone who has drank multiple beers from treehouse micro projects to the ninth best beer on this website i can see how this beer is rated as a 100 after almost 1000 ratings. this beer is a true diamond in the rough.  in perpetuity is a white whale of a beer for any beer advocate on this website this value grows exponentially as your distance from new england increases.
2904,In Perpetuity,4.49,fantastic example of a ne style ipa. look is standard hazy. nice citrus aroma but the taste pops big time. amazing combo of two of my favorite hops - citra and nelson. these two combine for a citrus white wine/grape juice taste but not too sweet. the lower abv is a plus.
2905,In Perpetuity,4.39,canned 9/14/22. “be kind love is love” stamped on the bottom of the can. seems like a fitting message as this is review #1312 for me. iykyk  alright finally time to cross another top 250 tree house beer! this one is currently sitting at #133. i believe this is only brewed once a year so i’m happy to have made it there when they had it available. let’s crack if open and see what it’s all about  pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  there’s a nice bite to the nose in this one leaning a bit more traditional than they usually do. i’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe bready malt peppery hops orange zest resin mango juice and light gooseberry  it doesn’t quite have the same bite in taste but i do like it quite a bit. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting overripe mango white wine gooseberry bready malt grassy hops light caramel pineapple juice and cantaloupe. the swallow brings notes of orange zest peppery hops caramel malt tangerine gooseberry light white wine and overripe cantaloupe  a medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp and dry beer. finishes dry and chalky really different for them but i dig it  i really like this one. maybe not quite as good as it’s hyped up to be but very nicely done
2906,Funeral Bock,4.2,canned 10/21 -- just in time for halloween. very dark brown nice nose of coffee and chocolate. taste is highly layered with an upfront bitterness followed closely with an unmistakable dose of roasted grain more expresso coffee and maybe a bit of licorice. exceptionally smooth and clean this lager has close to mystic qualities. the 7% abv is enough to give a warmness with no alcohol bite.  highly recommended this is great stuff.
2907,Funeral Bock,4.18,poured from a can at fridge temp. pours black/very dark brown with a good amount of tan head. the nose is full of chocolate burnt toast dark malts and some oaky bitterness. an earthy note is there as well.  the taste is excellent. here im getting some burnt toffee dark chocolate oak some charred wood slight coffee grounds and some big bready malts. maybe a touch of dark fruit but thats definitely not a big player. the aftertaste is mostly a woody bitterness.  the mouthfeel is dry and medium bodied. overall this is an excellent beer!
2908,Funeral Bock,3.68,dark brown pour head settles go a thin cap of light brown.  aroma is burnt toast dark fruits molasses and a grain note as it warms.  tastes is chocolate toast dark fruit and a roast note and a little smokey vibe in the aftertaste.  medium body but very full feel to it fairly carbonated clean dry finish. just the ever slightest hint of abv in the throat/nasal cavity.
2909,Funeral Bock,4.06,excellent. dark brown body. smells of chocolate and toasted biscuit. slight burnt malt. floral and citrus bitterness on the backend like a chocolate marmalade. medium body good carbonation. yummy.
2910,Funeral Bock,4.17,handsome dark russet amber brew with fine-grained foam in the blanche de chambly goblet. quite sweet with a winter ale sort of taste but seems to be all dark malts and no spice. fruit cake with some burnt sugar and a dark coffee aftertaste. toffee notes with a nutty finish.  here is actually an unusual beer i would gladly drink more of. the combination of the dark flavors with the sweet bock taste is quite appealing. more for sipping than quaffing. from the 16 oz can purchased at new seasons. dated 10/25/21. intriguing black cat label.
2911,Funeral Bock,3.93,16oz can from tavour. near black pour ring of head. light roast malt aroma. taste is mildly sweet nutty with a light roasty bitterness. super smooth.
2912,Funeral Bock,4.13,16oz can with a canned on date of 10/05/20 bordering on dopplebock territory with this abv. very dark brown color with a finger of head. aroma of cocoa roasted malt bread and earth. much the same in the flavor. surprising amount of roast and that gives some bitterness so this beer does not get too sweet. good body and appropriately carbonated.
2913,Molson Dry,5,excellent!!!!
2914,Molson Dry,2,not much taste. not much of anything! if i was handed this blindfolded i wouldn’t think it was beer. does not taste bad but does not taste like beer.
2915,Molson Dry,3.24,i bought a can at the lcbo in ontario 473ml at 5.5%. poured a 2finger head into glass . taste was refreshing and smooth with a crisp finish. overall an average lager beer. cheers
2916,Molson Dry,2.64,tastes like piss
2917,Molson Dry,3.07,750ml can purchased from ontario grocer. poured into a large glass mug (the entire 750ml fit in the mug). lively and foamy head that lingered for a few minutes and dissipated to a 1/8 film throughout the drink. a surprising amount of lacing. carbonation was heavy off the start but tapered off and was rather subdued by mid-drink. smells of corn with a very slight skunk - that familiar molson aroma that is ever present in every college dive bar i\ve frequented in ontario. the taste was surprising: very little of the adjunct skunk that i know and expect from molson product. instead i was pleasantly surprised with a nuanced flavor with light grain notes temperate hop bitterness on the back of the tongue and a dry finish - no off-putting aftertaste either. i purchased this can with the intention of slamming it in a review; i was expecting a boozy version of canadian. that didn\t happen. i honestly enjoyed it. it\s simple refreshing and was attractive from pour to finish. i wouldn\t turn this down in the future. at 5.5% and 750ml this could certainly do some damage if several were downed on a hot summer day.
2918,Molson Dry,3.21,it pours a nice light yellow color with a nice head. i started drinking this when we would travel to expos games in montreal. we would bring back a 12 pack each time we came home. it was a good tasting beer not the best molson but good tasting. the beer has a hoppy and dry finish which shouldnt be a surprise since its in the name.
2919,Molson Dry,2.27,pours a clear yellow with decent head. that is the highlight of this one. the scent is faintly grassy with a hint of lemon. the combination does not hit my nose well. taste follows the smell with some obvious bitterness evident. thin mouthfeel and a slightly unpleasant bitter aftertaste
2920,Molson Dry,2.76,473 ml can served cold into a pint glass. lcbo purchase for $2.50 cdn or so. continuing my recent mini-run on molson products.  appearance - fairly bright golden color nearly two fingers of white head poured as well that fizzle out in a minute or two. no lacing great clarity.  smell - no smell other than some creamed corn and the slightest hint of apple skin.  taste - virtally nothing watery maybe some faint trace sweetness.  mouthfeel - it is indeed dry carbonation is a bit too much but is okay with the lack of flavor.  overall - for a beer that tastes like nothing yet has 5.5% abv and is dry as indicated on the label molson hit the target the set here unfortunately its not a brew worth repeating. still couldve been so much worse.
2921,Molson Dry,3.21,473ml can that was purchased across the boarder in dunham.  crystal clear pale yellow golden hued brew slight sweet smell of corn and a mild cracker graininess. clean for the most part bone dry with a kiss of alcohol. very clean grain flavor modest hop bitterness ... not a whole lot of flavor but a bit drinkable or perhaps just refreshing.
2922,Molson Dry,2.46,l- straw yellow fairly clear low-medium lace foam dies down quick.  s- smells like any cheap lager. still better than most american beers.  t- tastes clean bready corn. i really dont get much hopps but they must be in there. best served ice cold from a cooler of ice to down quickly for a warm buzz.  f- goes down clean tasting like great western light lager in the yellow tint can without that watered down taste of american lagers though.  overall a 710ml can for $4.50 cad hits the spot if you want to have just over one with the boys. its best drank ice cold like most cheep brews.
2923,Molson Dry,1,a terrible dry beer. ive never had a good dry beer.
2924,Triple Shot,4.65,look - black thick but not syrup great tan head rimming lacing…. as good as it gets! smell - roasted malts and coffee taste - coffee dark chocolate roasted malts feel - full body fizz lighter carb great mouth coat overall - best coffee stout i can remember
2925,Triple Shot,4.43,canned 2/2022. im pleasantly surprised by how sweet this isnt just a hint of rich semi-sweet chocolate at finish. the nutty roasty base makes for a wonderful coffee showcase throughout.
2926,Triple Shot,4.53,appearance - the beer poured a deep black color with an inch of tan head.  smell - the beer smelled like fresh roasted coffee with roasted bean notes and chocolate in the profile.  taste - overall this was like espresso with a huge body. there were notes of fresh roasted coffee fudge chocolate ice cream and just a hint of vanilla. the sweetness came out more in the finish. in the big picture it was an assault of espresso.  mouthfeel - the beer had a nice thick clingy body. it allowed the bitterness to linger.  overall - this was a really nice stout with a lot of coffee. finding a more intense coffee stout would be a challenge.
2927,Triple Shot,4.38,nice dark black color with outstanding brown foam and lacing. smell is nothing to write home about—water slight roasted malts and a faint sweet coffee.but it tastes fantastic: deep coffee tones permeate throughout and a sweet molasses cover a base of toasty malt stout. cheers.
2928,Lager,3.83,pours dark amber gold medium carbonation and a decent foamy head. dark and earthy aromas with sweet notes. initial malt and toffee taste washed down with slight hoppy aftertaste. smooth and crisp feel. nice example of how you can change up a lager.
2929,Lager,4.54,a really good easy drinking amber. flavorful but crisp. it\s what a boston lager tastes like when it\s a good batch but that seems rare these days. if i closed my eyes and drank this i wouldn\t know it was a lager. caramel malts toffee and a middle bitterness to it. balanced between sweet and dry. i really like this.
2930,Lager,4.43,l: dark amber in colour some lacing s: candied fruits malts herbs bread t: citrus zest herbs cake f: full-bodied balanced carbonation  o: 4.5
2931,Lager,3.77,very malty (as the label states) and almost smoky in taste. poured from a 6 month old can into a pint glass it had a decent head and aroma. i would call this more of a vienna lager than an american lager. it feels well crafted and it was enjoyable but not outstanding to drink.
2932,Lager,4.55,ahh! the best american lager that l ever had. this is my go to lager. the aroma malty hoppy toasty bread toffee. the taste same as above very smooth easy drinking. 5.2 abv makes it a good session beer! very nice to look at with a white one finger head and nice lacing. you can see the quality! the carbonation hangs around . the finish gives you that light punch of hops at the end. this beer is a hidden gem!
2933,Lager,3.75,3.75  low carbonation. bitter for a lager. drinkable
2934,Lager,4.04,very respectable lager. many have compared this to sam adams and i think thats accurate. good frothy head although not rising too much. hop character is perfect for my taste producing a clean bitterness without overwhelming the malt. smooth finish very easy drinking.
2935,Lager,3.5,12oz bottle. light amber body small foamy head. malty aroma toasty. taste is lightly toasted malts with a nice hoppy kick at the finish. simple bt todays standards but a trend setter in its time.
2936,Lager,3.54,color: reddish-brown like a slightly pale copper smell: hops are the main scent that jumps out taste: very hoppy with a slightly sweet finish. very lightly floral feel: medium carbonation medium weight to it. it feels crisp and fresh
2937,Amigos,2.86,11.15 fl oz bottle bbe feb 2013. im not scared. found a single bottle of this on the floor at the local bottle shop. got it for 99 cents. cerveza especial. product of the uk - not what youd expect to read on what appears to be a mexican style lager. label lists a 6.00% abv.  poured into a kentucky bourbon barrel ale mini snifter.  a - pours a standard dark golden body; the same as it appears through the clear glass bottle. conjures hardly anything for a head merely a quarter inch of white froth that falls to a thin ring quickly. appears aptly carbonated but has no real head. some thin sticky scattered random lacing when given a nice swirl.  s - aroma is where this one loses me. its not typical of a lager or a malt liquor or a light beer for that matter. has a bit of faint dusty bready malt sweetness with some vague notions of citrus fruit / citrus peel probably lime or lemon.  t - taste is extremely sweet & syrupy with a hint of lemon-lime tartness that is actually quite nice. definitely over the top sweetness dominates this one with the citrus flavors coming in second. its not awful but its certainly not complex stuff.  m - feel is smooth & sweet. easy-drinking; definitely doesnt feel like 6.00% abv. needs better carbonation.  overall this was probably an old as hell bottle so i will do my best to try this one again fresh. until then well just call it interesting.  amigos -----3/5.
2938,Amigos,1.93,330ml bottle from local express kings cross london: this one was a really terrible beer by no means the worst ive tried but to be honest i wasnt expecting much else from it & it probably wasnt even quite as bad as i feared going in. obviously itll not be one ill pick up again given it was far too sweet thin & off-putting but i guess it could have been a lot worse.
2939,Amigos,3.34,i expected this to be another sub-corona clone but was pleasantly surprised by the citrus taste and the overall drinkability.
2940,Amigos,1.55,refreshing but dull too overwhelming citrus flavour ruins this beer.
2941,Amigos,2.49,poured from a clear bottle into a dogfish head pint glass. pours a medium golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to light patchiness no lacing. aroma is immediately noticeable on opening the bottle and pouring a strong fruity and agave (tequila) citrus smell malt is subdued. flavor is watery tequila lime sprite citrus sweet. light bodied. apparently an import to compete with the light fruit beers and drinks this does not taste much like beer. a faint hint of malt but really tastes almost exactly like a left over tequila and sprite drink from last night with melted ice cubes. not familiar with this style but its not for me.
2942,Amigos,2.52,a 500ml clear glass bottle with a bb of sept 2014. acquired a while back from a supermarket. described as a tequila flavoured beer allegedly created in honour of the aztec god huehuecoyotl. inspiring...  poured into a straight pint glass. a clear golden colour with good carbonation. forms a smallish head of white foam that lasts for a moment before dissipating. aroma of sweet artificial fruits and sugar with vague hints of lime weak malt and a whisper of stewed leaves. decidedly subpar.  tastes like an artificial fruit cocktail with a sweet finish. notes of lime juicyfruits sugar/sweetener faint malt weak stewed leaves and a harsh quality in the background. little bitterness to speak of but a touch of acrid cardboard upon swallowing. mouthfeel is smooth and tingly with prickly carbonation and a thin watery body. mildly astringent followed by an aftertaste of lime cocktail sweetener and harsh stewed leaves.  blech - not much of a beer. looks pretty normal however the aroma and flavour possess a cloying sweetness and fake fruit notes that jar the senses. insipid body. a fairly unpleasant experience at least for anyone with functioning tastebuds. one to avoid.
2943,Amigos,1.69,found this bottle in manhattan ks. i thought it was a typical mexican lager but closer inspection revealed it to be from the uk. further inspection of the ingredients led me to the discovery that they put sugar flavor and citric acid in it. all of those ingredients make it taste like a corona that has already had a lime added to it. or possible like a miller chill. its fizzy and works okay with tacos but it was just not my thing.
2944,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,3.33,too sweet for me
2945,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,3.44,almost like someone dumped coffee/chocolate in my beer. bit of a boozy note whether you like that or not.
2946,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.05,poured from a 12 ounce bottle dated 4-19-23 into a snifter.  look- black visible particulate creamy light brown head above average head retention and lacing.  smell- chocolate coffee vanilla slight bourbon slight oak medium strength of scent.  taste- chocolate vanilla coffee sight bourbon between low and medium strength of flavor.  feel- between thin and medium body average carbonation between low and medium bitterness mildly mouth warming mildly creamy.  overall- black with visible particulate and above average head retention and lacing. bouquet was chocolate coffee vanilla and slight bourbon. flavor was chocolate vanilla coffee and slight bourbon. body was between thin and medium body with mild mouth warming properties and mild creaminess. overall this beer provided an average drinking experience. it had pleasant bouquet and flavors but the three months in the bourbon barrels was not enough.
2947,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.25,unbelievable chocolate up front very creamy! just love it!!
2948,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.41,strong chocolate flavor smooth texture great!
2949,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.85,a stout that checks all of the boxes for me. its easy to find and a reasonable price for what you get. chocolate coffee raisin toffee and oak are among the delicious flavors that really make this stout pop.
2950,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,2.97,really wanted to like it.  pours black as night into my guinness glass. a little amber-copper visible right around the edges. 3-inch head that dissolved in minutes to a thin layer.  smells fruity sweet and alcohol.  taste: i don’t usually drink beers > 7%. so take this for what it is. i’m not tasting much beyond the alcohol. some coffee roast lingers in the aftertaste. not getting much sweetness until the aftertaste. it’s getting more complex as it warms up but still it’s just stronger alcohol than i enjoy.  feels decent. not too watery. not too heavy. lightly carbonated. overall good feel.  like i say i really wanted to like it. especially for the price (i think it was like $4 for the bottle.)  not for me.
2951,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,3.73,near black liquid with a decent head. streaks and spots of lace. good amount of bourbon in the nose. chocolate and coffee. taste is chocolaty with a light coffee bitterness. alcohol is hidden. oak and bourbon tingly carbonation the moves towards creamy as it warms. very drinkable. a solid bourbon ris.
2952,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.7,the quintessential barrel aged stout. the beer is powerful yet subtle confident yet vulnerable. works as an entry level barrel aged stout for beginners - but seasoned beer drinkers will recognize the balanced genius of this beer. might be one of the five beers i take to a desert island. eternal respect to dm. enjoy the silence.
2953,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.25,silly smooth. the chocolate vanilla and coffee are extremely well balanced. beautiful warming bourbon finish. no huge sign of the 11% as its just so smooth. glad ive finally got to try this it had been on the list for a while.
2954,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4,12oz bottle \decanted\ into my kbs thistle
2955,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.31,l- looks about as dark as you can get for n imperial stout. more head than most. s - smell is neutral to sweet heavy. t - tastes like what you want an imperial stout to taste like neutral but subtly sweet and heavy. f - feels uncarbed heavy and mildly syrupy.  overall i am impressed i thought due to the fact that its highly accessible that it would be sub-par however it is not. and if you didnt know it was 11% youd have no idea maybe thinking tops 9.
2956,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,3.64,12 oz bottle into a snifter. pours dark with a small tan head little retention. smells of distant roast malt a bit of coffee. pretty vague. tastes the same as the nose. nothing pops out it’s balanced but weak on the palate. the 11% abv is well hidden. feel is thin to medium medium carbonation. overall this supermarket beer is ok at best thin and commercial at worst.
2957,Dragon’s Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.23,i thought it was a very good imperial stout not sure about mythology. it did provide hints of coffee bourbon chocolate smooth finish nice scent with a high octane content if you know what i mean.
2958,Pulp,4.5,poured into a weizen glass. pours a hazy medium golden amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. aroma of wheat malt citrus hops orange and light stone fruit. flavor is wheat malt citrus hops grapefruit orange and hints of stone fruit. citrus rind finish with nice bitterness. medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation. this is hands down the most interesting wheat ale ive ever had. the brewery is pushing the style envelope with some serious citra hopping but it tastes great like a wheat based well hopped pale ale. one of those beers that makes me wonder why no one has done this before. the citrus from the hops is fruity and great and the bitterness is just right. this is a fine ale that i wish was available here in the northwest.
2959,Pulp,4.25,nice orange pour yielding a fizzy head. you can hear the carbonation. the beer is a bit opaque but not juice hazy. the label does not lie - smells and tastes like slightly carbonated orange juice. the wheat provides a lightness to the mouthfuleel and makes this one extremely drinkable. this is a great one for the style. enjoyed the simple and elegant can label.
2960,Pulp,4.24,hazy yellow pour with orange accents white head and blobs of lacing. smells of super fresh citrus hops lighter peach and wheat. more grassy in taste otherwise the same. feel is wheaty and hoppy juicy in a thinner way. this is an ipa in a wheat disguise but it is delicious sign me up for a couple cans of these in the early summer
2961,Pulp,3.81,pours a very pale hazy yellow that has some transparency. spice and flower blossoms in the aroma. some spice and herbal hoppiness in the taste.  lacking depth in the taste and mouthfeel. not thin or without taste but one dimensional.  overrated. gumball head puts this beer to shame.
2962,Pulp,4.38,can. drank from the can so no comment on appearance.  this drinks like an ipa. hops seem to be a lot of citra. how is this a wheat ale? so juicy and fruity. drinks incredibly easy. orange orange peel and orange citrus for days. soft. has some hops showing but not bitter. this was great.
2963,Pulp,3.85,l: 16 oz. can poured into a weizen glass. a hazy yellow with a 3 finger white head. great retention and lacing. s: orange and citrus are present t: grapefruit pith f: heavier than expected o: good but not really my thing. i’m unsure how i feel about the style and strongly prefer german hefeweizens so i’m probably rating this too low.
2964,Pulp,4.6,16oz can poured into pint  a- pours a hazy yellow orange color with a one finger foamy white head that reduces to a ring  s- smells of orange juice pith grapefruit zest mangoes melon and a hint of toasted wheat  t- zesty grapefruit and pithy tangerine up front followed by a slight sweetness that gives notes of mango & pineapple. the finish gives more zesty citrus with juicy finish that lasts into the linger  m- medium body with medium carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and a crisp finish  o- juicy pithy zesty and extremely quaffable outstanding
2965,Pulp,3.81,16 oz can into a curved pint glass.  pours a hazy golden yellow color with 3 fingers of soapy white head. the head leaves some clingy cobweb lacing. good retention.  aroma brings strong notes of orange with a bit of mango and wheat.  taste follows the nose: fresh oranges mango peach with a little grapefruit and wheat on the finish.  feel is medium bodied with lower carbonation. very soft and creamy.  overall a very good wheat beer. its basically a straight up pale ale but the wheat does add a bit of body and flavor on the finish.
2966,Galaxy Scaled,4.31,poured from a 16 oz can dated 8/18/23 into a shaker pint glass. l - pours a hazy yellow color with a frothy white head that dissipates slowly. s - smells of pineapple. t - tastes of pineapple and citrus. f - medium body and carbonation. o - very tasty ipa.
2967,Oberon,3.7,nice refreshing summertime beer. not going to knock your socks off but it’s a good crushable session beer. good for the lake cookouts pool and tailgating.
2968,Oberon,3.87,july 2023. hartwell. nice can. karen said it had a good head but she is not a beer drinker so we have to weigh that with a grain of salt. a little bitter tasting overall it’s nothing that’s knocking my socks off but i would certainly drink it over other things. this is a pretty good review don’t you think
2969,Oberon,3.99,lemon zest and some yeasty alcohol esters. mouth feel is really where its at with a nice bite but still syrupy and not too heavy. slight wheat and lemony taste with a slight floral hop.
2970,Oberon,3.76,beautiful pour…deep yellow gold with a healthy white foam head. muted notes of bread grassy wheat and light sweet floral notes. tastes of malts wheat  slight phenolic sand a hint of sweetness. great mouthfeel…silky smooth on the tongue with carbonation and little on the lower side of medium. overall i am not a big wheat beer fan but i can drink this one and enjoy it.
2971,Oberon,4.51,nothing better on a summer day
2972,Oberon,3.64,really good pale wheat here not my favorite style but this one is well-executed and enjoyable; pours a cloudy pale orange on-tap with a good layer of creamy lace; more hoppy and citrusy than i expected nice malty wheat character in the creamy body with some spice characteristics and floral grassiness. crisp finish overall. nice!
2973,Oberon,3.93,12 ounce cold can poured into a pint glass. light gold with haze foam drizzles down quick. aroma is wheaty malt with s pinch of lemon zest. taste is of whole wheat bread with a tasty little lemony hop note well balanced. mouth is medium full effervescent smooth lightly crisp and perfectly dry. overall 4 ingredients made into a great american wheat ale. nice!
2974,Oberon,4,pours out of the can a slightly opaque straw-gold with less than a finger of head. smells yeasty floral slightly malty bready. taste the malt initially and the floral wheat notes shine through. really crisp mouthfeel that makes you want to take another drink soon.
2975,Oberon,3.97,look: turbid orange on the pour which excites a billowing white head to form and hold slowly relenting and leaving sheets of lacing behind aroma: freshly baked wheat bread wheat malt wafts of citrus yeast and light phenolics taste: wheat bread and a ton of it hit hard and fast up front as light citrus notes trickle in behind and join. yeast jumps into the fray in the middle along with light herbal phenolics and wheat yeast and citrus intermingle throughout the close mouthfeel: full silky smooth medium-high carbonation and soft and smooth on the finish overall: i love this beer. i was fortunate enough to try several bell’s beers years ago when they first tried breaking into the oregon market and always had a soft spot for this so was an easy purchase when i saw it locally again. a classic american wheat with lots of tasty wheat character and not heavy on the traditional hefe yeast phenolics so an easy crowd pleaser i feel. well-made delicious and super crushable – what else do you need. recommended
2976,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.59,the beer pours a very bubbly white head that dissipates very quickly. the beer itself is a clear brownish orange color that looks nice.  the smell is very good. it has an orange note upfront with a bit of funk and oak underneath it.  the taste is delicious. it has a strong orange note with a light funk and light toffee finish. there is a light oak note to it.  the feel is very good. the beer has a light body to it but a good texture so that it doesnt feel thin. it has a tingling sensation. the acidity is really nice. its very similar to that of orange juice; not taxing for the average person.  overall a fantastic gueuze thats perfect for the hot weather to drink or to have something during the day. it isnt overly taxing on the palate.
2977,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.39,blend no. 77 season 17|18 bottled 21 sep 18 (based on the best before date this is 2018-09-21) corked and caged 750ml bottle.  clear golden orange fizzy low head. smells funky and bright dirt floor plus flower. tastes wow so much going on. crisp acidity plus funk some overripe fruit flavors coming in waves. feel is outstanding - light and tingly but lasting on the tongue. really good stuff.
2978,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.23,375 ml bottle - season 17/18 blend no. 80  poured a slightly cloudy orange golden in color with off-white colored head. pretty good head retention. aroma and flavor a nice blend of sharp fruity tartness and dry oak tannins and a little funk. nice complexity. medium bodied average carbonation.
2979,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.49,bottled in 2018 drank from a teku glass. a most excellent geuze. complex flavors with a hint of clove and some good sourness (but not too much). very drinkable and refreshing despite its great body and complexity. i will try to find another bottle and let it age longer.
2980,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.5,blend no 57 - season 16|17 - wort from 9 different brews aged in 8 different barrels - bottled november 14th 2017 - enjoyed on december 31 2022. poured from a caged-and-corked 750ml bottle into my drie de fonteinen tumbler.  not quite clear amber body with an active champagne fist receding to a small fine cap. vague sloppy lacing; no legs. very good retention.  subtle yet complex aroma - herbaceous and floral with a delicate funk bringing to mind superior washed rind cheese.  palate entry brings to mind alfalfa fields sorrel and salty sea breezes. tart but not bracingly so. low earthy bitterness comes and goes. goat milk lanolin crisp malt and raw nuts. finishes dry with earth minerality umami and a hint of funk.  medium-light bodied well carbonated nearly refreshing but still soft.  hard to find a more authentic example of the style - rich complex rustic yet refined. reasonable value given the time and labor involved. a good candidate for aging indefinitely.
2981,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.75,pours a rich light orange with ample visible carbonation and a light collar of foam. nose is extremely funky and expressive with elements of dried and wet hay fresh cut crash menthol wood chips pine and sap. the aroma continually evolves and builds on itself throughout the course of the drink. taste follows with an equal complexity and expresses many of those notes from the nose. theres a deep earthiness that underlies it as well evocative at one moment of the smells of a forest floor or the flavor of a cave aged cheese the next. overall this beer does not stop working until its gone. remarkable and easily one of the best.
2982,Leaner,4.69,just starting off by saying this beer is just stupid good now that i have that out the way ill continue with more detail. the pour of the beer isnt anything overly special typical golden orange color rapidly fading white head. the smell of the beer has that fruity casey-like funk going on which is expected. the taste is honestly one of the best tasting peach sours ive had. i was truly blown away by the sweet yet tart peach flavor they were able to get out of this incredible! the feel is medium bodied finished dry and tart. overall just outstanding!
2983,Leaner,4.42,had on tap. bright yet somewhat pale yellow opaque body with a white head and trace amounts of lacing. smell has big peach with effervescent bright oak wild yeast flowers and pollen aromas. taste leads with peach juice and funk playfully sour bright oak flowers wild yeast a whisper of biscuit and apricot support. feel is medium bodied smooth lightly tart and wild bright. nothing earth shattering but a great wild peach saison
2984,Leaner,4.48,look - yellow with a slight hugh and nice white head smell - nice peach and tartness taste - peach tartness feel - medium light body with a nice carb overall - just delicious!
2985,Just Outstanding IPA,4.29,canned 04/07/22. a maltier and darker ipa than i expected but still delicious. i’ve never had their citra dipa but i imagine this is a near polar opposite. rich caramel malt complement the earthy hops. a nice change of pace.
2986,Just Outstanding IPA,4.29,just outstanding canned 05/03/22 looks super good rich orange hazy with a big thick head smells of fruit citrus and malt. the taste is really nice with the apricot like flavor. only hints of citrus and clove that finishes slightly dry and bitter. overall a very nice ipa from california and my beloved @raulmondesi thanks for sharing.
2987,Just Outstanding IPA,4.25,getting back to basics the american ipa has never celebrated bitterness better than in its west coast varieties. kern rivers take on the sub-style is just bitter just dry just clean and just refreshing. all in all its just outstanding!  so just outstanding ipa gets going with a bubbly pour of hazy golden and orange hues. as its frothy white cap tops the rim the common but clean and sharp fragrance of citrus botanicals spruce and peppery hops create a nearly citronella character on the nose. simple and sweet in its malt profile the beers early taste is redolent with lighter versions of caramel honey toasted nuttiness and crust in a slight granola kind of way.  as the hops unfold on the middle palate the simply blossom with citrus flavor. branch-ripe tangerine coupled with ruby red grapefruit and the brightness of lime and a juicy impression of citrus evolve. a background of pineapple and lighter mango add a rounded fruitiness to the hops for a complex and flavorful balance. as the malt influences starts to dissolve off the tongue the juiciness of citrus fades and its bitterness begins to take its place providing strong impressions of pine sap fruit peels peppery grasses and herbs and an overall botanical gin-like counterpart once the alcohol flavors arrive.  medium bodied and trending lighter dry crisp and highly refreshing the relatively error-free ipa is a remarkably brewed ipa thats a standout in a crowded ipa market. finishing snappy and lingering with bitterness the session concludes with a comforting hop bite.
2988,Just Outstanding IPA,4.4,16 ounce can into plastic cup in my orange tustin hotel room. canned on 2/11/22. pours very hazy golden amber/light orange color with a 1 finger dense and creamy off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. dense soapy lacing down the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. aromas and flavors of big red grapefruit tangerine pineapple apricot mango honeydew melon passion fruit berries citrus peel/rind wood pepper pine wheat bread dough herbal floral grass and yeast earthiness. light-medium pine citrus peel/rind herbal floral grassy spicy bitterness on the finish. medium carbonation and medium-plus body. creamy/bready malts some sticky hops and light resins in the mouthfeel. soft finish with lingering resin dryness and no hop astringency. minimal warming 6.8% or hop burn after the finish. amazing simcoe and amarillo profile. super juicy hops with some dank and earthy notes and a soft hazy malt backbone. loved the hop profile as expected.
2989,Just Outstanding IPA,4.37,very bold color nose and flavors. pours darker than most ipas with a tanned color. head was white that disappeared into nice lacing. nose is malty with piney. taste bittery and lots of malt. very nice change from the typical ipa.
2990,Just Outstanding IPA,4.22,a very good option for a traditional american ipa. beautiful orange body with a great head and lacing. smell is a bit light with a hint of maltiness in the middle and citrus at the back. taste is good albeit uneven: it packs a juicy front but dissipates quickly. feel is exactly where it should be--its full in the front and middle--even as it fades a bick quickly. it is exactly what it should be.
2991,Parabola,4.74,poured from a bottle. 2023 vintage.   appearance - body is black as the night with a dark brown short head that disappears into some wispy bubbles. the dark brown head was expected and didn’t disappoint.  smell - malty and molasses chocolatey and some boozy bourbon hints. not overpowering but pleasant.  taste -malty right away. some coffee tones and darker fruits. smooth chocolate finish with some mild hints of booze. great taste and pleasantly surprised by the subdued alcohol boozy presence throughout the sampling. very rich beer.  feel -lower carbonation minimal boozy sting and a lighter body than expected.  overall - great beer that i feel privileged to try. i couldn’t drink many of these in one sitting as they are pretty rich but a very enjoyable beer everyone should sample.
2992,Parabola,4.63,2011 edition from the bottle at home with humiston. just great all around.
2993,Parabola,4.57,firestone walker brewing co. parabola 2015 $10/10 oz. on tap @ falling rock tap house co on 6 october 2019  notes: labeled at 14% abv. very dark brown-black body beneath a short head of tan. malty in the nose with notes of dark malt bourbon roastiness charred oak vanilla and coconut. the flavor is intense. it\s malty sweet and a touch hot from the alcohol with notes of coffee-like roastiness bourbon milk chocolate dark chocolate plum molasses charred oak caramel vanilla and coconut. it\s full bodied on the lower end and remarkably smooth and creamy. there aren\t too many beers like this one. review #8682
2994,Parabola,4.69,poured from the bottle into a cool tulip glass. 2023 vintage. consumed at approx. 50 degrees f.  l: solid jet black. very slight desaturated brown head. s: strong sweet chocolate nose a bit of something like caramel and even some coconut. a bit of booze. t: dark coffee and chocolate brownie not terribly sweet. again something akin to lightly toasted coconut flakes. surprisingly there seems to be some more acidity than i was expecting. big boozy finish. f: a bit lighter than expected but still fairly heavy. slight carbonation. moderately warming. o: a brighter stout than i was expecting but still fantastic. just the right amount of warmth and plenty of rich dark and sweet flavors to play with. one of the best stouts ive had.
2995,Parabola,4.55,2021 vintage. pours a very dark cola brown half-inch tan collar of head that leaves wisps of lacing. nose is big on whiskey and rye along with wood vanilla char licorice molasses brown sugar; aromas really gel and round at as it warms. flavor is equally complex - lots of spice from the rye sweet molasses wood canadian whiskey light vanilla sugar in the raw. it manages to avoid becoming an overly boozy nightmare while still highlighting the spirit barrels all without loading up on sugars and adjuncts. mouthfeel is thick and chewy though not so much as bcbs; theres also some light carb as well. pretty exceptional.
2996,Parabola,4.37,12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip. 2023 release  l: clear dark brown and oily has legs half inch of red-hued light brown head recedes to a tight creamy foam ring. s: bourbon barrel fairly strong alcohol as it warms notes of fig and molasses-like dark sugars come out. t: bourbon barrel and alcohol roasted malt bitter dark chocolate notes of dark fruit finishes with a woody hop tang f: medium-full body medium carbonation smooth and creamy small viscous oat feel finishes with some heat. o: a big sipping ris a little hot the alcohol character dominates still really good.
2997,Parabola,4.51,2023 release: l: as youd expect motor oil s: big bourbon & cherry nose with a little coffee. t: taste follows with chocolate vanilla & oak. the malts are subtle and tannins from the barrels provide a pleasant counterbalance. cherry flavour lingers a long while but does not dominate. f: neither thick nor thin o: always love a parabola.
2998,Parabola,4.83,l: poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer - jet black pour with a decent head appearing. about 3 fingers length to be exact. no lacing left behind as the foam dissolves back into liquid form. s: getting a sweet bourbon cherry aroma from the first sniff can definitely smell some coffee chocolate vanilla and oak in there. very well done on the nose! it hit all the marks that they advertised and it was very noticeable/ well balanced. this deserves a 5/5 for me. t: tasting bourbon cherry up front as the nose indicates. getting some big coffee chocolate vanilla and oak as the nose followed. its rare the nose is tasting the exact same in a similar order to the nose. f: a good sipper - easy to sip in my opinion full bodied medium acidity. o: i can see why this is a world class beer. this big 13.5% beer showed us what we can expect on the firestone walker website and this is exactly what we got. i tried to look for more flavors and one can argue it can have some dark fruits but i would say its pretty rare a beer company hits it spot on and actually tastes good. good job firestone i applaud you for this one.
2999,Parabola,2.9,2022. it didn\t taste like a russian imperial stout to me too sweet in fact i think rasputin is a better representative. and forget about comparing it to sam smith\s ris. i was thankful the bourbon still came through strong which did a lot for the taste. i think the most noticeable things about this beer are its abv of 14.1% and it\s weight both of which put it in the one-and-done category...and that\s if you can finish the 12 oz bottle which i was barely able to do after about 2 hours from the time i poured it. the abv and the weight really work against the enjoyability of this beer.
3000,Parabola,4.63,drinking a 2017 which ive had in the cellar. i am not an expert on the true evaluation of the ris but i fell in love with this one after my first trip to firestone/walker in el paso de robles about 12 or 13 years ago. this started me on ris style. f/w have a cellar room where you can buy the good stuff. i recommend a visit as the wine country out there is fabulous and f/w is affiliated with many of the wineries (sourcing casks mixers etc). the beer is complex and has so many taste notes to it that i wont try to guess them all. it should satisfy almost anyone. i highly recommend putting one away for a few years. i have a few more. tonight my wife is celebrating her 60th and i will be having a 5 year old deschutes abyss or two after the tomahawk ribeye bbq tonight. but for now nothing better to set off this great celebration than my all time favorite parabola!
3001,Parabola,4.65,2021 vintage 12 ounce bottle poured at 53° into a firestone walker snifter. perfect brown head rises above a deep black sea and leaves a nice ring inside the glass. drizzly lacing. smells wonderful - dark malt chocolate coffee prune licorice barrel char. drinking like a millionaire. all of the aromas spill forth into the mouth and everybody takes a bow. multiple barrels makes for a taster’s experience. the peppery spice of the rye barrel carries long which helps cut into the sweet elements of this russian imperial stout. vanilla. fudge. barrel.. on and on. feel is not overly dense which i appreciate. medium carbonation. overall - world class stout and totally worthy. the art of the craft!
3002,Workhorse IPA,4.12,look: rich clear deep/dark reddish-orange with a good head that settles in leaving good lacing aroma: citrus fruits some dank some fir and pine notes blueberries freshly baked bread lingering in the background taste: follows the nose but much more pronounced. citrus fir needles (orange) and dank up front followed by hints of blueberry. good maltiness holds it all together. good bite and medium dryness on the finish mouthfeel: medium carbonation silky and smooth overall – really good and honestly less carbonated-tasting than i expected especially given the freshness overall: this is tasty stuff. this used to be a go-to for me for some time but then i got away from it so glad i was able to be reacquainted as this is really good. a well-made and great balanced wcipa that is readily available fresh in these parts. i’m sure it didn’t hurt just how stinking fresh this is too – i’m consuming it five days after it was canned (canned 6/4/20 drank 6/9/20)
3003,Workhorse IPA,4.18,had this on 2019-05-30 in portland or at the brewery.
3004,Workhorse IPA,4.51,a good consistant solid ipa. even out of a can. money well spent. i was quite surprised as my previous encounters with workhorse were in a bottle. which was good too.
3005,Workhorse IPA,3.99,12 ounce can dated 12/11/18. poured into tulip glass. pours a deep orange just off white head. some chill haze but poured out of the can crystal clear. rings and spots of lacing. well presented beer. aromas of grapefruit resiny weed onion/garlic going on. classic west coast. grapefruit orange pith pine tree finish. still some of that garlic and weedy notes at the end. thick syrupy mouthfeel at first which leads to a lighter finish. this beer packs a huge hop punch. i usually don’t care for the big resiny/weed beers but the citrus hop profiles help to balance some of that out.
3006,Workhorse IPA,4.89,fresh and crisp. bright finish
3007,Workhorse IPA,3.53,a thanks to the captain of the canquest woodychandler for this beer. poured from a 12 oz. can. has a golden/orange color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of citrus peaches some pine. taste has lots of pine very bitter light peaches hints of alcohol. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer.
3008,Workhorse IPA,4.25,i’ve had way better ipas but honestly this really is a workhorse - i committed to a 6 pack and greatly enjoyed all 6. and approachable and easy drinking ipa that may become my go-to for the summer. june 2018. portland or. green zebra mart.
3009,Workhorse IPA,4.16,once more the tavour service comes through for the canquest (tm) is a big way! i may not be buying many bottled beers through them but you can bet your bottom dollar that i am snapping up cans as they become available.  from the can: huge hop flavor and aroma in a balanced northwest-style ipa.  i crack!ed open the vent & canmenced a slow gentle glug into the awaiting glass. i was overjoyed when it created two-plus fingers of dense foamy rocky tawny head all on its own without any bidding. color was solid amber (srm = > 7 < 9) with ne-quality clarity. nose was utterly resinous with pine & now my hophead mouth was watering! think of it - no haze no tropical fruit no b.s.! mouthfeel was medium. the taste was so full of pine that i thought that i was holding the knob end of george bretts bat! mmmm. this was exactly the sort of thing that i had been jonesing for! it had a light woodiness and a little bit of a peach flavor to accompany the intense pine with a bit of biscuitiness. mmmm i was really pleasantly surprised since i thought that this type of beer was either impossible or illegal to produce currently. i jest of course but this was a welcome throwback to the sorts of beers that originally got my attention & made me realize that i am a self-described self-avowed hophead. finish was dry bitter and just the way that i like them. ymmv.
3010,Workhorse IPA,4.46,the problem with some wc style ipa’s is that the brewer puts the abv above the flavor. not on this beer though. this is a well balanced ipa throughly impressed. the smell doesn’t do justice to its mouthfeel & flavor. on the nose i get “basic ipa”.. didn’t expect this flavor. very god wc ipa. worth the trip if you’re in portland.
3011,Flower Power,3.87,an attractively thick head sits atop a lovely hazy orange body. floral aroma with some honey lemon blossoms & pine tar. mildly sweet with a fairly bitter finish. hoppy flavor with citrus pear & pine tar. nice feel. i’m not a fan of ips’s but this one is good
3012,Flower Power,4.07,pours a rich gold with a rocky white two finger head. light citrus aroma maybe some what floral. probably has more but my nose sucks. taste shows some citrus peel a bit of grassiness and some biscuity malt. light/medium bodied with a dry finish and mild carbonation. very tasty warm weather ipa. i’ll be getting this again.
3013,Flower Power,3.99,ahhhhh. i get the west coast pine and grapefruit notes with a touch of new school floral character. just the right bitterness to finish it off. this was a fun one.
3014,Flower Power,5,pleasant surprise. so good.
3015,Flower Power,4.5,look: best looking ipa i have seen in years. perfect sustained head vivid sunset  smell: balanced. floral immediately subsides and becomes a manly almost malty whiff  taste: really balanced middle of the tongue mellow and then stays balanced w wonderful bitters  feel: smooth start to finish  overall: i think this might be the best most balanced beer not just ipa i have had in a long time. the brewers know what they are doing and you sense they are deferring getting out of the way of the ingredients in this masterpiece
3016,Flower Power,3.75,pours a hazy gold. hoppy aroma. big dank hop body. fades to a mild bitterness. thick and syrupy. an old school ipa.
3017,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.52,24oz can lets see what i did to myself...  one the pour 1 finger of bubbly white head formed with surprisingly decent retention leaving a thick but sudsy ring and a slow dissipation to a thin covering on top. body is a golden yellow. as expected no lacing.  aroma is bad like the cheapest oldest bottle of sutter home white wine in your local shitty liquor store. its almost tart. acetaldehyde for days and hints of vinegar.  taste is of course an amplification of the aroma but even dirtier. sweet shitty rosé without the refreshing vibe that then transitions into a lightly malty finish with a dirty bitterness that thankfully doesnt grow. the aftertaste is like wine puke.  feel is at least drinkable but the knowledge of just how terribly made this is makes my body want to reject it. the only way to drink this beer is to take big gulps but thay could lead to intestinal distress. at least you can chug it without completely hating yourself at least completely.  overall this is bad. just buy steel reserve or at least go for the 12.2% alcohol version if you really need to get wasted... and why the hell does this taste like what my palate in high school tasted dry white wine as but sweet..  if you gotta drink it for gods sake dont pour it in a glass.
3018,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.58,camp 900 high gravity lager special reserve xxxxx. 10.50% abv.  to its credit it hides its abv well. the cloying sweetness is rough.  f / avoid
3019,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.11,really with this? awful is the review i came up with
3020,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2.6,the first time i went to las vegas nv i was abruptly introduced to five different versions of camo malt liquor. i purchased and consumed every single variety. this review is based on a singular consumption of 900 high gravity.
3021,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.31,wow! i stole a 24oz. can of this out of a community motel fridge one nite just cuz i wanted a beer it was hot out and everything was closed. wow that was a mistake. horrible from the word go the carbonation wow that is awfull. lot of alcohol but wow not good at all would rather not drink at all!
3022,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.96,mr. can here. there is some really deadly beer in cans and i will tell you about them. yoi!  i got a finger of rocky bone-white head with decent retention. color was a deep golden-yellow with ne-quality clarity. nose had a fruity flavor. hmm. mouthfeel was medium with a fruity flavor. finish was a cheap vinous flavor. this was liquid crack. not recommended for novices.
3023,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1,the top of my can says special reserve ok who are they kidding this is hands down a bottom of the barrel malt liquor. i cracked my can and poured an 8 ounce glass full because i needed to see straight into the eye of the evil hidden behind that aluminum can. pours a dark yellow color with a thick head and constant heavy carbonation. the aroma is revolting the mouthfeel makes me a little woozy and the flavor is simply horrific. overall this strong lager a.k.a. malt likka kikka is a tough sell for me because even if i was looking to get a quick drunk on this beer (term used loosely) is tough to drink. be afraid be very afraid!
3024,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2.51,since no day is a good day to subject myself to malt likkapalooza ix this day is as bad as any other. for todays bout this big silver can of camo 900 will be going up against lucky number high gravity lager. is it possible that camo 900 high gravity tastes different than camo high gravity camo silver ice and camo black ice? only an idiot would do a 4-way malt liquor comparison tasting. hmmm...  camo is urination yellow (if the hobo is dehydrated) with an off-white lid that is by far the better looking of the two. this stuff is actually beginning to deposit some lace on the upper reaches of the glass. who put a good looking beer in my can of boozy malt liquor? this might be the best looking beer of this style that ive ever seen.  neither one of the aromas is overly offensive. this one is sweet and corny with a semi-pleasant floral fruitiness that none of its typical imbibers is likely to appreciate. no great shakes but doable given what style were dealing with.  will wonders ever cease? i didnt think very highly of camo silver ice (for good reason) but this stuff is drinkable if your expectations are in the correct place to start with. the flavor is as simple as a stone and isnt as... ahem... pleasant as the nose but it aint bad either. as always being ice cold helps.  the body/mouthfeel is a bit lighter than the style average and has a just right amount of carbonation. a soft fizziness hits and is then gone allowing the beer to melt in the mouth with a smoothness (relatively speaking) that is unusual in a malt liquor.  either special reserve camo 900 high gravity lager really is better than camo silver ice or im in a malt liqor-receptive mood today. scary thought. anyway malt likkapalooza ix wasnt even close. this stuff almost makes me want to go out and buy some brown paper bags.
3025,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2.36,jeez this is a special reserve beer. what is the reserve a bed in a poison control center?  the pour from the ghetto sized 24 oz can gives you a brew best describes as first piss after the beer fest. clear and yellow with a questionable white froth on top.  smell is sweet corn and fruity ester funk that i normally smell in dogfish head beers. matter of fact this smells exactly like dfh liquor de malt. and i do see that i gave liquor de malt a 3.5 in smell so...  taste is weirdly unflavored just some apples and alcohol burn. near tasteless alcohol delivery device.  mouthfeel is water plus vodka.  drinkability is.... subjective. there are far nastier malt liquors out there and i have tasted them. this is meant for just two types of people hardcore alcoholics and college students...more or less the same thing in some places.  unless you intend to stop going to work and become a wine-o avoid!!!
3026,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2,appears: light pale golden hue bright white head leaves sporadic lacing. aromatics contain sweet sugary fruit notes touch of honey and alcohol wow no real hop character residual sweetness evident corn and rice in harmony...harmony...harmony...thats a naught by nature reference. taste is upfront alcohol ridden along with sugary layers of mild fruit notes with corn and rice evident on the palate. mouthfeel is medium-light bodied slightly syrupy leaves streaks of flavor on the palate with each sip. drinkability: leaves me wanting something hoppier but the alcohol content is there what can i say were having fun sampling malt liquors.
3027,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.4,mine says camo 900. 24 ounce can. light yellow. mildly aromatic with a bit of solvent and dirty fish tank along with grass light grains and alcohol. the flavor is actually pretty unique but still rough corny and grainy. there are only mild off flavors and this isn\x92t quite as good as olde english 800.
3028,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.13,good god almighty. a friend of mine bought me this as a gag. poured a very pale orangey-yellow. smell was of sulphur and rubber.  it tasted of rubber and grain. absolutely bad. really bad.  i dont know how anyone could stand to drink enough of this to get drunk. i drank about 1/4 of it and then dumped the rest.  wow... should have passed the novelty on to someone else so i didnt have had to try it.
3029,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,1.57,pours a gold to light orange hue. one finger head fades along with most of the carbonation in under a minute. typical malt liquor apple cider smell. taste is very sweet almost tangy. low carbonation and no detectable hops leave this beer flat and unbalanced. i guess the thick body and overly sweet flavor are worth struggling through if you aim to get smashed.
3030,Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,2.07,camo 900 high gravity lager pours a classic lager amber from a 24 oz pop top can. the light tan head went over two fingers before turning rocky then settling down to a fine carpet of foam leaving a fair amount of lace along the way. plentiful streams of carbonation are rising to replenish the cap of foam in a seemingly endless supply.  nose is a sweet corn with a floral component followed by the vapors of alcohol. palate is a very sweet corn with some hops bittering not quite in balance with the very sweet corn the hops bittering offsets some but not all of the sweet corn. missing is the burn from the 9% by volume alcohol it is tucked away in the same place as the bite of carbonation in the viscus liquid of this hgl the mouth feel is that of a light syrup.  in the end the sweet corn becomes cloy the bitter has lost the battle and is nowhere to be found. the sides of my glass are still covered in a fine lace. a good deal of ambivalence is going on with the eye candy and the cloy sweet corn.  for me its one time around the block... for some one else i\x92m not so sure.
3031,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.24,purchased as a 24oz can poured into a pint glass.  a - pours a golden color. initially thick foamy white head recedes quickly; poor head retention and no lacing. lots of small bubbles rising through the brew.  s - adjuncts alcohol and malty notes abound. abv is not very well hidden here.  t - malt and sweet corn to start with fusels and a faint sour apple flavor showing up on the finish. not as egregiously tart as stack 101 but its noticeable.  m - thin-bodied with medium carbonation. it goes down relatively easily but the mouthfeel of this hgl leaves much to be desired outside of that.  o - it has a cool can design and the product is inoffensive enough not to be a drain pour but nothing about it really invites me to try it again. tick complete. reviewed to style ymmv.
3032,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.68,a random pickup from a local wine stores cooler i couldnt ask for a lower price on a themed drink to go alongside my d&d game later that day which featured a similar dog creature.  the upsides of this beer stop about there.  while not bad nothing about this beer stood out from under the label. drinking straight from the can i cant speak of colour or clarity though a lager that doesnt try to coat me with the head foam as i open it isnt trying hard enough.  the most appealing feature of this brew seems to be the 24oz can of 8% abv for around $2 since id compare it to the big brand light beers but trying too hard to be bursting with the wrong sort of flavours.
3033,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.94,drank from a 24 ounce can. scores are based on the style.  look - very attractive almost looks like a fancy craft beer. stands out nicely on the shelf. doesnt look at all like a malt liquor.  smell - tiny wisp of corn mostly metallic water.  taste - like a brownie covered in black pepper. incredibly sweet slightly chocolatey and a strong alcohol bite.  feel - thin body very mild fizz and some throat burn. it needs to either be thicker or bubblier.  overall - i had low expectations based on its $1.50 price tag and it hit them. its not good but it isnt offensive. id have it again but it definitely wouldnt be a first pick.
3034,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.05,why am i rating this? the hell if i know lets say desperate times call for desperate measures. poured into what? uhmmmm...just a regular pint glass. the appearance was a glossy clear yellow to mild orange color with speedy carbonation rising to fill a rapidly dieing head. no lace. the aroma had stiff sweet corn rice fusel alcohol and burnt grass. the flavor had a huge alcoholic sweet buffing throwing itself into burnt grass burnt toast and sweet corn. the aftertaste was distracting through fusel alcohol sweet corn and burnt grass and toast. the mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with no sessionability whatsoever. its a sipper by all means thats if one wants to sip it. carbonation did feel appropriate for what this is supposed to be. abv seemed as projected. finish was fusel alcohol sweet corn and burnt toast. overall didnt really like this at all for me but without being too harsh i realize this style doesnt really clean up too well. keep trying maybe a brewer out there eventually will be able to brew a kickass version of this. i seriously doubt this brewery will.
3035,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.89,this beer tastes like watered down natty daddy. it has a slightly greater fruity taste but its subtle. the can is interesting with an orange color and cerberus design. if you want to get buzzed for cheap you cant beat it.
3036,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.94,very smooth for 8% beer. tastes kinda like coors original but nearly twice as strong.
3037,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.6,pours a perfectly crystal clear light yellow. a white fizzy head dies quickly.  aroma of corn spent grain spent hops and fusel alcohol.  flavor has a neutral note almost then the corn and rice sweetness sets in. small stale hop does a little to balance then a soft alcohol note. for 8% it could be more ghastly than it is.
3038,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,5,nasty yellow color but it does product a full inch of head even if it quickly vanishes with no lace no trace. aroma was metallic alcohol.  fuck the body is thin on this lots of corn syrup aluminum and rubbing alcohol. eventually it starts to numb your senses with the alcohol burn and thin body. man i can appreciate some malt liquor but this is asking too much of me.
3039,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.44,a: the beer is clear amber yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation. it poured with a quarter finger high white head that died down leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a thin collar around the edge of the glass. s: light aromas of sweet malts are preset in the nose—corn seems to stand out in particular along with faint hints of alcohol. t: the taste follows the smell but flavors of alcohol start to creep in. there is a lingering aftertaste of alcohol in the finish. m: it feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. o: this beer isnt nearly as offensive compared to some of the other malt liquors that ive had.  serving type: can
3040,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.5,nasty yellow color but it does product a full inch of head even if it quickly vanishes with no lace no trace. aroma was metallic alcohol.  fuck the body is thin on this lots of corn syrup aluminum and rubbing alcohol. eventually it starts to numb your senses with the alcohol burn and thin body. man i can appreciate some malt liquor but this is asking too much of me.
3041,333 Premium Export Beer,2.81,provided during a dinner show at the majestic in saigon poured from the can.  the beer pours a golden amber color with a frothy white head and light lacing. the frothy head dissipated pretty quickly and head retention was fair at best. so this isnt a very impressive looking beer. on the nose things didnt get much better as i picked up sweet canned corn and maybe some light cereal grains. the flavor profile was just more of the same in this lightweight beer with the sweet corn flavor dominating. the beer is pretty watery with at most some light bitterness on the finish. alcohol is undetectable and frankly i was surprised to see the abv. listed as 5.3 (would have guessed less).  this is a pretty unimpressive beer. inoffensive is probably the best thing i can say about it.
3042,333 Premium Export Beer,2.12,(review from 330ml can) light golden colour with little to no head. no distinguish smell with little floral after taste. just another normal asian lager in the market. on a positive note it does go well with vietnamese food which are mostly rich in flavour
3043,333 Premium Export Beer,3.47,can purchased from an import store in tokyo. poured into a ceramic mug.  immediately intrigued by the first sip: a bold rice-y flavor. perhaps because it was my first rice beer but it left a strong impression. very interesting and memorable.
3044,333 Premium Export Beer,3.51,a fresh kind of crisp lager is what this is. smells okay no foul tones on the contrary it is welcoming enough to make you want to taste it - and when you do you don’t regret it. it is very alright for an adjunct (?) lager! no bitterness or metallic aftertaste whatsoever very drinkable very refreshing with mild carbonation. the japanese should try to imitate american adjuncts instead of making a riced up german lager... this is way better.
3045,333 Premium Export Beer,2.82,from a can in vietnam. pours a golden color with a half inch of white head. sweet grass smell. medium feel a little more substantial than other vietnamese beers. malt forward taste dry on finish. my experience seems better than others i guess if you find this fresh and drink it as cold as possible its not bad.
3046,333 Premium Export Beer,3.03,my first in ho chi minh august 13th 2017. everything a macro should be. light crisp and refreshing with hints of hops.
3047,333 Premium Export Beer,2.53,drank from a can on an bang beach outside of hoi an vietnam. accompanied a meal of steamed clams fried fish and stir fried morning glory. our go to spot hosted by the lovely tuyet. have enjoyed this many times.
3048,333 Premium Export Beer,2.3,330ml pull-tab can from a minimart in hanoi. cost was below $0.50 usd. 5.30% abv. brief impressions below:  has an odd adjuncty sweetness to it bending it towards syrupy. definitely artificial in terms of flavour. cheap malt syrup metallic off-flavour pils/pale malts. no noticeable hop character.  overcarbonated. smooth wet unrefreshing medium-bodied (where it ought to be light-bodied).  drinkable as a budget brew when its cold. most vietnamese canned beers seem to blend together with few distinctive characteristics but this is recognizably a notch below the norm.  high d+ (2.50) / not recommended  *** july 11th 2016: 2nd can purchased in hoi an. sabeco owns bia saigon apparently.  the abnormally slender hole left by the pull-tab once opened allows less beer through than most cans which is something of a godsend seeing how ghastly this is.  sweet malt syrup adjunct (corn rice who cares?) stale barley. too sweet too simple and certainly shallow. theres no intricacy or depth of flavour here at all and nothing really to come for save for the 5.30% abv (which ill grant is above average for regional lagers and isnt badly disguised).  not a beer i intend to revisit unless economy demands it even at its reasonable-by-western-standards price. drinkable enough to be fair. weve all had worse but its still pretty poor fare.  d / avoid
3049,Oude Geuze Vintage,4.85,2016 edition from last year. 375 ml bottle. a little oak on the nose. just enough carbonation to make the mouthfeel great. taste makes me want to drink it all day.
3050,Fou' Foune,4.56,a huge thank you to tacosandbeer for this bottle!  a - hazy medium orange gold colored pour with bright white creamy lacing circling the top of the glass.  s - massive tart jammy apricot with a little bit of funk going down.  t - not as sour / tart as the nose would suggest (though still puckering). lots of apricot jam tartness that lingers on the palate (and then some).  m - big body with vibrant carbonation giving a soft texture leaving the entire mouth watering.  o - straight up apricot with just the right amount of twangy zing. pretty darn impressive and something special right here.
3051,Fou' Foune,4.68,poured from 750ml bottle into spencers goblet.  l - pale hazy apricot gold pour with a topping of thin white foam which disperses to a mild lacing.  s - tart sugary apricot jam with perhaps a touch of cinnamon and creamy vanilla.  t - sharp sourness almost vinegary acidity underripe fruit and a slight doughy grain flavor.  f - stinging carbonation juicy to start with a dry finish.  a beautifully crafted lambic which avoids the pitfalls of many other examples of the style (too sweet or too woody). the fruit is used to soften the lambic base. excellent!
3052,Fou' Foune,4.25,on tap at windsor homebrew in anaheim ca.  this one is like van gogh if he was medicated or something: the wildness is still there in its way but now there is balance. it’s all pretty and fine but it’s missing a bit of rage. and who doesn’t like that? good but raul wouldn’t chop an ear off to get another pour.  as it warms so does raul…
3053,Fou' Foune,4.56,look - hazy yellow fantastic rimming nice head smell - fruity slight tart taste - incredible tart fruity apricot feel - medium body crisp dry light carb overall- shocked how good it is!!!
3054,Crusher,4.55,poured from the can into a spiegelau ipa glass. canned june 21st 2023.  hazed and opaque body with a muted orange but fairly dark and still. a mix of custard but has a much darker than expected color. the beer nearly appears frozen. head is quite soapy fine white bubbles of three fingers with light retention. shampoo like top but lots of ring lacing to match.  aroma is a hop surprise. hints of soft dank but a real gumdrop like candy sweetness that matches nicely. thick and rich with a light sense of sweet malt to counter as well. the contrast between dank and sweet hop aroma on this is exceptional. huge juicy dank sweet punch is the only way i can describe it like hop thick kool-aid.  palate brings things a little more into focus but does not hold back. mid palate hits with a hot but delicious earthy mid palate punch. large and bold but controlled hop blasts of pine earth juiced candy orange pineapple and mango rolling into a minty finish that just does not quit. it doesnt stop there with a creamed earthy mouthfeel that feels like a sundae and smells like sweet tilled garden earth.  a bit of a punishing sensation but in a real good way crushing indeed.
3055,Crusher,4.98,this is one of the most underrated ipas out there. great balance hop bitterness and malt. no pun intended but it crushes it.
3056,Crusher,4.9,#154 crushable for sure!
3057,Crusher,4.53,nice beer. more bitter than heady or focal but not overwhelming. to me this tastes more like a west coast dipa. not sure if the abv is off on these but a little goes a long way--these can really sneak up on you.
3058,Crusher,4.68,a-pillowy white head on top of a hazy bright yellow beer s-pine forward dank layered upon a malt base of simple light syrup and caramel m-dry finish for sure with low end carbonation t-earthy pine with a dank twinge and complex flavours that are almost savoury. o-quite the conundrum of a brew very west coast old school ipa with the bitter notes playing a leading role
3059,Crusher,4.23,poured from a can with no visible date into a teku. can purchased on 8/15/22 from the alchemist.  l- beautiful opaque deep golden color.  s- some “dank” along with a hint of pine.  t- up front piney bite but not overpowering.  f- moderate carbonation  dry finish.  o- a fantastic dipa! not too sweet and juicy not too resiny. just perfect!
3060,Crusher,4.6,5/12/22 canned 2/23/22. this is one powerful brew. flavorful. hops forward. perfect piney bitterness. dry finish. citrus. thirst quenching. could be a favorite. it is!
3061,Crusher,4.84,appearance: the alchemist crusher new england ipa has a golden hazy appearance with a creamy white head.  aroma: the aroma is a combination of citrus and tropical fruit such as grapefruit orange and mango with hints of pine.  taste: on the palate the beer is smooth and juicy with a balanced blend of sweet and bitter flavors. the tropical fruit and citrus notes are prominent and there is a slight hop bitterness in the finish.  mouthfeel: the mouthfeel is soft and creamy with a medium body and a slight carbonation.  overall impression: the alchemist brewing crusher new england ipa is a delicious and refreshing beer with a well-balanced flavor profile. it is an excellent example of the new england ipa style and it is perfect for a warm day or to pair with a spicy meal. the aroma taste and mouthfeel all work together to create a satisfying drinking experience.
3062,Curmudgeon,4.12,a 2016 version poured out of a 32oz crowler that i picked up @ sll in sept. 21. i’ve always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beer’s full spectrum of aromas and flavors. this is one of the most inviting beers if based on looks alone - a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber. the aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker sweet dried fruits on a raisin toast-like malt base. there is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oak-barrel bourbon-like alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base. as it warms there’s nutty/hazelnut caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste. if there’s a moment where the hops shine it’s mid-finish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy. medium to full-bodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy. i haven’t had many old ales as of late and the [english] one’s i remember were quite different. overall for someone who really likes big complex aged ales - this beer is a standout.
3063,Curmudgeon,3.83,355 ml bottle from voldby købmandsgaard. abv is 9.8%. 50 ibu. cloudy brown colour low beige head of poor retention. sweetish malty aroma notes of caramel and oak hints of dark dried fruits and alcohol. not as sweet flavour as i feared malty and oaky caramel and dried figs well balanced with the hops a nice bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. would buy again.
3064,Curmudgeon,4.5,just about as beautiful a brew can be. a request for a pint came from a tap in a clear glass vessel. the color is a dark copper bright yet not translucent. the head is just barely biege enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing. the aroma is malty almost stout-like malty. this is also good inside the mouth. its rich sweet smooth and malty. but thats not all. molasses and hops bring an earthiness that without being bitter enhance what would make a good ale like a wee heavy scottish ale. the almost 10% abv is unnoticed. that its on the heavy side is a good thing for any lighter it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer. overall complexly excellent.
3065,Curmudgeon,4.45,16oz mason jar on tap from the craft beer hop shop
3066,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.6,2021 batch 3 drank in june 2022. didnt get as much from this as previous adwtd. felt sweet without complexity that you would expect. still very delicious just not worth the price.
3067,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,5,complex and boozy hits all the right barley wine notes but adds so much more. fruity sweet but not cloying. thick but not too heavy just all around outstanding.
3068,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.35,my first sacrifice at dark lord day 2023 (its back baby!!!) this screenprinted batch 1 triple oak label--sporting those the aussie stickers with pride--poured a mildly viscous clear reddish-copper with nary a head to speak of though ringed by a bubbly tan chain.  intensely woody up front it even leans a little pungent and catty right out of the bottle. however it quickly transforms into an explodingly delectable maple tempered by a whiskey heat that both continue to expand on the exhale and with each subsequent sip.  though this definitely shows its age its quite the experience nevertheless. still im not sure anything can beat my nostalgia for the original cognac-only bomber despite my double oak rating being the highest of all three.
3069,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.75,as good as it gets. from the bottle at rosada ranch on 04/02/23.
3070,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.84,this is a special one. i wanted to crack this while reading brandon sanderson\s tress of the emerald sea. so i did.  apppearance is dark brown just a shade brighter than a cup of coffee. definitely some translucence.  nose is just a cacophony of oak bourbon dark bread with plum jam apple butter caramel soaked raisins and coconut. wow. simply exquisite. the nose is expressive but not overbearing. restrained.  the taste follows the nose perfectly. sweet dark fruit like plum date and fig combined with caramel and brown sugar rich breadiness oak apple cherry baking spices. everything works perfectly with each other.  mouthfeel is full bodied. not thick or syrupy either. not too cloying. a little bit of evaporation to counteract. some tannins to dry. it fits well in this regard. it doesnt hang too heavy on the palate.  overall this is stellar brew. i cant think of many words to really capture how absolutely amazing this experience is. a product crafted by masters in thier field and it shines through brilliantly.
3071,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.6,2022 vintage  review 1600! ive saved a truly legendary beer for this milestone review the highest rated american barleywine on ba and 13th highest rated overall. i just had the double oak version yesterday and it was damn good so i have high hopes for this. lets crack this beast open and see what its all about  pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a nothing and leaves no lacing but with fantastic legs  in the nose its also quite similar to double oak though with some more barrel presence. im picking up on aromas of earthy bourbon charred oak molasses burnt caramel plum black cherry cognac toasted coconut sweet vanilla old leather light fig and toffee  the booze is more forward here but it pushes such wonderful complexities in taste that it actually adds to the experience. on the front end of the sip im tasting cocoa powder black cherry cognac toasted oak sweet bourbon honey molasses dark toast fig sweet vanilla raisin light toffee and tobacco. the swallow brings notes of leather smoky tobacco charred oak molasses fig black cherry toasted coconut port wine plum cacao nib burnt caramel brown sugar and light walnut  a full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a rich and silky beer. finishes a tad sticky but the boozy tingle dries it out over time  this is incredible. the double oak version was great too but this one edges it out. definitely a beer ill remember for years to come
3072,Light Beer,1,tastes like battery acid.
3073,Light Beer,2.43,first off i dont like any light beers. im a guinness stout guy. however ill concede theres times when a heavier brew isnt the thirst quencher of choice. like when the temp soars in the nineties and you would just about drink water as your preferred thirst quencher. thats is a time for light beer and this ones is about as un-offensive as it gets. it reminds me of keystone for those times....at an even better price. its really light tasting. not too much adjunct taste or hops bitterness. it really quinces a thirst. its easy to drink period. for a basement priced brew for those who want to quaff it down this stuff rules. i think it gets no love first because of the segment and second because of the price. really? what are we reviewing here. for the segment it competes in and at the price it goes for this is a singularly good product. i know its like the third or whatever generation of kirklands offerings in the light beer segment. i think its good enough that they should settle on this on and offer it indefinitely.
3074,Light Beer,2.6,i’ve rated every quality of this low and yet the overall score is a 3.5. why? because for a measly $22 you can get 48 of these bad boys. 48. at least where i live you’ll pay 21 for 24 coors an equally shitty beer in my opinion. for its purpose you won’t find a better deal and that’s its appeal. yellow color hardly any taste no head yet $44 will get an entire college party popping. you know what you’re getting and to the end this is great.
3075,Light Beer,1.18,it was water not beer it is a shame they even put the word beer on the can.
3076,Light Beer,2.68,a: pours a crystal clear pale yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint pale golden yellow colored highlights. the beer has a finger tall fizzy bright white head that quickly reduces to a small patch of very thin film and a very thin ring at the edges of the glass. minimal amounts of lacing are observed.  s: moderate aromas of grainy malts with moderate amounts of corn adjunct sweetness and just a hint of grassy hops.  t: upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of grainy malts with moderate amounts of rice + corn adjuncts along with a light amount of corn sweetness. that is followed by very light flavors of grassy hops which contribute a light to moderate amount of lingering bitterness.  m: light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. crisp.  o: while not a style that i generally seek out this beer was not offensive like some of the other budget offerings in the style. easy to drink with a crisp light mouthfeel and well hidden alcohol. i would not go out of my way to seek this out again but i was pleasant surprised.  note: this was received in thanks from a total stranger in the costco parking lot for helping him to load a couple of adirondack chairs into his vehicle.
3077,Light Beer,1.44,oof you have no idea how badly i wanted this beer to be good. at about 40 cents per can i had the highest hopes for this beer to be a crisp and refreshing one. instead i am greeted on the nose with an oddly sweet and undeniably moscato-like smell. the taste retains this sweetness but brings in quite a bit of funk as well. this beer is just too flavorful to be a beer for getting drunk with nothing to enjoy about it in the first place. very bad beer
3078,Light Beer,2.7,when i drink light beer i usually drink miller lite. its not like it has a great flavor-- its just what i drink when it goes on sale at rite aid for under a buck a can. when i saw this at costco for .50 a can i thought id give it a shot. well its not really as good as miller lite. you know how in restaurants when you order a soda water they bring it to you with a slice of lime? this beer tastes exactly like that. a lime citrus taste. its not unpleasant and is probably really nice on a hot day after hours of back-breaking work. it has the same alcohol content as miller lite at half the price but double the carbs and half the taste.
3079,Light Beer,1.92,this is an alright college beer that i wouldnt recommend you buy.  you absolutely cannot beat the price for these but they taste worse than pretty much any light or ice beer ive ever had.  stick with pbr.
3080,Light Beer,3,12/31/17 can
3081,Light Beer,2.67,well it is christmas time and travels with family. figured i needed to try this. very similar to a busch light. where was this in college at $21 for 48 beers!?!?
3082,Light Beer,1.06,the alcohol content is lower than any beer i have ever purchased personally but the most important thing to comment on is the subpar disgustingly flat taste in this fermented water. the taste or headache isnt quite as bad as bud light but it gets close. i just find it disappointing that such a large company would choose such a low grade beer to put their label on. if it was closer in taste to say pabst blue ribbon or even as low as coors light id give 5 stars across board but its not even close. on the plus side the price for the quantity is unbeatable and i will most likely continue to purchase this beer and its hangovers because of this as well as how good the company treats its customers.
3083,Light Beer,2.03,this is my favorite light lager. it has a mildly enjoyable caramel flavor but no head retention smell or real body. regardless of price point its better than bud light coors light etc. considering the price point wow! my buddy and i went to costco the other day and saw these. $9.97 for 48. yep we did a double take too and then we bought three. what a deal.
3084,Light Beer,1.65,this is the second try. it said new taste and while it is less fruity it is even more watered down. very poor. i’m sad i have 47 more.
3085,The Great Pumpkin,4.57,liquid pumpkin pie with smell and flavor exactly in line with the label description: pumpkin cinnamon nutmeg cloves and allspice. heavier body than i expected but very nice glean finish. score is only diminished by the suspended solids but at least the label warns that they might be present.
3086,The Great Pumpkin,4.39,wow this pumpkin elysian 12 pack continues to impress. 2nd beer and this one packs a punch while also being extremely well balanced. pours pale amber and smell is pumpkin cinnamon nutmeg and caramel. what scent! screams autumn. mouth feel may be a bit thin but makes it more sessionable. high abv so be careful. cant go wrong with this beer.
3087,The Great Pumpkin,3.33,aroma is practically nonexistent faint pumpkin spice. the body is pretty much solely pumpkin with some spice baking it up. satisfying body very spiced and nice carbonation. yup its pumpkin.
3088,The Great Pumpkin,4.4,one of the best beers i have had. well balanced and not too strong on the flavors. will buy again and again. tastes like a pumpkin with the right combination of spices.
3089,The Great Pumpkin,3.85,light amber thin white head ok retention splotchy lace smells like pumpkin spice light toasty and caramel malt underneath pumpkin spice can actually taste pumpkin a bit of caramel malt medium bodied and appropriately carbonated. still heavy on the spice but the best so far out of this mixed pack
3090,The Great Pumpkin,4.33,cloudy and dark orange light sediments shaking around the bottom of the glass. small light brown head with poor retention and lacing. good pumpkin smell on nose. great flavors malt raw pumpkin pumpkin pie very good. average feel good finish. very good the best of elysian’s pumpkin beers by far.
3091,The Great Pumpkin,3.97,l: pours an orange amber color with a small white head and no lacing on the glass.  s: a strong cinnamon and pumpkin pie aroma followed by a graham cracker crust and notes of pumpkin.  t: lots of pumpkin pie spice followed by pumpkin and some graham cracker crust feels like fall.  f: smooth slightly creamy mouthfeel with a medium to large body.  o: this is a very nice pumpkin beer.
3092,Scaled Way Up,4.56,no age on this one filled in a growler on 3/12/20. i believe its 3-4 weeks since brewing.  pours a nearly completely opaque golden yellow straw with a finger of creamy head that dissipated rather quickly. big nose of mango dried peach candied ruby grapefruit cara cara orange slight bubblegum pineapple over-ripened apricot and portuguese sweet bread. just bursting with a sweet candied tropical fruit aroma love it. tons of flavor on first sip all the notes of the nose melded together well with an addition of over-ripe papaya slight dankness honeydew melon and a little bit of pine resin. im so glad i got a 64oz growler of this one! so good! wonderful soft slightly resin-y medium body but i kinda wish it had just a tiny bit more fullness. medium- bitterness medium drying medium- prickly carbonation.. today was my first time on jury duty and im glad i stopped by trillium for this one i cant think of a better brew to relax with after a long day.
3093,Promised Land,4.24,16 oz can.  pours a crystal clear amber orange color with a large fluffy khaki head. great head retention; bubbles for days. leaves some sticky cobweb lacing.  lots of bready malts and cereal grains on the nose. grassy herbal and lightly sweet with hints of citrus and honey. woody earthy and rustic.  the flavor has a nice honey character up front followed by cereal grains doughy malt toasted bread grass citrus and herbal hops on the finish.  the feel is medium-light bodied with good carbonation. lightly crisp with a dry finish.  overall this is just a great beer. im not well-versed in this style but it seems to be just about what is expected from a good representation with a little tree house flair. could drink these all year.
3094,Promised Land,4.08,tree house has really been going all in in the classics styles lately but seeing them attack something as obscure as a steam beer is a move i did not see coming. nonetheless i’m excited to try their take on this uncommon style. let’s get into it  pours a cloudy reddish orange with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  it’s nicely balanced in the nose between toasty and herbal notes. i’m picking up on aromas of brown toast biscuity malt cereal grain herbal hops wildflower honey light orange blossom and grass  it’s not quite as snappy in taste unfortunately but it’s still enjoyable. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting biscuity malt sweet honey floral hops orange zest brown bread light tea and lemon. the swallow brings notes of brown toast cereal grain wildflower honey orange zest tea light grass and floral hops  a light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a crisp and floral beer. finishes neutral and slightly sweet  this one’s definitely different and i would’ve preferred a little more bite to it but it’s still very good
3095,Promised Land,3.78,16 oz can no date  dark copper in color thick cream colored head. very good head retention and lacing. aroma of toasty malt and earthy hops. taste is a bit sweet. medium bodied. easy drinking
3096,Promised Land,4.72,had on tap at sandwich. pours slightly murky copper in color with one quarter inch head. taste is toasted bready malt black tea and light earthy hops. light bodied moderate carbonation slightly bitter. i have a greater appreciation for this style after going to the united kingdom. this is not a hop slam of flavors that i am used to from tree house. rather it reminds me of a good english pale. this is my new favorite in the style if not for the fact that i didnt fully appreciate anchor when i had it.
3097,Reality Czeck,4.59,from city brew tours canned may 23rd.  it pours a pale gold with a couple of fingers of foam lacing is very good.  the smell is noble hops bread grassy lovely overall aromas.  the taste is nice grassy noble hops some bread a bit spicy...this is what i imagine that a bohemian pilsner should smell and taste like.  medium bodied lively carbonation.  superb!
3098,Reality Czeck,3.98,clear bright yellow body; sparse carbonation; huge frothy white head good creamy texture rocky; thick rings of foam encircle the glass. mild light grain aroma; biscuit and sweetly spicy; a bit floral. well-balanced flavors comprising light biscuit and cracker taste and a fairly mild hop bitterness; mineral presence; peppery spiciness. medium body; crisp and lightly prickly on the palate; semi-dry overall.  overall a very nice pilsner. its crisp and clean with a nice depth of character and having a nice rounded balance of flavors looks and mouthfeel.  pouring temperature: 42 °f; canning info: 10/10/22
3099,Reality Czeck,3.79,clear golden pour with a 3 finger white head. the head retention is quite good and it took a long time to pour the beer into the glass. slight malt/grain nose. a bit of bread biscuit here. the flavor is malty as expected. the flavor has a lot of grain in it. bread and biscuit. slight earthy flavor. theres a slight bit of bitterness on the back from the hops. light crisp clean body. easy drinking and delicious.
3100,Reality Czeck,4.35,poured at fridge temp from a can. pours a wonderful transparent yellow with a good amount of white head. solid lacing. bubbles rising at a moderate speed throughout. the nose is great. wheat banana apples slight citrus a floral note and grass.  the taste is fantastic. a nice fruity sweetness hits first with a transition to a hoppy note on the back end. grainy dry prickly banana apricot grassy earthy and a slight peppery spice. super flavorful.  mouthfeel is really crisp and refreshing. dry.
3101,Reality Czeck,4.27,new brewery for me courtesy of @beersnake1  brewers notes: a delicate soft lager authentic to the west coast of the czech republic.  huh! a coast is a land mass adjacent to a body of water . i guess germany and france have been moved into the atlantic ocean  canned 10.10 opened 11.22 poured into a spiegelau ipa glass clear golden liquid active carbonation streams  fluffy two finger white foam cap  good retention  settles yo a mounded island  spotty lacings  aroma is clean grassy  taste is grassy   mouthfeel is low sudsing sweet  clean crisp   good beer
3102,Reality Czeck,5,the best czech style pilsner i have had not surprised to see it ranked number one here. incredibly crisp with clean malt that lingers throughout the palette. the lacing is also just a joy to watch incredible.
3103,Reality Czeck,4.04,16oz. can served in a willibecker. canned on 04/25/2022. pours a lovely golden yellow with a tight creamy 1.5 inch bright white head that slowly collapses in on itself. lovely nose - clean and grassy with a big hit of noble hops. taste consistent with nose with the addition of a light lemony character. finish is slightly medicinal and bitter. mouthfeel is light in body with an assertive carbonation that finishes semi-dry. overall quite lovely but not as delicate as i would have liked to have seen.
3104,Reality Czeck,4.4,look: nice clear amber with a thick white head lots of carbonation  smell: nice clean malt and hop notes  taste: very crisp relatively hoppy with just a hint of malt  feel: very bubbly
3105,Reality Czeck,4.4,ive always been a german pilsner guy but this one converted me. wow! easily the best czech pils ive ever had.
3106,Reality Czeck,4.8,the best representation of anything you’ll find in the czech republic. amazingly thirst quenching and genre defining. my all time fav moonlight beer. never stop making this.
3107,Reality Czeck,4.33,a little bitter on the finish.
3108,Modelo Light,2.13,id like this one much more if it had somewhere around 4% abv - at 2% abv it just isnt worth drinking... tastes like watered down corona light... which means it tastes like water with extra water
3109,Modelo Light,1.9,appears very slightly yellow color with a foamy head that dropped quickly and no lacing. smells very lightly bready corn lightly floral. taste follows the nose. mouth feel is very keen light for the style watery. overall i dont like light beers but if you do? you might like it. i probably wouldnt order again.
3110,Modelo Light,3.08,a lot like regular only thinner along with malts and a beery finish. was expecting it to be very light but drinkable and that pretty much sums it up.
3111,Modelo Light,2.12,straight from the bottle to wine glass very cold beer appearance: light pale yellow minimal head a lot of lacing aroma: scent smell of malt nothing else taste: not really great mouth feel: very carbonated overall: good beer for the hot weather
3112,Modelo Light,1.63,watered down modelo especial... less flavor less calories less adepts. modelo made this in response to tecate light a very succesfull beer in mexico but it´s not even close in sales or fans.
3113,Amstel Light,3,12oz bottle nest by november 2023  on a hard pour 2 fingers of bubbly white head formed on top of a clear golden body. some lacing is left.  aroma is immediately skunks in a weedy sort of way. not super off perhaps it intentional. some crackery malt in the back.  taste is very thin with a slight crackery malt as well as that skunks bitterness. not terrible for being light. slightly funky right at the front. does taste like lager beer.  feel is thin and watery with a slight dryness. this feels like almost nothing if it werent for a dryness that l is present. refreshing at least.  overall its a heineken adjacent light lager. meh but not bad.
3114,Amstel Light,4.2,i dont know why the ipa beer snobs are killing this beer. i personally prefer an ipa over a lager any day however if you want a light lager you cant go wrong with amstel light. very refreshing beer. whenever i bring amstel light to a party people respond by saying that they have not had an amstel in a while. however for some reason they are the first to go. great summer beer when you want to have a few.
3115,Amstel Light,4.17,if you are drinking light beer it is the best that i like. hard pass on the other major brands light beers!
3116,Amstel Light,5,the best light pilsner you can buy!
3117,Amstel Light,3.64,pours a pale straw color with a quick receding white head smell is basically earthy grains. taste is light maltiness with a nice crisp hop bite. feel is crisp and refreshing light bodied finishes semi dry. overall for a light beer this is not bad at all. it is thin and lacking flavor(but we are talking about basically a 3/2 beer) for what it is the ratings do not reflect the quality. high abv stouts (even crappy ones) get above a 4 if the abv is above an eight. i am judging this for what it is. a weak3/2 beer.
3118,Amstel Light,3.24,l - poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a sam adams perfect glass. one and a half fingers of light off white head on an aggressive pour. fades to a lightly foamy film. lacing shows on agitation but quickly returns to liquid. lots of carbonation showing from the nucleation in the glass that is easy to see through the clear light straw color.  s - honey and crackers up front. and thats really it.  t - sweet honey and bready cracker taste follows scent. maybe even some hints of cornbread. very very minor crispness in the middle but really muted and fades fast. the sweetness of the flavor is pleasant and not skunky at all like some other reviewers have experienced. no real bitterness to speak of.  f - thin mouthfeel like other light beers but not total water. a nice amount of minor carbonation. very easy to drink  o - overall this is one of the better mass produced light beers i’ve tried. it actually has a palatable and pleasant (if not straightforward) flavor profile. at this time i’m not normally reaching for light beers but if i had to choose a light beer this would be the choice for now. perfectly refreshing for outdoors and camping. recommended for those seeking a mass produced light beer other than the big three american labels.
3119,Amstel Light,1,drain-pour!
3120,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,3.04,(24 oz can; 24 053; purchased cold from a casey store in the dakotas this week... decanted into a busch shaker pint)  yellow-amber liquid very mild haze; luxuriously silky wavy head; this actually looks fantastic! lace city... smells like industrially artificial sugar cookie with a sweet creamed corn character; maybe a slight sickly corn likker booziness accenting; overall very potent in your face... on the palate: moonshine and malt syrup - yuck! - i cant even imagine any resemblance to a cheap tripel... luckily its relatively dry almost weightless on the palate with only the slighest residual film and warmth... as unique as this is its far from well brewed though it has potential; i do suspect this was a lower abv malt liquor cut with grain alcohol or moonshine; somethings quite off about it; beware of this! - only drink this ice cold from the can (2175)
3121,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.42,poured from a can. straw in color with a white head. smells of corn malt and a sweet hint. flavors of grain malt and a boozy bitter background. not what i would call a great taste but its not the worst. worth the try for the dollar i spent.
3122,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.79,24oz can date code indecipherable. poured into an arcoroc nonic pint glass.  a - poured a clear golden color with a quickly receding head that left no lacing on the glass.  s - smells of malts adjuncts and green apples. abv is not hidden well in the nose.  t - initial tart green apple and corn notes fade to leave a boozy bitterness at the back of the throat. overall harsh flavor despite the word smooth being printed almost ten times on the can.  m - light-bodied with medium carbonation. feels somewhat slick as it moves around the mouth.  o - among others within the style even other hgls this one is far from pleasant. tick completed.
3123,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.4,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. the head fades very fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma of the brew is heavy of a corn syrup sweetness mixed with aromas of a dusty dankness as well as a metallic smell. with a touch of cardboard the aroma is overall not the most enticing. taste – the taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste mixed with a touch of grain and a decently strong paper taste. as the taste advances some light mustiness and more paper as well as some metallic tastes comes to the tongue leaving one with a metallic and sweet malt liquor taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. for the style and the more off tastes the feel is good as it minimizes the impact of the flavors on the tongue to its greatest extent. overall – not the best malt out there for sure…
3124,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,4.94,you pussies this is a mans beer
3125,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.73,24 oz. can:  pours yellow. fast carbonation kills the head to bubbles and a ring. no real lacing sticks.  the smell is of alcohol some grain. alcohol dominates but overall not too offensive.  the taste makes my face involuntarily twinges at the taste. this is bad - even for the style. raw alcohol with an odd sweetness that is tough to describe.  this is harsh - it says smooth but don\t believe it.  this is for people who want a quick buzz at a cheap price. i somehow made it through the whole can but never again. there are better malt liquors out there. this is one of the worst beers ive ever had. i dont recommend it even to alcoholics looking for a cheap high abv brew.
3126,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.25,you know with so many good beers available i keep trying these high gravity lagers just for completions sake. and thats kind of sad. sure if you want 24 ounces of 12% try this or one of the many other high gravity lagers available. or get something quality with less alcohol and have two. same result better taste. oh well it could have been truly nasty tasting. ca. 2010
3127,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,3.03,24oz can poured into 12oz tulip. poured a clean clear dark yellow color with about 1/2 inch of white head that dissipated very quickly and left no lacing.  the aroma was neutral leaning towards bland.  the flavor was also bland except for a bit of alcohol sharpness.  the body was light and even with a definite alcohol burn at the finish.  drinkability was ok although i would have preferred a smaller format. overall it is what it is; a cheap buzz. $1.99 for 24oz of 9.9% beer. you could do worse if you need to scratch this style itch.
3128,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.36,type: 24-oz. can glass: clear 15.25-oz. pilsner from: 5 star market & liquor in la mesa calif.. price: $1.79 purchased: oct. 31 2017 consumed: oct. 31 2017 reviewed as: american malt liquor misc.: no canned on date; can reads 9.9 pct. abv  recently was dared to review a king cobra. actually did not know that malt liquor was reviewable on beer advocate. once i looked it up and saw i was had to go with it. once i saw that there were seven (seven!) (edit: now eight (eight!)) other malt liquors at the next-door market made it a point to review one each tuesday until i run out. typically am against all the big boy beers but i am breaking that rule for this challenge. eighth up was stack (high gravity). apparently it was brewed by united brands in lacrosse wis. and under special agreement in memphis tenn. can read “stack 101 high gravity smooth lager is brewed with the finest extra malted barley and select hops for a bold yet exceptionally smooth taste. stack 101 smooth lager is the first introductory brew style by stack brewing company. stack beer is brewed with superior ingredients for big bold and smooth flavor.” a quick look at beer advocate and it had it at 2.13. whoa. that meant it was only better than king cobra and old english 800. going in i had it e40 mickey’s hurricane steele reserve 211 natty daddy old english 800 and king cobra with the latter three pretty far back.  poured a straw clear color with two fingers of off-white fizzy head. lots of fast moving bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. decent spotty lacing. average retention. (sight - 3.25)  smelled kind of a mess initially like a bunch of flavors trying to get out of the can. got red apple sweet corn syrup scrambled eggs skunk light strawberry pear and buttered sourdough bread. not smelling too boozy. (smell - 2.75)  usually the first taste of american malt liquors for me are not terrible but the second one can be all over the place (usually much much worse). however this may have been the worst first taste of the lot. second taste was even worse but not as bad as it could have been. specifically got sweet corn syrup buttered white bread spoiled pear green apple white grape hints of strawberry boxed white wine barley wet grain scrambled eggs and wet skunky fart. did not taste 9.9 pct. (taste - 2.25)  medium body. thin texture. average carbonation. abrupt finish. very unbalanced and tough to swallow. (feel - 1.50)  was kind of all over the place on a few categories here. certainly wasn’t a fan. would have it in the lower 1/3 of the malt liquors. (overall - 2.25)  2.36 | 57 | d+
3129,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.89,this beer was listed as 9.9% not 12%. good looking pour for the style. smell is pretty boozy taste is very close to a barleywine but on the low end of the scale. no bad flavors but the booziness is a bit hard to take. mouthfeel is medium to full with a lightly bitter finish. overall not my type of beer but not bad for the style.
3130,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.42,ubc lacrosse wi and under special agreement memphis tn on the can.  it pours a fairly dark yellow with a 1 finger head of foam with lots of bubble action.  huge corn notes in the smell as well as some grain. it also smells the full 9.9% abv.  corn first and foremost followed by some lemon twang that leans towards the tart side. saying that it is rough tasting would almost be a compliment; smooth is mentioned a few times on the can.  the tartness intensifies as the beer warms and in a case like this that is not a good thing.  i had to try it. it was cheap as dirt. i hope my sink doesnt mind a few ounces.
3131,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.05,its cheap its 9.9% and its horrible i like high gravity malt liquors but this is just bad  it was $1.65 but dont let that price point fool you you can get much better for the same price.  its just so strong and full of corn like drinking bio diesel its not super carbonated but it is bubbly its reminds me of sunny delight  its so fake and full of artificial crap strong and syrupy .  this is so bad its so strong  i couldnt just drink it like a normal beer  i had to sip it like a wine  it took me a while to finish it.  i used to get 4 16 once for $1.99 at the center market and i used to be able to pound them like nothing and that was when it was 12% . and after i had to drink this slowly because it was so bad i barly got a buzz . might as well of got a can of pbr...  this stuff is not good  i bought it to see if it was as bad as i remember and the can for the collection.  if you dont want to do either of this stay away  get old englishe hurricane steel reserve ice house edge or even natty daddy  anything is better than this even 4loco or other alco pop you can drown out the nasty with 7 up  i do not recommend stay away
3132,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.97,i picked up a 24oz can at my local corner mart. looks like a real winner. abv is 9.9% per the label. stack high gravity smooth lager. reviewed as a malt liquor given its marketing price point and ingredients list. served into a pilsner glass in austin texas. reviewed live. expectations are extremely low.  served cold - straight from the fridge. side-poured gently as overcarbonation is anticipated.  a: no bubble show forms as its poured.  pours a predictable clear translucent yellow littered with abundant carbonation bubbles. its got some nice vibrance and isnt weak looking like many malt liquors. no floating yeast particles/sediment is visible; its quite clean. high transparency; you can read text through this beer.  the head is initially two fingers wide but recedes to a very thin layer atop the body inside one minute. still the retention is better than youd expect for a budget range malt liquor at this high an abv. some limited spotty inconsistent lacing does cling to the sides of the glass after the head recedes.  overall its an above average appearance for a malt liquor. i cant say im looking forward to trying it but there arent any egregious flaws.  sm: has a heavy malty and adjuncty sweetness. loads of corn - mainly adjunct. malt syrups/extract. not as grainy as would be ideal. i also get some faint berry character - strawberry i think. its strange and artificial but lends some needed complexity to an otherwise boring aroma. to its credit there are no traces of the 9.9% abv in the aroma. i also dont find any yeast character - or any really hop character - not even just a simple floral profile. the syrupy sweetness is off-putting and im anticipating a sickly buttery texture but this is far from the foulest malt liquor aroma ive come across.  average strength.  t: the syrupy sweetness is certainly the core of the beer but it isnt as offensive as anticipated. its got some light graininess and could use more. heavy corn adjunct is present alongside the aforementioned artificial strawberry note - which isnt doing the flavour profile any favors. i also get a cheap white wine character and some disgusting green apple notes. theres no real hop profile here.  to be fair i will say that it hides its alcohol content pretty decently. but i cant say i like it; theres no complexity or subtlety here whatsoever. its far from an intricate or gestalt build. unbalanced as well.  mf: buttery smooth wet and sticky. overcarbonated as hell. presence on the palate is abysmal; its making me a bit ill. has a bit too much weight body and thickness for how little flavour there is; its very filling. the texture doesnt seem well designed for this flavour profile. execution is quite poor overall but again i do think its worth mentioning that its not a hot or boozy brew which is something of an accomplishment. that said its a pretty harsh mouthfeel overall.  not astringent or gushed.  dr: not the worst malt liquor on the market but far from the best. its almost sickening but i cant give it a lower rating than this because it isnt watery and still tastes like beer. ill be making a concerted effort to finish the entire can. its not a sipper but its low quality makes it tough to quaff and consuming it is making me feel terrible (especially in my stomach). abv is hidden better than youd expect. i wouldnt recommend this beer to anybody. even just in this style and price range there are better beers (and more widely available ones for that matter). stick to steel reserve for those nights when classy just doesnt cut it.  reasonably atrocious.  d-
3133,Haze,4.91,look - hazy thick juicy nice foamy white head scattered lacing left behind smell - peach orange tropical citrus taste - peach citrus pith pineapple feel - medium body well carbonated citrus pith bitterness overall - tree house haze all in my brain lately things just dont seem the same. the citrus pith bitterness is strong in this one which i love. strong citrusy scent right off the bat too. tropical juiciness peach and pineapple tantalize the taste buds. hoppy finish lingers. this brew is excellent and even better when paired with purple haze by jimi hendrix. acting funny but i dont know why excuse me while i kiss the sky. cheers!
3134,Haze,4.48,16oz can into a pint glass. canned 4/21 so 3 weeks old  thick pale orange juice body with a persistent white head leaving rings of lacing. muted aroma of tropical fruit which becomes massive in the taste. medium hop bite for balance thick mouthfeel outstanding beer.
3135,Haze,3.24,ths are in top tier while this one is good i felt the 8%+ abv almost tasted of a dipa which is too much for my taste us but still good and wouldnt turn down.
3136,Abraxas,3.94,pours an opaque pitch-black coloration with a small fizzy head. smells of roasted caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas with hints of vanilla coming through as well. taste follows the nose with a poor balance of roasted caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes with the cinnamon standing out particularly as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis. finishes bittersweet with a medium sweetness light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.  ba abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that i have ever tasted and perhaps unsurprisingly the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that i already disliked for the barrel-aged version. its basically a total cinnamon bomb the cinnamon being way too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. theres hints of vanilla as well but next to no chili heat coming through which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. at least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet but i have had plenty of much better mexican imperial stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. i will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here rich and velvety while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. also the abv is very well-hidden this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. this is by no means a bad beer just feels more like a pastry stout than a mexican stout to me.
3137,Abraxas,4.53,2022 vintage. cacao and a hint of chili on the nose. taking a first sip the cacao really pops. a light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. the chili isnt spicy but its flavorful.  this is a fantastic imperial stout. at first i thought this might be a little too sweet but as i drink more its really not. the sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the bakers chocolate as well as the cinnamon and i can see why they did it. i might have dialed it back just a hair but thats a nitpick.  full bodied. nice and thick like an imperial stout should be. almost chewy. as the beer gets warmer the cinnamon gets more noticeable.  long after a sip vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. wonderful.  overall this is one of the very best imperial stouts ive had. excellent job. i will buy a few more of these and see how they age assuming i can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first.
3138,Abraxas,4.54,truly an excellent beer!  bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past march. i decided to have it for father’s day!  poured into a tulip glass. rich oily dark brown color with a brown head and excellent curtain lacing. needed to let it warm for the nose to open a bit. smell of dark chocolate cinnamon vanilla and chili pepper. follows to the taste. initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. this transitioned to stronger chocolate cinnamon vanilla. the chili also becomes stronger as it warms. apricot and cream seriously. pleasant booze and malt background. flavors are so nicely woven together. luxuriant smooth feel. i would love to try the barrel aged version sometime. a great father’s day treat!
3139,Abraxas,4.45,deep copper with a 1/2 tan head which slowly fades. minimal lacing.  aroma of cinnamon chocolate hot pepper vanilla caramelly as it warms.  taste is cinnamon peppers chocolate roasty vanilla stronger on the nose than palate.  full body light carbonation. thick & oily finish.  bottled 10/23/17. as expected with a 5 year old high abv stout it has little head & minimal lacing. apart from that this is a very good imp stout.
3140,Abraxas,4.5,2021 11.5 abv
3141,Abraxas,4.66,l: poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter - heavy black pour with very little dark foam risen to the surface. s: notes of chocolate coffee dark fruits vanilla cinnamon. very on point with the description and it’s awesome because you can smell the chili in there as well. t: wow. definitely getting the bakers/ milk chocolate upfront along with some vanilla cinnamon dark fruits chili peppers and malts. this is so good! f: thick syrupy heavy bodied easy to drink. the abv hides very well in this. o: i knew once i read chili it would be a hit or miss because sometimes with other beers you can’t taste it as much but this hits it on point. great job!
3142,Abraxas,4.84,2021 vintage:  poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter.  look- black opaque no visible particulate dark brown frothy head slightly below average lacing average head retention.  smell- cacao vanilla chili pepper slight ceylon cinnamon medium strength of scent.  taste- cacao vanilla chili pepper ceylon cinnamon moderately sweet mildly spicy high strength of flavor.  feel- medium body highly silky slightly below average carbonation highly mouth warming moderately mouth coating moderately sweet mildly spicy.  overall- black and opaque with average head retention. bouquet was a fantastic mix of cacao vanilla chili pepper and ceylon cinnamon with medium strength. taste was a high strength blend of cacao vanilla chili pepper and ceylon cinnamon that was truly delightful. this beer had medium body with high silkiness and mouth warming properties. overall this beer provided a fantastic experience and is one of the best stouts i have ever had!
3143,Abraxas,3.66,2022 vintage  contains: lactose   way too sweet and unbalanced with some off flavors.
3144,Abraxas,4.5,poured into a tulip. very modest head. zero lacing. very dark brown but not quite black. essentially opaque. not as viscous as some of the style.  very pleasant and melded aromas. chocolate coffee cinnamon vanilla and cashew.  roasty but sweet malts on the tip of the tongue. coffee and nutty/vanilla notes in midstream. bitterness boosts here to the end. the cinnamon gives way to the ancho warmth at the finish. hides the booze well.  medium-full bodied but not quite chewy. modest carbonation but not sticky or cloying.  this brew and bomb! are sixes and sevens for me and thats a high compliment. this is a more restrained take with a bit less sweetness and heat and more nutty goodness.
3145,Bud Light Platinum,3,bottle share at temperance street with a bit of a mad one pours an ultra pale golden ale looking body with splatterings of white head aroma is bready malts and yeast flavour is
3146,Bud Light Platinum,3.2,handwritten notes from 10+ years ago.  appearance - clear straw body. very clear and pale. very active carbonation in the head. sounds like a soda more than a beer. head lasts for a minute then disappears completely. no lace. 3  smell - alcohol and musky corn. a little thick and gummy. very much like a malt liquor. 3  taste - stale and musky. tastes much better straight from the bottle for some reason. pretty clean. some faint artificial sweetness like splenda. almost flavorless. a more alcoholic michelob ultra. 3.5  mouthfeel - slight crispness. leaves faint stick on tongue but very clean. 3  overall - the ultimate frat beer. 3
3147,Bud Light Platinum,1.4,clearly below average for an adjunct. smooth alcoholic slightly sour. only drank because it was free. id much rather drink a corona or even a busch light over this. please dont drink this; much better adjuncts exist. if you want the alcohol without other redeeming qualities then go right ahead.
3148,Bud Light Platinum,4.22,i think there are far too many opinions due to this beer being the american beer category but i completely disagree with most of them. it doesn’t taste or smell disgusting like many reviewers say in fact i truly believe that most of the negative reviews are beer drinkers that typically don’t drink light beers or what they call “adjuncts” but i think this is a fairly decent tasting beer!
3149,Bud Light Platinum,2.95,light beers need a different scale. the whole point is hopefully getting the best taste possible along with low cals/carbs. if you can somehow sneak some extra abv in there all the better. so this one ticks all of those boxes and this coming from someone who cant stand bud light. the taste here is the typical a-b soapy water but it isnt offensive especially cold out of a bottle. no aftertaste which is good for this style. also low on gassiness.  yeah of course its far from a quality sipping beer but in terms of the reasons why light beers exist it nails them. if youre familiar with another 130 cal 5 carb 6.0% abv beer let me know! all the light/session ipas of recent years tend to be about 4.0% abv and taste like overly fizzy junk anyway.
3150,Bud Light Platinum,2.3,it looks ok smells ok but tastes of watery corn syrup. i used to be ok with it when it was ice ice cold thirsty and wanted some abv. now i only have one because its beer 130 calories and 6 abv. all in all a great concept but this barely hits it in that delivery. in lieu of an ultra it works. as to beer to drink for the taste of a good beer skip it.
3151,Bud Light Platinum,1.75,dont care how you dress bud light up it still taste like crap!!! there are sooo many better beers than a anheuser-busch product.
3152,Ten FIDY,4.41,a black body covered with a two-finger brown head assimilates into a pint glass. the head is quite active and fades in a few minutes but leaves ample lacing... the carbonation level is good. the smell is absurdly light for a 10.5 abv imperial stout. mostly malt and grain with a subtle sweetness on the back end. the flavor however is superb. coffee and chocolate notes malt grains nuttiness subdued hops for the style... this beer is finely crafted and literally wafts across the tongue like waves on the beach especially as it warms during the session. the high abv stout category has been somewhat overrun by a faddish movement toward barrel aged brews and many of them are great beers... but oscar blues ten fidy is a great example of how good a finely designed imperial stout can be in the hands of a great brewer. i love this beer!
3153,Ten FIDY,1,gave this beer a try on a whim and i must say that i was beyond disappointed in this brew. the whole thing tasted and smelled of rubbing alcohol flavored stout. a shame really; i enjoy oskar blues and this was just a tremendous letdown. not even worth finishing the can off.
3154,Ten FIDY,4.32,first sniff is chocolate first taste is hops. i\m surprised i didn\t rate this the first time i tried it. this is a solid surprisingly not-sweet what an ipa would like to be option.
3155,Ten FIDY,4.59,poured black really black. with a brown head that stood tall. the aroma while not as strong as it would be for most as my nose has been affected by covid is still coffee and roasted malts. the taste is an amazing balance of flavors; the roasted malts bring the coffee and cacao and dark fruits and the hops provide an edge that keeps the flavor in check. the feel is almost chewy and it seems right for all the flavors that are present. this is one of my favorite “pure” imperial stouts just so good.
3156,Ten FIDY,4.48,purchased as part of a 4 pack of 12 oz cans.  l- pitch black with a moderate creamy head.  s- almost sweet roasted cocoa aroma.  t- sweet dark chocolate upfront slight hop bite followed by a dark roasted coffee and chocolate finish.  f- moderate mouthfeel. smooth with a slight tannic bite.  o- an absolutely beautiful imperial stout!
3157,Ten FIDY,4.38,pours black as night. dark foam. sweet malt aroma. heavy roasted chocolate malt body. coffee and caramel finish. sweet but not overly sweet. smoother than expected but you can definitely taste the alcohol. not for the amateur beer drinker.
3158,Ten FIDY,4.33,pours a jet black that forms a moderate caramel head. dissipates at a slower pace and leaves a good amount of soapy lacing and a nice level of retention on the top. aromas of licorice cherries roasted malt chocolate and coffee. taste is heavy on the roasted malts bitter chocolate coffee and earthy hops. becomes sweeter towards the aftertaste with a boozy finish. medium-bodied. a very good imperial stout that is worth a re-visit.
3159,Ten FIDY,4.09,l: 4.75. opaque black body. dark tan head. s: 3.75. dark fruits and a hint of mocha t: 4. upgrade from the nose. dark chocolate. caramel. roasted malt and west coast hops. f: 4.5 thick mouthfeel but smooth. o: 4.25. great american imperial stout.
3160,Ten FIDY,4.4,purchased at pennridge beverage. perkasie. pa. $16/4pk. 12oz cans  pours a pitch black abyss black. a dense but quicky fading beige head on the initial pour. leaves sticky lacing on the glass after each sip.  aromas of roasty malts and chocolate. very inviting.  a delicous imperial stout. great tastes of chocolate deep roasted malts and a definite boozy aftertaste. very drinkable even at a 10.5% abv.  very smooth consistency with low to moderate carbonation. leaves a nice coating in your mouth after each sip.  overall a top-notch stout. highly recommended...cheers!
3161,Ten FIDY,4.04,poured from a 12 oz can dated 10/12/2022 into a snifter glass. l - pours a dark brown color with a nice tan head that dissipates slowly. s - smells of chocolate and coffee. t - taste follows the smell lots of bitter coffee and bakers chocolate with some booziness on the finish. f - medium to full bodied and lightly carbonated. o - tasty boozy stout.
3162,Ten FIDY,4.02,pours black with a fluffy sculpted three finger head that lasts and coats the glass with foam. aroma is roasted black malt. there is a resemblance of coffee as well. taste is roasted malt with a touch of sweetness as if it were similar to a milk stout. however the black malt is the over-arching profile here. along with it comes a feeling of bubbles on the tongue at the end of the profile.
3163,Ten FIDY,4.18,12 oz can canned on date: 26 nov 2018 consumed on: 25 dec 2022 glass: tulip snifter abv: 10.5% serving temp: room temp   look: black with a 2-finger high brown head. the head dissipates to a thick ring and cover. lacing is very good.  smell: deep and dark roasted malts. bittersweet chocolate and some faint coffee. light licorice/anise and a hint of molasses. earthy and somewhat spicy hops.  taste: an earthy hop bitterness starts things off but is quickly met and balanced by the substantial roasted dark malt notes. coffee and chocolate (first bittersweet but quickly changing to semisweet) are noticeable. a mild sweetness appears that is a combo of semisweet chocolate molasses and faint dark fruits. a quick hit of earth comes back and lingers in through the finish. the sip finishes a shade dry.  feel: creamy velvety and viscous. there is a nice warmth from the alcohol. the body is between medium and medium-full (though closer to medium)  overall: a very nice imperial stout that makes a great winter warmer and fireplace sipper. nice balance and even complexity.  the 4 years of age have had a wonderful effect on this brew. if i recall it when fresh (it has been a couple of years) it was quite bitter and even one note (maybe two notes). now it is superb. i wonder how it would be at 5 years?  i also wonder if the ibus have been reduced in more recent versions. i recall either 75 or 95 ibus for ten-fidy and as i mentioned the brew seemed very bitter to me when fresh a few years ago. ob currently lists the ibus as 65.
3164,Ten FIDY,4.25,2022 version - 12 oz can into a snifter at 50°. big tight brown head forms over the dense dark elixir. smell is stone fruit cacao anise coffee dark roast malt. taste is the same as the nose but somehow it seems the flavor profile changed from previous cannings. it’s lacking ‘ fullness’ and anticipated bitterness. feel for this batch is less oily and thinner uptight carbonation. overall an american stout classic that’s always a treat.
3165,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,3.64,12oz bottle date notched feb thanks to my brother-in-law chris for picking up a mixed 12 pack to try l: brown body slight amber hues; thin beige head disappears quickly s: malty and grainy caramel toffee bread crust noble hops t: caramelized grain toffee bread crust mild roast earthy & spicy noble hops f: light-to-medium body moderate carbonation balanced and dry finish o: it’s been a long time since i’ve had a sam adams anything; this was good
3166,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,4.39,awsome new addition to the adams family. not some stoopid ippa dippa trippa or neippa. just a good ol down to earth marzden coming at the perfect time of the year!  boston beer is always innovating their line-up.  sadly this flannel fest only comes in a sample pack.  i only wish it was available on draft!!
3167,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,3.71,clear deep amber with one finger of quickly-dissipating tan head.  smell is toffee a bit of molasses and brown bread.  taste is similar to aroma but of higher intensity and with a bit of sourdough tang. light bitterness that is most apparent mid-taste.  feel is medium with moderate  sharp carbonation. slight dryness at finish and beyond.  overall though nothing wow  pleasant & easy-drinking. more than one could easily happen. :)
3168,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,3.94,12 oz. bottle enjoy by feb 2024. munich dunkel. cozy & smooth. product of the usa.  a: pours a caramel - copper / rubyish color. small finger of mocha froth that hangs out looking rather espresso like.. not too much lacing but it appears well carbonated. looks good per the style. s: aroma is warm nutty toasty brown-bready.. it reminds me of fall / autumn / winter and i guess ive kind of missed that smell. cozy is right. there is a bit of underlying herbal hoppiness to be found.. t: taste follows: warm nutty brown & bready. toasty with some fruity sort of sweetness for balance. only slight presence of earthy hops but its a good balance for sure. f: smooth crisp clean. easy-drinking medium-light bodied good prickly carbonation. its easy-drinking stuff at only 5.2% also.  overall actually rather enjoyed this one. recommended.  samuel adams flannel fest -----4/5.
3169,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,4,incredibly solid offering from sa.  if they were smart they would make this a separate fall seasonal.....i would for sure purchase it.. not the best dunkel ever or anything but there are lots of folks who dont have access to one on a regular basis...  dark...roasted... malty..  hits all the right notes for the style. i enjoyed it and will gladly drink the other 2 in the sampler
3170,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,3.84,pours a clear dark brown with a reddish tint. thin tan head that sticks around and leaves some nice lacing. aroma is roasted malt dark bread and a hint of caramel. flavor follows the nose a bit sweet. feel is on the light side of medium bodied well carbonated. overall a nice beer.
3171,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,3.73,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours dark amber brown color with a one finger head of puffy tan foam. the head has a fantastic level of retention very slowly fading over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma of the brew is strong of a roasted and toasted bready smell mixed with lots of caramel toffee and molasses. along with these smells comes notes of maple syrup and a touch of char and spice. taste – the taste begins with a sweet brown sugar and maple syrup flavor mixed with some lightly toasted bready flavors. at the same time there are notes of molasses and toffee as were depicted in the nose. as the taste advances some lightly bitter coffee and a hint of char come to the tongue along with a touch of smoke. the sweetness initially dwindles from the start only to surge at the end leaving one with a rich and sweet roasty taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is thick for a 5.2 % abv brew with a carbonation level that is on the moderate side. for the maple and brown sugar tastes the feel is nice creating a coating feeling to accentuate the rich tastes. overall – a rather sweet and moderately roasty dunkel. rather good for a cool fall day.
3172,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,3.77,12oz bottle best before notched jan poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 5.2% abv 20 ibu. the beer pours bright darker amber with chestnut highlights and khaki colored head. the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. the aroma is mild with a singular note of nutty well toasted malt. the taste is semisweet toasted malt with a hint of roasted malt. nutty earthy notes and cacao appear before a mild finishing bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. cleanly lagered. overall very good.
3173,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,3.93,appearance: pours a clear tawny-brown body with an inch or so of ivory-hued foam.  smell: crumbly toasted bread crusts with a clear scent of chocolate but also a hint of discarded nut shells  taste: toasty breadcrusts with a crisp magic chocolate shell and dissipating caramel accent. medium degree of sweetness. lightly earthy herbal hops with a little bit of balancing bitterness. drying finish.  mouthfeel: medium-light body. medium carbonation.  overall: its comforting to know bbc can take a little break from cranking out gut-churning seltzers and sugary ciders to make a simple sufficient beer.
3174,Samuel Adams Flannel Fest,4.28,clear reddish-copper color very clear; dense carbonation; thin yet lasting head bone-white. rich malt nose; toasted and roasted grain; toffee and deep caramel. the taste mirrors the aroma; very little if any hop bitterness; some roasted nut undertones complementing the toasted / roasted grain flavor. rich full mouthfeel; outstanding residual sugar density slightly sticky; very mild coarseness on the palate; finishes with a mild overall dryness.  it has been a long time since i last had a boston beer co. beer let alone a memorable one. this dunkel is rich and flavorful exuding a robust character.  pouring temperature: 39 °f; bottling info: enjoy before jan source: local purchase (single)

3177,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.62,sweet with subtle fruity flavor. dangerously smooth and easy to drink.
3178,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.33,750ml bottle - pours a deep ruby brown with off-white foam head that dissipates slowly. smells of sweet dark & dried fruit. tastes very sweet with strong notes of dried fruit with a touch of banana and spice. a little surypy in texture and finish. great little gem of a quad.
3179,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.25,first sniff is banana first sip is raisin. no hint of the abv until a few sips in. it decided to foam at opening but not disastrously. very pretty in the glass very smooth going down. this could be a dangerous i\m thirsty beer....
3180,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.19,served in a clear pint glass filled with almost no off-white head from a tap it came. its brightly copper-amber and just slightly cloudy. it provides that belgian smell of yeast and malt with a little hops added. its banana-like sweet and unfortunately a bit of banana-like stickiness comes with it. but not so much more than others within the style even the great ones. to its credit there is also much more than the banana hit. the notes described almond and vanilla presence and vanilla is a definite. theres also some cinnamon or maybe clove reference that with the abv provides a nice bite. overall this drinks mostly sweet and spicy. the aforementioned stickiness is much better than it being too thin. theres no glass lacing and little alcohol hit which is only an asset to the overall taste. this hits all the right notes for a belgian quad so those that love them will love this one.
3181,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.18,750 ml bottle into a chalice. secret code l19a21 had 8/21/21.  pours a medium reddish amber a little cloudy with a one and a half inch foamy head with very good retention and a decent amount of foamy lacing. aromas of caramel malt banana spices grapes candi sugar a bit of a sweet aroma as it warms. mostly similar flavors- caramel malt spices grapes candi sugar some plums a light earthy hop bitterness midway through the finish. smooth semi- dry a very good medium body well carbonated.  this is lighter than typical for the style but matches up well to any quad. the grapes and caramel are the most prominent. very enjoyable.
3182,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),3.57,pours a clear hazelnut brown color with a subtle eggshell colored head.  smells of sugared boozy raisins spicy molasses and a note of milk chocolate.  has a well carbonated mineralic mouthfeel which despite the beer’s elevated abv gives it a pleasant refreshment.  tastes of rustic bakers chocolate earthy cinnamon and sweet licorice together with a stony carbonation burst. offers a nut forward middle part together with caramel and a whiff of honey. finishes with a noble spicy dryness among rock sugar and cakey malts.  solid with a pleasing depth together with a profound malt backbone establishing a well working balance.
3183,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.85,love this beer. one of my favorite belgian imports. pricy but not as bad as the deleriums or chimays.
3184,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),3.94,750ml bottle into a goblet. coding hard to understand but may have been bottled this year.  splendid looking beer. dark reddish brown body. big creamy off white head persists in good form throughout impressive given the abv leaving a lot of interesting lacing.  nice banana on the aroma. there is also something slightly floral which is not as pleasant.  on tasting malty banana smooth quite strong but not overly boozy. not getting and dark fruit though.  mouth full finish warm slightly sweet banana.  overall not bad. not quite as good as i expected but an enjoyable drink on a snowy pennsylvania night.
3185,Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,2.24,medium orange hue; very see-through. obviously filtered.  noticeable bitterness & hop aroma in the nose.  nice white head good lacing throughout.  as for the taste...where did the hops go?! theyre in the nose but vanish on the tongue. tastes very much like a lager to me. this has 3 months left on its best before date so cant blame it on age.  watery with no discernable flavor. a touch of bitterness on the back end but hardly noticeable. after an interesting nose this macro falls way flat.
3186,King Sue,4.71,explosive grapefruit nose after popping the top. orange-yellow hazy pour with a loose bubbly head. really nice evolution of flavors from opening with orange then tropical fruit followed by a nice grapefruit t-rex bite for the finish. cant wait to get bitten again.
3187,King Sue,4.5,good a little spicy a little grapefruit. would do again.
3188,King Sue,4.4,picked up a four-pack from the appalachian vintner 6-21-23 for $18.49. canned 5-26-23; consumed can #1& 2 6-22-23.  beer poured a hazy light golden orange with an okay white head.  nose is very nice citrus and tropical fruit forward.  taste is a light but substantive pale malt base that allows the hops to shine thru and that they do. very flavorful with orange papaya and mango shining through. finishes with a touch of grapefruit and some major pith; 7/10 on my bitterness scale.  mouthfeel is ultra-light and very refreshing.  overall yep king sue lives up to its reputation!
3189,Pacifico Light,2.74,12oz bottle review from notes  on my journey through the depths of mexican lager i came across this light beer my review is simply that i am glad it has 4.5% abv bc it is worthless otherwise  refreshing and can possibly get you drunk
3190,Pacifico Light,1.95,very watered down even more than youd expect for a light beer. i like the clara a lot more than a traditional mexican lager but unfortunately the light one has much less flavor than clara or even other light beers! not bad on the beach but id take a corona or others over this.
3191,State Light American Lager,3,so sad nt are awesome craft but this one was mafe foftje mainstream and certaily tastes like it. in a blind taste test i would of guess this was a product of a mass brewer.
3192,State Light American Lager,3.43,poured from a 16 oz. can. has a yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of grains. taste is mild grains malts highly refreshing. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent example of a light beer.
3193,State Light American Lager,4.13,16 oz. can. nice hop presence which somewhat masks the low-cal flavor. yellow body with a fluffy white head which was slow to dissipate. one of the better light lagers ive had.
3194,State Light American Lager,3.02,purchased at nastase beverage in bellfonte.  look: pours extremely clear bright and a very faint pale straw yellow with and all white head that quickly settles with some minimal side glass lace. looks like the pour of a mich ultra. and not inviting at all. aroma: its all in the form of grass grain corn husk. a light beer with 4.2% abv with few interesting characterisitcs. taste: same as aroma and look. has all the trademarks of an economy macro brew from the last century unfortunately no economy at $$34.99 case price. new trail just throwing something out there for psu tailgating.
3195,State Light American Lager,2.96,excellent light american lager. i managed to find a six pack of pint cans for $8.99 which is only a dollar more than miller light in my area. sweet and simple quite refreshing. these would probably be the perfect companion to brats and a ballgame.
3196,Nectarine Premiere,4.41,poured from a 750ml bottle into an oversized wine glass  look: a hazy orange with a very thin white head that dissipates quickly.  smell: sweet and fresh nectarine hits the nose immediately. this fades into a buttery oak with some hay like funk. a little salty and mildly acidic.  taste: nectarine juice shocks the palate that fades to a buttery oak. this is punched aside by a lightly briny sour note that fades to more nectarine stone fruit notes on the finish.  feel: bright clean mildly acidic. no alcohol noted. light carbonation.  overall: a beautiful and clean sour. the brewery really knows what they are doing!
3197,Nectarine Premiere,4.39,6/2019 batch! sweet and tart fruity-yeasty funky a hint of oak-barrel and a nice and sweet nectarine stonefruity nose on this one! nice aromatics! taste follows with a well-balanced slightly briny oak and under-ripe tart nectarine finish. the oak barrel is pretty well integrated at this point...i was just hoping for a little more jammy-sweet nectarine on the palate. delicious!
3198,Nectarine Premiere,3.76,10/21
3199,Nectarine Premiere,4.51,bottled september 2020  alright folks here we are the final bif beer i received from @eziel! it’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. this is currently the 5th highest rated saison on ba and 52nd overall. those are some impressive stats. also i’m not sure if i’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine it’s usually a blend. let’s get into it  pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing  sheesh less than stellar appearance aside this is bold in the nose just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. im picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine wet hay tart apricot sharp oak lemon yogurt wildflower honey straw and crackery malt  oh man the funk is even punchier in taste but not in a way thats out of balance. on the front end of the sip im tasting tart peach lemon juice white wine vinegar stone sharp oak nectarine wet hay honey and lemongrass. the swallow brings notes of wet hay stone white wine vinegar peach pit nectarine sharp oak crackery malt lemon yogurt and light orange juice  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk  wow this is one hell of a beer! its highly complex yet i could chug it. but why would i do that? i plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night
3200,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.21,2019 bottle drank 7/31/23  pours dark black zero carbonation. strong pleasant aroma of chocolate and molasses. taste is much of the same with an added hint of coffee and bourbon barrel. feel is thin and flat which really distracts from this being a top ba stout for me. overall it’s ok taste wise but maybe 4 years old was way to long to wait on this one
3201,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.4,lift bridge silhouette barrel aged imperial stout. 2014. bottle number 239. 750 ml. 1 pint 9.4 fluid ounces. alc. 10% by volume. aged in bourbon barrels. brewed and bottled by lift bridge brewing company in stillwater mn usa. the cold war is over. serve at 55-60. degrees. (i still don\t know the key for that one.) i will skip the the gobbledygook until later.  (note: this is one of those very rare occasions when i dont have a photo of the beer i consumed to go along with the notes. i plugged in the ipod touch that use to take them and found nothing. how is this possible? its part of my regular routine i never forget to take the pictures. could i have accidentally deleted them somehow? thats even less likely. perhaps i was just so excited to drink the beer that i forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. so once i realized there were no photos i fished the empty bottle out of the recycling and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass i drank it from. thats not even the true beer in there i followed silhouette with another bottle.   i bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. wish i had another to save and age and savor in the future but this is the one and im drinking it now. (id actually never even heard of this beer must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)   solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer ive had from this brewery) with a rich roast tan head that starts big slims down and stays awhile.  aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. additional notes of charcoal molasses caramel toffee dark fruit …vanilla. always vanilla. and i like it.  taste: ah mmm and yeah huh. deepness and richness in abundance. this has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. immensely indulgent. chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. mmm ill say it again. and what else? licorice. we call it anise sometimes. and all those other things.  its a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. i am loving this and this is not a chore at all it is a delight. if you want to read about a chore check my review of stones crime and punishment. yikes talk about trial and error!  hey let\s read the gobbledygook. silhouette is as deep and dark as the northern woods. it\s brewed in the style of an imperial stout. aromas of coffee chocolate molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . the beer is complex rich and full bodied. it\s wild spirit will warm the senses illuminate the soul and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season.
3202,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.45,2020 bottling 12 oz bottle.  i walked on by this beer many times in the store because i considered it to be overpriced (yeah i know... it\s a 99 world-class here but we\re suckers for a ba imperial stout...).  anyhow in a weak moment i did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back and it sat in my fridge and sat until i finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers.  its back in the refrigerator for cellaruary.  so today is the day. i wont be able to compare it to the beer fresh though since this is my first tasting of this beer.  taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. drinking started at mid-50°s (a guess).  opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. the ring eventually disappears completely leaving a still surface.  very strong aroma. bourbon first then barrel. molasses. slight hint of vanilla.  rich flavor mirroring the aroma. bourbon oak vanilla sweet molasses. adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. toward the finish and into the aftertaste dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol slightly warming my mouth in the after. the finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.  the body is substantial approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).  overall this ba stout is excellent indeed. a rich aroma and flavor a substantial body lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying imperial stout flavors a sweet but controlled sweetness finish. its not a dessert beer but an excellent evening sipping beer. if im feeling like splurging i may actually buy it again!
3203,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.53,review#1600this thing is all barrel but thats not a bad thing in this case. if i had to say something bad about it i would say it is sorta harsh and abrasive at times overpowering and (this sounds dumb) kinda too smooth at other times... unbeer-like if that makes sense tastes like some sort of new better drink that supersedes beer into a more betterer territory
3204,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.35,pours black with leakage to mahogany brown on the edges and a tan head. the nose has oaky boozy barrel notes some dark chocolate and stone fruit.  the barrel is forward on the taste coasting into the dark chocolate and stone fruit notes which works really well. the mouthfeel is full but just the slightest bit watery. overall thought this is outstanding.
3205,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.9,#83 good stuff!
3206,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.52,a slight fizz but then no head. nearly black pours thick. smell is a sweet molasses and caramel. taste is smooth balanced. not as complex as some but still extremely flavorful. plum and molasses. feel is outstanding. creamy and silky smooth. an excellent beer!
3207,Kirin Light Beer,2.93,i definitely dont think its fair or correct that this is rated as the 55th worst beer in the world here on ba i totally disagree and while its not among the best in this light international lager space its certainly not among the worst beers on the planet. i like the new art on it more modern than what is pictured here and i always enjoy these asian ones in the large format never seen this one before now i dont think. anyway the pour is impossibly light lesser than straw colored pretty clear and actually with a pretty and puffy pure white inch of head on it it looks right on actually with lots of carbonation rising up and a nice light golden shine. the nose is minimal but its less chemical and cheap and obviously adjuncty than so many others maybe faintly metallic but not unappealing at all very little hops here but not totally invisible in the aroma lager yeast evident too although also very minimal. the flavor starts off rather refreshing generically grainy to me but nothing weird its thin in feel but the carbonation is so high it never feels watery. its only at the end where it gets a little yucky a strange bitterness rises up hints of rubber and wet paper and it lingers through the very dry finish unpleasantly on the tongue not sure what this is its an unfamiliar flaw almost lightly smoky somehow a faint molten plastic element too but really kind of distinct to this. a shame because it was cooking along just fine before this. still it doesnt ruin this drink and this ended up being a fine sushi companion way better than its ratings here especially compared against only similar items. not sure why this has fallen so far down the list id drink it again...
3208,Kirin Light Beer,1.98,poured from a brown bottle into a clear glass. pour was a little yellowish in color with very little head. smell is ??? the taste is weak and almost like beer. overall this was lacking in flavor and everything else.
3209,Kirin Light Beer,4.04,(12 oz bottle bottled on 10feb21; purchased cold single from shangys two days ago... poured into a 14 oz mug)  l: brilliantly-clear pale brass-colored liquid; fizzy fleeting white foam on the pour gone in two minutes leaving a thin collar... no lacing  s: grain husk hint of sulfur light lemony accent... relatively high intensity; could smell it as it poured  t: surprisingly bold flavors crackery and doughy malt of course cut rather dry but with that husky flavor swelling up in the aftertaste... after a few beats some bready and lemon pithy notes emerge and linger  f: smooth light-bodied flow... not much contour or drag... mildly fizzy; light peppery warmth... dry but not cut clipped or parching... if it was slightly more cut quick and honed itd be darn near perfect  o: despite the age of the bottle this example was in relatively good condition and im pleased that it was more than passable and enjoyable for its kind... i could totally see getting this as a cheap palate-cleaning accompaniment to wings (1965)
3210,Kirin Light Beer,4.74,beer lovers will not be taking home any gold medals for how many people have watched the tokyo beer games so far.  in several major markets around the world the beer audience has fallen since 2016 as beer drinking becomes more fragmented and drinkers drink in japan when audiences are mostly asleep in the united states and europe.  while data from the opening beer ceremony and first few nights of beer events indicate that the kirin light is the least drank beer in recent history across europe and in the united states. however drinking kirin light is up in australia and japan.  comparisons with previous beer reviews are imperfect given the different times zones the covid pandemic and fewer beer options in the past but an upward trend is clear.
3211,Kirin Light Beer,4.07,the caramel color looks pleasant but lacks carbonation making the pour a little underwhelming. though it is light and isn’t hoppy it has more flavor than many other light beers. i would definitely drink it again.
3212,Kirin Light Beer,2.75,the pour is hay colored. the taste is watery malty gulpable rice & some sweetness to round it out. i agree that this a bland beer but hey its only 95 calories. this is an easier drinking kirin ichiban lager beer sorry but 3.2% abv is really low btw. cheers! c
3213,Bud Light Lime,2.71,i think this is a good beer to have after working in the hot florida sun. goes down smooth and easy.
3214,Bud Light Lime,2.52,from a 12oz bottle vintage denoted as 22241vm1544. served in a cervoise because fancy.  pours an effervescent pale honey-gold with a scant finger of fizzy suds. the head doesn’t stay around long enough to get much of a look at just leaving the narrowest possible collar and a super-slippery film of what we may refer to as ‘lacing.’  nose is bright and citrusy and otherwise has a faint cereal character. aroma of lime just as advertised.  taste is corny and soapy with tart-tacky citrus. tasting the titular lime corn pops breakfast cereal and seltzer water.  feel is slick and soapy medium-thin bodied with fizzy seltzer-like carbonation. in fact each sip finishes not entirely unlike lime-flavoured seltzer water.  overall absolutely not utterly vile. it’s what the kids are drinking. or at least what one of them left in my fridge.
3215,Bud Light Lime,2.33,24oz can poured in a glass.  on the pour thre fingers of head form with some retention off the bat but after a moment instead of a rocky head forming it got fizzy and dissipated. body is a completely clear gold. for a light lime lager this is looking real fake.  aroma is mostly the same lime flavor that comes on hint of lime chips which i don\t hate probably because of the real lime peels used. in the back there is a carbonic acid aroma like generic seltzer water with a very light bud light funk. smells blandly acidic with a hint of lime.  taste follows the aroma but admittedly loses the off flavors. still however those is very bland and would probably be most enjoyable after a strong malt liquor while outside in very hot weather. this is about as flavorful as a lime truly but with a slight and light reminder that this is beer with a very vague malt character at the end.  feel is the only decent category here. it is drinkable like regular bud light but it almost comes off as even more watery. despite that the lime flavoring amd possible sweetener makes the finish long amd a bit syrupy. meh.  overall the only reason to drink this is if you cant afford leinies summer shandy but you desperately need something different than the cheap lagers in the 24oz cooler at the gas station.
3216,Bud Light Lime,3.7,whats a better lime beer than this? to all craft beer snobs/women what is better. just buy regular beer that doesnt taste like dogshit. if you want something strong pour a real glass. this forum is fucking sad
3217,Bud Light Lime,3.56,out of all the lime flavored beers its the most refreshing on a hot day.
3218,Bud Light Lime,4.74,look: light haze like looking through a deeply familiar cozy mist rolling through the family farmstead.  smell: rivaled only by traversing through the fields of tecomán on a warm day at peak lime season.  taste: like plucking its carefully-blended native fruit off of a tree and sipping its gently-fermented contents through a frosted platinum-lined metal straw.  feel: silky. soft. comfortable. horse blanket on a frigid autumn morning. nostalgic and pure; truly joyous! unmistakable and irreplaceable.  overall: the perfect beer. overlooked but likely not for long. many are behind on this one but it will have its day and when it does i do genuinely hope budweiser (keep an eye on this beermaker) can meet customer demand.
3219,Bud Light Lime,1.08,i beseech thee why did anyone think we needed this? sadly better than bud light regular. tastes like beer vomit but at least its got the character that plain light beer doesnt....
3220,Bud Light Lime,1.37,look: same as budlight clear yellow  smell: lime thats it  taste: tates like really bad limes  feel: nothing its still water  overall: congratulations you just drank lime water with a hint of alcohol.
3221,XXXX Gold,2.92,bottle ($7 aud in port douglas australia):  forgettable neutral fare with no faults.  c / average
3222,XXXX Gold,5,during my visit to queensland i fell in love with xxxx gold. now that i am back in the united states i cant find this beer anywhere. if it is available in the states someone please let me know.
3223,XXXX Gold,2.14,xxxx gold. the midstrength heart and soul of australias. yoyos with vb as the nations most popular beer but in queensland its holy water. ive personally never liked it too watery too thin too tasteless. but today im going to take my beer goggles off drop my snobberyayour thirst quickly easily with no fuss and not get you too smashed up in the unforgiving tropical heat that is queensland.  look - 2.5/5: the iconic gold can referred to as a mango in queensland (drinking out of the can is known as sucking on a mango) is pretty iconic. and you gotta admit bright yellow can australia sunshine happiness. poured into a standard ikea tumbler rough pour an extremely filtered clear golden colour. slightly darker than the can itself. frothy bubbly white soapsuds head its a classic aussie adjunct.  smell - 2.25/5: corn wet grassy hops and bitterness provided by the pride of ringwood obviously some light biscuit malt. ive smelt this time and time and time again mix and match any aussie adjunct lager.  taste 2/5 - cereal grain light bitterness from the hops light maltiness watery almost like im drinking a flavoured sparkling mineral water beer flavoured mineral water with a slight chemical aftertaste.  feel: 2.25/5 - highly carbonated watery thin but on a 35 degree 80% plus humidity day up in far north queensland thats what you need.  overall: outside of queensland the northern territory or north-western western australia this is a terrible terrible beer. i know its a midstrength lager but hell even great northern super crisp has a better overall flavour than xxxx gold. however in those aforementioned months particularly during the summer months of the year this is an excellent brew. its thin crisp enough highly quaffable and being a 3.5% beer you can drink a few of them and still be in a condition to do stuff afterwards. and thats where and when ill accept xxxx gold as an acceptable beverage. because those are the conditions this beer is brewed for. you wouldnt go drinking a super thick iipa or a stout in those conditions no. and you shouldnt be drinking this in the snowy mountains of nsw in the depths of winter (unless you were driving you were being sensible and theres no other light-mid option). to me its always tasted like a beer flavoured mineral water.
3224,XXXX Gold,2.85,gold in color with with excellent clarity. there’s a fingernail of eggshell white around the rim and covering all but a sliver of the top. light lacing. the aroma is of corn and a hint of grassy hops. i’m tasting a bit of diacetyl and some grassy hops at the back of the palate. the mouth is watery and thin.
3225,XXXX Gold,2.9,best by august 20th 2019. can.  looks gold enough to me. pretty fluffy head of foam lacing is good.  simple nose of corny grain some but not enough of that aussie malt mild touch of hops.  no surprises in the taste. light flavours it is 3.5%abv of corn/grain tiny malt sweetness low presence of hoppy bitterness. served cold cuz i reckoned that would put it at its optimum.  pretty decent mouthfeel considering.  nice to try once.
3226,XXXX Gold,3.12,the very definition of a mid beer... an australian domestic made for the working class sitting at 3.5% and 375ml which equals 1 “standard” drink. allowing people to manage their alcohol intake at places where you need to drive out in the bush the beach the pub home after work this beer is extremely popular because it targeted a demographic of people on the move.  goes down best with fish and chips from your local or after mowing the lawn on a hot and humid aussie day ice cold. 3.5% means it lacks much punch however it can feel a bit watery as well as lack carbonation from time to time. clear bright and orangy-yellow one finger of head when poured however due to my fondness of this domestic drop i prefer i straight out of the dark bottle its just an icon of suburban brisbane. not a classy beer but a well mapped and demographically targeted beer that’s just very average. it is popular here for a reason!!
3227,XXXX Gold,4,the weak little brother of xxxx bitter. a welcomed introduction to allow red blooded aussies to consume 2 tins in the first hour and 1 every hour after that and still be able to drive home without the risk of losing your licence for 2 years and having your car crushed under the draconian nanny state eye. thanks xxxx. ps. its actually pretty ordinary but hey any beer on the way home is better than none.
3228,XXXX Gold,2.07,draft at nannup hotel and pub. tastes and smells like wallpaper paste. clear hold n body with weak head. bland and not very tasty these pasty lagers sure are popular in the bush.
3229,Lunch,4.43,bottle pour beyond the recommended 90-day freshness date but... opaque golden yellow color with white foam. lemon and grapefruit flavors with a hint of cinnamon/graham cracker in the malt base. a delicious ipa.
3230,Lunch,4.1,poured from a bottle into a pint glass. pours orange yellow with a fluffy white head. smells of piney and citrus hops. tastes of citrus and tropical fruit. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall a very good beer.
3231,Lunch,4.68,exceptionally delicious. flies under radar aromatically. upon sipping flourishes of peach pine clementine guava passionfruit deep herbal zing. massive green flood of vegetal garden. aggressive allium zing cleaned up with deep crisp malt. the hops explode for days and days and days. ends nice and wet letting you sop up and savor the sugary abundance of lupulins and choice grain and hop oils. uniquely superb modern “india pale ale” in its potency at only 7% abv.” a sort of heady toppa / pliny contender for me. exquisite stuff! thank you.
3232,Lunch,4.56,i got this on a flight while visiting putnam ct. i’ll definitely have to order more of this. the smell is subtle but the taste is awesome. the feel is almost creamy but it is not a nitro. great ipa!
3233,Lunch,4.35,bottled 6/13/23 so under 60 days old.  l: pours a hazy amber/orange into a teku. foamy white head that leaves light lacing.  s: pine orange grapefruit with big tropical notes as well.  t: grapefruit pith and pine resin with an appropriate caramel malt backbone. perfectly balanced.  f: medium bodied with above average carbonation. resin-y finish.  o: i tried this a year ago and liked it but didn’t understand the hype. much better the second time around. the west and east coast elements balance each other out to make a delicious brew! the only reason i don’t see myself buying this all the time is the format— 16oz glass bottle. 12 oz. cans please!
3234,Lunch,4.06,bought from a whole foods in munster in. the bottled date says april 23 2023 putting it right on the edge of the freshness date but i was curious. poured from the 1 pint 9 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. the beer is a pure orange color topped with a foamy off white head that leaves chunky lacing on the glass. some sediment within.  smell: a great balanced refreshing smell. citrus and floral. grapefruit and honey. caramel malt. sweet but in a tropical way not sugary. some pine balances things out. nice.  taste: citrus rind and some resin balanced by a slight honey sweetness and caramel malt. bright throughout. finishes surprisingly balanced and clean. slight pine remains.  overall: super refreshing and drinkable. i would pick this out again with no hesitation. i really want to try this again when fresher as i feel like some of the character has already mellowed out a bit. but still tasty.
3235,Lunch,4.38,lol this is a top wcipa … from maine! pours lusty deep golden nectar with a thick and remaining head aroma includes citrus pith and pine tastes fruity piney sticky with a bit of malt back. smack in mouth legendary ipa and yea i own a mbc glass. super tasty and top notch
3236,Lunch,4.28,canned 4/3/23 (4 months ago)  appearance: pours a slightly cloudy (60% clarity) bright and vibrant deep orange color with a strong and thick white head that lingers. srm of 10. (4.50)  aroma: strong aromas of grapefruit citrus nectarines oranges and pine. a little bit of tropical notes as well. smooth malts underneath. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of oranges nectarines grapefruits. pine and yeast follow with a smooth caramel malt body for a soft balance. some bitterness from the pine dances for a minute before a smooth and slightly sweet finish. (4.25)  feel: medium to heavier bodied strong carbonation and yeast. strong malt profile but not overly sweet. hides the booze completely. (4.50)  overall: currently ranked as the #11 on beeradvocate i was finally able to pick this up. brewed since 2011. beautiful pour. the aromas and flavors are subtle yet complex. shines in the mouthfeel as it has that bitter west-coast flavor but also a smooth malt body. no trace of booze or any hop burn here. a delicately balanced wonderful ipa. (rating: 4.28)
3237,Lunch,4.52,a great beer. well balanced in wc style. poured into a pub glass at portsmouth book and bar a light amber with a moderate head of golden tan color. the rich hops bitterness and profile lingers on the palate.
3238,Lunch,4.46,500 ml bottle into a stemmed pint glass  man i love these wc/hazy hybrids when done right. toppling goliath 3f’s come to mind. some of my favorite breweries out here in socal just left some of their coveted wc styles unfiltered which were tasty in themselves but not quite the same as this. and modern times kind of cut their teeth on the style but their ipa’s have gotten redundant imo.  anyway this beer is a knockout…crisp and citrusy with a subtly juicy finish. i’d say if you didn’t look at it you’d guess it’s more of a west coast style with that grassy/piney thing going on but it’s definitely unfiltered and hazy in appearance.
3239,Hennepin,4.68,this is another one of those beers that have been around and drinking here and there so long that im surprised i havent reviewed it. pours a cloudy gold with a huge white head. cant fit the 12oz bottle in a pint glass. excellent retention bands of lace aromas of green banana ginger white pepper savory herbs a bit of citrusy coriander. sweet bready malt flavor with an awesome herb and spice component; i get celery flat-leaf parsley coriander ginger white pepper and a bit of clove along with some green banana and pear. light bodied effervescent fluffy and satisfying mouthfeel really set the standard for american brewed clean saisons.
3240,Hennepin,4.35,pours a clear golden color with a runaway tall foamy head and heavy lacing.  smells of yeast banana citrus and spice.  tastes of sweet malt belgian yeast orange pear and apple with an alcohol warm peppery finish.  medium light body with moderate carbonation. slightly syrupy smooth mouthfeel.  this is a very tasty well-made brew.
3241,Hennepin,4.25,look: huge head that receded quickly smell: yeast lemon orange little bit of banana marshmallow maybe; touch of pear taste: follows nose with the fruit flavors especially lemon peel; celery taste (maybe what others are calling coriander) considerable bitterness a hint of sweetness i did get the ginger but it took me a while; a little funky; wintery spices quite a luscious beer finishes dry but with a sweet tingle; pleasant carbonation low viscosity but still creamy with the foam and crisp on the whole i like the spices and flavors of this beer. a good modern saison. i got this one from whole foods.
3242,Hennepin,4.12,procured in a trade/proxy arrangement with @turkeysdrinkbeer in february 2022. drink in october that year.  l: there are orange cordial vibes going on with the presentation of this beer making my mouth water before i even contemplate putting my nose into the glass. theres no head bar a small rim around the edges. sediment from the full-bottle pour hangs suspended in the beer barely ruffled by the few large bubbles of carbonation that dart to the top of the glass.  s: on the nose theres a slight yeast note and an indefinable tanginess that hangs in the aroma.  t: the taste has sweet orange sherbety orange pith and yeast - that orange note probably accounting for the tanginess i picked up on the nose. the orange is followed by a musty slightly aniseed note. its probably the coriander and whatever bird-of-paradise grain is. or perhaps its the last vestiges of the yeast playing with those spices. regardless its extremely tasty and definitely compels a second mouthful straight after the first.  m: on the tongue theres almost a sherbety quality to the beer but its followed by a spritzy snap after the swallow and it dries things out quickly after that point. 4.25  o: this beer comes together extremely well. the taste is somewhat unique and the mouthfeel and nose only add to that impression. i wonder if i could drink more than one of these though as i can imagine palate fatigue setting in quickly with such a sweet sherbety beer. it treads this side of the cloyingly sweet line well but volume could push it over. based on drinking one rather than several however it stands up very well.  cheers!
3243,Hennepin,3.98,great taste of a european farm house ale slightly sour
3244,Hennepin,4.02,awesome saison that most people could pick up and enjoy. love the color on this and the foam sticks around forever. bright orangey taste with a bit of ginger some delightful malty sweetness. smell is a bit off-putting: very sour and yeasty a bit funky. but its a very pleasing drink would definitely get it again. ommegang is consistently excellent
3245,Hennepin,4.13,this was actually pretty close to excellent for me great floral notes grassy underpinnings and a good citrus finish. i liked this one more than i thought i would
3246,Hennepin,4,expected a little more from this brew for the price and the rating. enjoyed the carbonation (akin to with a semisweet sparkling wine mouthfeel) but overall it tasted too much like booze and spices. i got mine from a 4-pack at a grocery so maybe a draft experience would be different. might seek out again.
3247,Hennepin,4.21,nice golden color with a real lively foam head. great spicy notes to the nose like clove nutmeg. nice spice on the palate slight funk and bitterness. and the carbonation is good. cant go wrong drinking ommegang.
3248,Beelzebub,4.71,a: pours a motor oil black with a thick brown head with solid retention and lacing. s: roasted notes with hints of earthy hops: t: meaty roasted porter notes with surprisingly balancing earthy hop notes; subtle sweet alcohol notes. m: silky smooth o: very well balanced beer; excellent.
3249,Beelzebub,3.85,black with two fingers of mocha head. big air bubbles lead to quick dissipation. soap bubble lacing.  chocolate coffee and pine in the nose.  taste is similar: chocolate strong umami some sugared coffee light pine and dry finish. bitter aftertaste.  medium bodied slick feel with restrained carbonation.  solid beer but to my taste the dryness distracts a bit from the lovely piney bitterness.
3250,Beelzebub,4.4,16 oz can poured into a tulip  a- black with a two finger mocha head.  s- dark chocolate roasted malts earthy hops hints of citrus some char.  t- dark chocolate roasted malts pineyearthy some char touch of the citra dry hopping.  m- smooth full body.  o- a well done stout and it aged gracefully. i think i got this in a box of beer in 2017 or 2018 and i just forgot to drink it right away but have no issue with what time has done to this beer.
3251,Beelzebub,5,from can into tulip glass. amazing aroma of hops as soon as i poured it. taste is all stout with chocolate and cocoa. an unbelievable combo of a strong stout but with hops in background. great beer!
3252,Zombie Dust,4.88,yeah man the reviews and the hype are spot on here. my friend who only drinks busch light had 2 cans in his fridge and i about had a dang heart attack. this beer isnt available in may area but his friend from out of town had left them and he let me try them. holy cow! i was blown away that a pale ale could be so complex. honestly it was almost perfect in every way. not too hoppy or malty. great mouthfeel and perfectly balanced flavor with some fruit notes up front. trust me when i say its one of the best beers out there period.
3253,Zombie Dust,4.1,poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is slightly hazed gold head presents 1 finger thick dissipates to solid top with some lacing.  smell is crisp citric and earth hops pale malt light toast.  taste is hop forward - notes of citrus earth light pine pale malt and lighter caramel and toast some herbal qualities emerge with warmth.  mouthfeel is moderate carbonation moderate sweetness moderate bitterness.  overall a very good apa - it does seem slightly aged so would like to try again closer to canning date but even still would expect a bit more malt out of an apa this highly rated.
3254,Zombie Dust,3.23,this is an old school west coast ipa not bad just out of fashion with new hszy craze. this one delivers the malt and hops 10 years ago my revies may have been more favorable.
3255,Zombie Dust,4.39,a very good beer if you were an ipa fan. i had it on draft in leesburg virginia and it’s from indiana?! this would compete with any west coast beer
3256,Zombie Dust,4.09,12 oz can from total wine in short pump va the ale poured a hazy amber with a white foamy head and lacing. the aroma of citrus mostly grapefruit and orange. the flavors are mostly grapefruit and pale malts. the ale has a medium body and average carbonation. this is a top-notch pale ale.
3257,Zombie Dust,4.5,the hops are assertive even bitter in the aftertaste but not painful. a slight sweetness and juicy fruitiness on the nose and at first sip before the hops crash in. great combination of late-boil aroma hops and early-boil bittering hops. the flavor is dynamic (not static) as you sip. this is a beer for someone who likes bitter. 3 floyds is one of the benefits to living in the midwest right after the cost of living and the sweetcorn.
3258,Zombie Dust,4.48,solid pale ale. it is a bit light on the tongue but other than that really nice and truly well balanced.
3259,Zombie Dust,5,one of my top picks for a great ipa. my biggest hate is its not available where i live.
3260,Zombie Dust,4.02,12oz brown bottle  three floyds zombie dust has a clear gold/amber colored body and atop sat a 1 ½-finger white foamy head. the head had good retention and left behind nice lacing. the nose was dominated by citrus; grapefruit orange and lemon were noted. the taste follows the nose but is fuller and light malt is also evident. the finish is bitter and dry. mouth feel is medium bodied that is crisp and dry with a bitter finish.  zombie dust is a well-made american pale ale that is a little too hoppy for this non hophead.
3261,Rhetorica,4.34,on draft at hill farmstead.  russet brown body with a thick khaki hues head. ample lacing / residue.  clean and easy drinking. biscuit cracker malty. light medium body. delicious.
3262,Rhetorica,4.94,growler purchased from hill farmstead brewery in greensboro bend vt.  this one pours a very creamy looking dark black color with a fluffy white head and lots of lacing.  this smells like lightly roasted malt creamy milk and dark chocolate both with some light spicing rye bread and coffee.  this is absolutely one of the best dark lagers in the entire country and one of the best i’ve ever had. it’s just so luxuriously creamy and soft – it could taste like nothing and still be enjoyable with how luxuriously it drinks. but luckily there’s a lot of complexities here – rye coffee light hop spice lots of creamy chocolate and just a wisp of roast that carries this thing home.  this is super creamy rich while remaining light and soft a really really good pour. it’s unbelievably drinkable i’m sad i shared the growler because drinking the whole thing would have been the easiest thing i’ve ever done.  this is the best lager that hill farmstead has ever done and it’s in general one of their best beers ever.
3263,Rhetorica,3.93,draft at hill farmstead. dark muddy brown pour with a thick creamy off-white head rings of lacing. light roasty aroma chocolate. taste is malty nutty light chocolate creamy smooth. mild bitterness at the finish.
3264,Rhetorica,4.61,growler filled on 7/15/22; consumed on 7/28/22  pours a ruddy lightly fogged deep mahogany body capped with two fingers of creamy beige foam; solid head retention yields a half-finger of cap a large frothy collar and a healthy spattering of spotty/webby lacing drawn out across the walls of the glass.  aromas of fresh brown toast decompile vibrant yeastiness as subtle coffee grounds texture waves of minerality across the bouquet; touches of smoky toffee and a milk cocoa dusting are interspersed throughout a calm level presentation of roast.  taste opens to a soft lager yeast and wisp of oaky prickle into spent coffee grounds coating a subtle hop twinge; a touch of cocoa powder and shaved almonds over the mid-palate bring a noncommittal sweetness as brown bread crusts carry roast into the back end and a quaint minerality finishes.  mouthfeel shows a light-medium body and a rounded creamy fluff of moderate-high carbonation; silky level textures phase into a fuzzy bitterness interspersed with a steady drying on the back end and ultimately clean finish sporting a distant refined roast.  complex layering of roasty sweetness finds a luxuriously textured parity with gentle oak underpinnings and whispering hop subtext in a preeminent summation of rustic tradition; a pure and stunning composition.
3265,Rhetorica,4.39,750 ml growler filled 7/13/22 drank on 7/18/22  pours a dark caramel brown with moderate head. nice malty yeast and bread aromas. pleasant mild taste…caramel nutty toasted malt. light carbonation. not overly familiar with this style but i imagine this is a superb example. great change up from my usual ipas
3266,Rhetorica,4.25,good beer in its class.
3267,Rhetorica,4.65,on tap at hf.  i almost didn’t get this thank goodness i did. khaki head. lace. dark caramel brown color.  toasted chestnuts and caramel. cocoa and chocolate. smooth silky creamy. light earthy/spicy hop profile.  light bodied but packed with flavor. this is a treat.
3268,Rhetorica,4.55,pours a dark brown with tints of red a touch of haze and a towering fluffy head from the side-pull tap. the aroma is of fresh baked bread caramel and a touch of chocolate. the flavor is very rich for the strength lots of melanoidin and a nutty chocolate finish. medium bodied but very fluffy and low carb. a top notch dark lager one of my favorites from hill farmstead.
3269,Leffe Blonde,3.77,11.2 ounce bottle poured into (ahem..) an opaque plastic cup at a french bistro in aventura mall in florida. ‘best by may 2024’ so it’s fresh. 6.6% abv. big ole thick creamy head pops up and crowns. aroma of familiar belgian yeast mild clove little perfumey.. taste is pretty spot on for a belgian blond. herbs clove touch of banana light malt a vanilla note tad of bitter. feel is joyously mid-dense active carbonation. overall right fine accent to an almond croissant. will stand up on its own too.
3270,Leffe Blonde,3.73,after a dip in form for this brewery theres been a big improvement in quality again imo. nicely balanced and carbonated yeasty and slightly spicy notes. taste follows with slight honey and a woody and bready finish. decent feel and a decent blond comparatively for a macro brewery. glad to see its on the up again.
3271,Leffe Blonde,3.08,yields a golden color with a big froth head atop.  smells of wet wood cardamom and unripe green banana among notes of allspice and dried grass.  has a light body with a well accentuated higher carbonation level revealing a mineralic quality leading to a well working refreshment.  tastes of honey melting toffee and rustic grains among soothing bread dough and a faint note of dry leaves. offers a sprizzy middle part with the beer‘s carbonation becoming more prominent together a sweet rock sugar malt backbone. finishes with a mineralic burst more honey and a prevailing maltiness.  solid blond with a convincing balance to it.
3272,Leffe Blonde,4.09,put off trying this for years assuming i’d drink it in europe one day. and indeed i have. snagged a tall can in paris. most of the beer here is belgian naturally. this is enjoyable especially considering the average score. yeasty funky and slightly spicy. quite good would drink again. a 6.6% can with a best by date of 12/2024
3273,Leffe Blonde,3.46,re-reviewing as it was a long time since i reviewed this...will review the brune next...cool bottle design used to drink this a lot in the past and it was one of my favorite beers though these were the days of being brought up surrounded by lagers and diamond white...so this was my first taste of a real beer.  aside from stella this must be the 2nd most mass produced beer from belgium i think. i used to drink it lots in australia...as australian beers are usually pretty terrible.  good creamy froth that stays in the glass. some quite large bubbles. aroma is banana and cloves.  flavour has elements of soy sauce haha i always thought this. there is a herbiness coming through and elements of orange peel cloves lemon peel and more soy sauce. its not as complex as the best belgian beers but considering this is mass produced by inbev its still pretty good. but it lacks the mouth feel and complexity of an unpasteurized trappist ale. according to the bottle it contains added vanilla also. now that i have read this i can taste a little vanilla ; ) but banana is more noticeable there is a little vanilla in the aftertaste.  the taste isnt particularly smooth...its kind of angry and chaotic...and it tastes like it contains more alcohol than it actually does. a westervelen 12 or rochefort 10 both taste like they contain less alcohol than this.  very good but not quite great. happy to drink this again though from memory sometimes the bottles actually go bad before you drink them so be careful. or maybe this was just my dads cellar. the flavour is a bit too soy saucy for me though still one of the best mass produced beers out there for sure.  ok onwards to the brune ; )
3274,Leffe Blonde,1,this was my favourite beer of all time for over 10yrs unfortunately the rights were sold to a brazilian brewer who immediately set about destroying it! its been dropped from 6.6% to 6.0% and the original flavour is a past memory tastes of very little but a revolting metallic after taste and its also now heavily carbonated and holds no head whatsoever.  this is headed for 4.5% and in the gutter with pissy heineken etc! i kind of knew it was going bad the moment they switched from corks to metal caps on the 750ml btls a few years later theyve proved me right!  some of the home keg sellers still have 6.6% kegs my advice is to snap them up theyre the last of the original.  absolute shame that this once fantastic beer has been sold out!
3275,Leffe Blonde,4.15,330ml. bottle in vientiane laos. pours a clear light amber. aroma of malt light hops clove and sweet fruits.light acidity lightly bitter. medium body watery texture moderate carbonation. a good belgian ale deserving of its popularity.
3276,Leffe Blonde,3.55,poured from a 330ml bottle . 6% .  not sure whats going on with the lower abv  brewed for uk market perhaps? pours a dark amber  very bubbly and a large bubbled  off white head. the smell is belgian yeast and vague honey and the taste follows on with a slight added fruitiness. the mouthfeel is too syrupy not awful but not good. overall this isnt as good as it used to be but maybe it would be if i got the 6.6% beer. this feels like a dumbing down of a previously much better beer though. disappointed.
3277,Leffe Blonde,3.13,its not bad for the price but it is not in the same league as a great belgian blonde like delirium tremens. the ba score of 81 is generous. it lacks crispness and finishes a little too sweet. the body is light but it retains a head and creates good lacing. heavy hops are not expected in this style but it could use more bitterness. overall it tastes like a mass-produced belgian ale which is exactly what it is.
3278,Leffe Blonde,4.1,bottle from john’s poured into tulip glass. just a very solid belgian blonde and i love me some belgians.
3279,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.46,w
3280,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.81,another excellent product from what has become my favorite brewery. you can’t go wrong with weihenstephener. this selection is a little difficult to find locally but stumbled upon a good selection in helen ga over the weekend. i will definitely buy again which might require another trip.
3281,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.09,this classic has a roasted malt and dark fruit flavor that is quite nice.
3282,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.32,purity mien frauline! this is like of you took shiner bock and sent them to finishing school. lightly roasty and malty with the sweetness of a dirty brown flower. the germans over-engineer their beer and their cars. you could give this to a newborn. is good yah?
3283,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.36,aroma of roasty malt and chocolate and a body that follows closely -- a refreshing wave of roasted malt chocolate some hickory and spice followed by sweeter cloying chocolate and honey on the back end. a great dark beer.
3284,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.56,poured from a one pint 0.9 fl oz bottle into a ritzenhoff cylindrical mug. bottle date code is 5402.  l- dark deep reddish amber color.  s- deep roasted caramel malt.  t- sweet caramel and pumpernickel.  f- incredibly smooth slightly dry finish. moderate carbonation.  o- an absolutely fantastic doppelbock!
3285,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.45,500ml. bottle in mae kasa thailand. pours a deep cola brown with a medium head. aroma of caramel banana liqorice roasted malt. taste of banana caramel dark fruit chocolate coffee and nuts. complex. interesting. intriguing. impressive. a fine doppelbock.
3286,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,3.95,l: very dark brown frothy tan head that dissipates quickly. s: caramel brown sugar hints of molasses and dark fruit t: nothing surprising given the smell. heavy on the sweet toasted malt. notes of plum and spice. fairly sweet. f: medium/heavy body moderate carbonation somewhat warm finish. also a bit syrupy and sticky.  its pretty good and has well developed flavors although its almost a bit too sweet for my taste.
3287,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.41,the beer is a dark red/brown color. small quickly dissipating tan head. no lace. aroma of dark fruit and sweet malt. taste of molasses plum and raisin. a little more than medium-bodied. very drinkable.
3288,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.22,appearance: poured with barely a feathers worth of head that dissipated immediately. the body though deep dark rich brown when held to the light shows thin but steady carbonation.  smell: predominantly caramel malt but with notes of toffee and a fruit backbone as plum molasses and maybe a hint of pumpernickel bread is present. needs a bit warming but still decently potent upon pour.  taste: rich rich malt as caramel toffee plum and molasses start us off that sugary molasses permeates the beer as notes of raisins nut and i think even a mild rum note come in before we end on a fairly non-descript slight bitter note. that ending is really the only thing holding back the perfect score and that it is just a little bit too rich. still decadent.  mouthfeel: aftertaste is a next mix of malt molasses and rum raisin. carbonation is a bit too low for my liking as i think some creaminess could add something to this. the transitioning is wonderful as it shifts seamlessly.  drinkability: the body is certainly on the thicker side of medium body but the low carbonation here means it settles down incredibly well. it doesnt quite disguise its abv with that rum note and it certainly pushes its weight around but it does it in a good way.  final thoughts: i love weihenstephaner ironically the only thing they brew that i wouldnt say is exceptional (but is still solid) is their standard hefeweizen which is what they are probably most known for. this to me shows they dont necessarily need to stick to wheat to produce something awesome. you really cant go wrong with this brewer.
3289,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.62,pours a dark caramel color and has looks to have lots of carbonation by the bubbles during the pour. the head is foamy but subsides quickly.  the smell is amazing. similar to caramel but there is a distinct smell that is fainly fruity. it almost smells like sugary baked apples. there is a slight booziness.  the flavor is great. if you can stomach a bit of booziness there is rich malty flavor. like caramel toffee and toasted bread. very low in bitterness and not overly sweet. there is a tinge of coffee/toffee in the aftertaste.  the mouthfeel isnt particularly thick or particularly syrupy. it has a good malty balance.  an exceptional beer overall. one of my favorites.
3290,Lagunitas Sucks,3.78,no lagunitas really sucks.
3291,Lagunitas Sucks,4.46,some scrappy notes from 2018. 6 pack of 12 ounce bottles. this beer pours a deep gold color and is crisp and bright tasting. it is sweet and slightly resinous and is extremely easy drinking for its 8% abv. i hope they continue to make it as it is one of my favorites from this brewery. excellent!
3292,Lagunitas Sucks,3.42,355 ml bottle at a breakfast joint in petaluma. deep golden to orange colour large off-white head. aroma and flavour of citrus pine caramel and sweet malts. maybe a bit too far out on the sweet side for me but still a fairly nice beer. some alcohol in the finish. anyway i wouldn’t say that it sucks.
3293,Lagunitas Sucks,4.18,the name sounds like its referring to the brewery with a bit of self-deprecation but its really about 2020. but this beer is the opposite of 2020. its a dry-hopped dipa with an abundance of complex flavors stemming from the multitude of grains used in its brewing. lagunitas really hit the right combination. for a dry-hopped brew it is a nice crisp bitterness. checks all the boxes of a solid dipa with big flavor.
3294,Lagunitas Sucks,3.39,pours a gold color with a creamy white head. a little chill haze. it has a medicine taste maybe because of the abv? its very hop forward but not my pint of beer. i like the regular ipa better. it does taste a little like the year 2020 so theres that.
3295,Country Club Malt Liquor,1.24,if this bottle has a genie hes a greasy extrovert of a genie probably wearing lots of bling and parachute pants.  long ago i helped a stranger who was struggling to unload some heavy items from her car. afterward she thanked me by handing me a can of country club chilled in a cooler in her trunk. this is how an 80s gas station tastes. i havent seen it again but i recall it vividly even now: wet dog corn and alcohol with a modest armada of grit afloat. astounding. it did have a nice sort of metallic can note to be fair.  if i see it again im gonna try it just to remind myself of the benchmark. nothing -- not coors not keystone nothing -- could be as quintessentially awful. the label is a perfect predictor of everything inside. if they stop making country club there will still be plenty left unsold in the gas stations of 2237.
3296,Country Club Malt Liquor,5,there’s nothing like a nice classy country club 40oz in the morning before work during work after work and after a nice classy 40oz of country club. heck i’m country clubbed up right now if i do say so myself the relaxing crips taste the smooth feel down my throat the nice refreshing smell and that beautiful gold and white logo is enough for me to responsibly enjoy at least five country clubs a day. 5/5 good beer.
3297,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.49,i remember this one from back in the day and found it a rare find around here at a backwoods convenience store. i just had to try it again. malt liquors were first marketed to white men back in the 1960\s believe it or not and my grandpa bennett would always crack open an 8-oz. country club or two after work. my mom reportedly gave him holy hell when he was caught giving me a few sips as an 18-month old. i guess that he was just checking to see if the irish parts of my body i.e. those that are involved in processing alcohol intake were working properly. and thus my ghetto taste in beers apparently. anyway i was not too impressed overall. it was flat and corny-tasting with a weird psuedo-metallic aftertaste. as i bought cans i can\t blame any skunking for the less than par experience. still i will give it the benefit of the doubt the six i bought could have been sitting in the cooler for years. wouldn\t try it again though.
3298,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.24,40oz clear glass bottle with a branded screw-top. no abv listed on the label. america\s premium malt liquor.  pours a clear pale copper body with a good 3 fingers worth of off-white foam sitting atop.  aroma yields pale malt and cheap corn lending this some sweetness but seemingly not too much.  taste is of pale malt and a bit of cheap corn adjunct which isnt bad when coupled with the smooth wet light to medium-bodied mouthfeel. i always fear budget malt liquors will be syrupy and sticky but this avoids that.  drinkable albeit forgettable inoffensive fare. i doubt ill ever try it again unless im after a cheap buzz. more insipid than anything else.  d (2.18) / not recommended  *** lucked into another clear 40oz bottle of this. pricetag reads $3.00 (usd). the white and gold label design looks like something out of the reagan era.  pours three fingers/7-8ish cm worth of off-white foam. frothy and billowing. i cant knock it and the retention is pretty nice at 6+ minutes. body is a clear thin watery dark urine colour. no visible yeast or sediment; its obviously filtered.  aroma brings notes of creamed corn and inoffensive pilsner malt along with a cheap grassy hop character. diacetyl and dms are indicated and it seems too sweet. more of a grainy aroma would be nice. average aromatic intensity.  taste is creamed corn dms off-flavour and pilsner malts with some cheap syrupy sweetness dragging it down. too sweet though not egregiously so and ive had more syrupy more thick malt liquors. obviously its unrefreshing but its creamy softness on the palate warrants commendation. smooth and wet and not as overcarbonated as many budget malt liquors.  overall its an inoffensive brew that drinks best at colder temperatures and will satisfy casual drinkers after a cheap buzz. i liked it better this time around than when i initially had it; i imagine these clear bottles sitting around in seedy brooklyn bodegas are at high risk for being lightstruck. not a terrible beer but i cant recommend it even at this budget tier (see ballantine xxx for a more worthwhile choice for budget drinkers).  high d (2.24) / not recommended
3299,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.53,when you drop that beer in the return slot the next day. thats the appearance. sweet corn aroma nod bad for what it is.  woof this gives the big fusel alcohol feels. not even that strong but it amps it up on your breath. its some high bitterness low hops high alcohol corn malt bill type of malt liquor but without the punch even though its mouthfeel kinda makes you think maybe otherwise.
3300,Country Club Malt Liquor,3.06,i am a gross fat monster and so ive been looking for country club for years.  i read somewhere once that it was the first high-ish abv beer that was directly marketed a malt liquor and ive come across more than a few old print ads showing fifties-era frat boys pouring this stuff out of what look like pudding cans while coeds stumble in the background. it would be another decade plus until ads came along that were brazen enough to directly implicate malt liquor with date rape (thanks billy dee williams!) but we still got country club to thank for that trend. needless to say this beer has long been on my must-try list.  forties were just sitting at the bottom of the cooler in some gas station in the middle of upstate new york. i jokingly told the clerk that i thought they stopped making it in the 70s. he said they might have considering how poorly they sold at this particular location so that didnt bode too well for its freshness.  untwisting the cap however i pick up only a faint whiff of skunk which is actually kinda complimentary in a weird way (some green bottle euro saisons milk this effect quite well). the skunk is almost exclusively aromatic however as the flavor is neigh indistinguishable from mickeys. trust me ive drank a lot of mickeys and this is just a skunked mickeys.  which isnt bad in my book even if its not exactly good. i wouldnt drink mickeys so goddamn often if i truly disliked its flavor. its not for beer geeks yeah. but as a malt liquor served in 40s it gets the job done and is absolutely inoffensive.
3301,Country Club Malt Liquor,3.23,i had been seeking this out for a long time. i found it at a liquor store in waltham ma one summer day in 2012. it was found in the customary 40 ounce bottle just sitting there with a gaggle of other 40\s; as if to scream out take me home. i bought it and took it to where i was staying. i cracked open the bottle to find wafts of skunk but these skunky scents did not deter me from enjoying this malt. the taste was something else like a classic malt liquor should taste: sweet malts and a hint of adjunct.  i was able to consume the \club. overall i\d have this again. since that day however i have been unable to find it; s though the beer gods seem to have said only once.
3302,Country Club Malt Liquor,3.9,(half quart can mar0920; purchased cold 2-for-1 pack - poured into fat tulip; re-review 15 oct 2019)  l: crystal-clear light gold liquid; speckled sediment... foam sizzles away immediately leaves a thin spit-y collar...  s: corn syrup and sweetish pale malt dull hint of green grass and/or old desiccated citrus peel... overall intensity moderate; no overt booze  t: relatively richly malty long malty finish subtle orange/champagne hard candy note on the very back... before second sip bit of toasted grain (barley and corn) toasted caramel lingering with the latters subtle butterfinger-y character... marginal perception of (peppery) bitterness likely alcohol-derived  f: light-medium bodied but noticeably extended delicately viscous subtly warm finish... soft carbonation; a bit lip-smacky within the interior jowls  o: canned version obviously has a vastly superior taste to the skunk bladder tankard found within the 40... finally found cans (kept my eye open for years now)... this has jumped several places in my malt liquor list maybe even now top 5; it got what i need  original review of 2.66 on 22 oct 2015 (40 oz bottle feb1516 thin tulip pour) l: 3 - gold liquid; thin foam little lace s: 2 - skunky as hell but malty beery t: 2.75 - malty skunky cardboard f: 3.5 - light-bodied silky flow acid/sizzle residual film o: 2.75 - skunky lousy but worth seeking canned version (see above)
3303,Hazy Rays,3.13,oh darn - lawsons usualy sets the bar very very high but this one ws a big miss for me..sos and ls so good this is the opposite. thin almost tasteless where is the juicy this one needs a redo.
3304,Hazy Rays,3.77,agree with others that this from a fave rare brewer getting bigger is also-ran lightweight ne ipa. a) totally hazy pour of weak yellow color and a 4 due to lasting lacing head. s) agree that its citrus and grapefruit meets pine with some dankness. t) follows aroma adds some spicyiness and perfume reduction. not my cup of tea. f) chalky drinks big for modest abv then juicy finale. o) mid-pack but original  and aside from the bait and switch on appearance the palate is also more spicy and bitter than your typical new england ipa especially since the can also describes it as juicy. while it does have citrus qualities its more dank and piney.  it\d be fine if they simply did what they do with sip of sunshine and called it a fucking ipa without any other promises but this doesn\t even hit their own mark let alone the national standard for the style today.
3305,Hazy Rays,4.38,a really nice and flavorful light hazy ipa. great for summer drinking and very poundable. not bitter at all. decent body for a light beer as well. highly recommend.
3306,Hazy Rays,4.75,super-bangin’ hazy pale. perfect balance of light crisp malt deep hop presence gentle pale. the feel is pretty effervescent nice sweetness mid palate but wraps up very dry. this is a very unique pretty flawless brew. fills a great niche of sessionable juicy hazy but extremely clean. yum.
3307,Hazy Rays,3.54,mostly clear dull gold with a tall and puffy white foam head. cmon man you cant straight up name the beer hazy and have it be this clear especially from vermont in this day and age!  and aside from the bait and switch on appearance the palate is also more spicy and bitter than your typical new england ipa especially since the can also describes it as juicy. while it does have citrus qualities its more dank and piney.  it\d be fine if they simply did what they do with sip of sunshine and called it a fucking ipa without any other promises but this doesn\t even hit their own mark let alone the national standard for the style today.
3308,Hazy Rays,4.18,tasty new offering done right. had a real piney element to it without losing some of that citra hop flavor and fruitiness. its a hair sweet in my opinion but definitely not disruptive. win.  one bullshit thing that i felt betrayed on was the can— it was just a purple plastic wrapper around a scragg mountain pills can!
3309,Hazy Rays,3.34,12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99. pkg 02jun23 so this is like 70 days old (2 months plus).  look: it is quite hazy but not super turbid or opaque looking. its still somewhat translucent. its yellowish orange in color leaning towards yellowish. it looks a lot like white grapefruit juice. there was about a finger of whitish head that dissipated to ring around the glass.  smell: tons of grapefruit on the nose. after swirling the glass i get some medicinal notes? perhaps a bit chalky and reminiscent of chewable vitamins. this sounds weird but i also get a subtle butterscotch-flavored hard candy note very much like a brachs or dum dum lollipop. some earthy and grassy notes on the finish. the nose is actually relatively closed and not so expressive.  taste: interesting. theres something bizarre about this beer; up front it tastes like a lot of other hoppy citrus-forward beers lots of grapefruit character. but then you swallow it and theres almost no bitterness and it almost feels like you are drinking a soda. its really weird and i just dont get it. the finish is very short and thin.  feel: highly carbonated with a carbonic acid / soda- or seltzer-like feel. the finish is very short and thin. i would say that this beer is light to medium bodied.  overall: this beer fell short for me. overall ive been pretty impressed with lawsons finest liquids but this offering is not my cup of tea. im not sure if they are trying to cater to a different kind of audience or what but i would say that this beer does not appeal to old school beer drinkers. and i dont think that it really appeals to new school beer drinkers either so thats what im saying when i mention i dont know who their target audience is with this one. oh well.
3310,Hazy Rays,4.03,light hazy straw color with no head or lace. has a strong pleasant aroma of citrus lemon and flowery hops. taste follows the smell balanced citrus and hops. very easy drinking and crisp feel. this beer is fine but prefer little sip and sip of sunshine from this brewery....far bolder taste profile.
3311,Hazy Rays,3.81,a little hazy but definitely bright gold with a nice white cap of foam. nose is fragrant citrus. on the palate this beer is refreshing with an orange tang and a clean dry finish. at 5.3% abv this can work as a session beer. throw in a warm summer day--perfection!
3312,Hazy Rays,4,lawson\s finest liquids hazy rays 1 pint can pkg 02may23 18:20:18 and sampled on 15jul23 $12.99/4pk @ total wine & more cherry hill nj  notes via stream of consciousness: its surprisingly light in color just a straw gold which leads me to believe its got a lot of oats in it. whats the strength on this one? its just 5.3% (.3 more than budweiser) which explains a lot as well. its definitely hazy and maybe even cloudy like a hefeweizen. the head is a fingers width of bright white foam that doesnt look like its going to hold up any better than most. in the nose its got some hop resins to it and fruity notes of orange and mango. the flavor delivers a fairly light maltiness that does include a bit of oat but im not clearly getting wheat. the hops remain mainly orange-like in character with some additional mango and apricot. its not a bold beer in any way and keeping with that the bitterness is limited. in the mouth its light-medium in body and silky smooth across the palate. this is an easy drinking beer thats got a lot more character to it than most beers of 5% and although it wont knock founders all day ipa off my top rack as a session ipa (its just 4.7% and hoppier) its a fairly good option. review #8684
3313,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.48,tastes like a typical malt liquor the head disappears very quickly little carbonation. not an especially terrible beer but nothing special either. average the 8% alc./vol. kicks in like most similar types of extra strong beer. will take a pass on this one from now on.
3314,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.54,red horse extra strong is crystal clear and pale amber in color. thin streams of carbonation support a cloudy bone white head with fairly average retention. taking a sniff the first thing i smell is generic almost sugary sweetness. soda cracker comes in second lending support to the up front aromas of sugar. aromas of malt and sugar lead into a center where i smell corn adjuncts and the lagery whiff of sulfur. mix in the alcoholic burn of this beers 8% abv and the aroma takes on a vaguely white wine quality. the finish is full of the leafy fresh cut grass smell of european hops. on the tongue flavors of corn adjunct and alcoholic spiciness dominate up front. those flavors lead right into flavors of sulfur. those flavors combine in a way that isnt very flattering or enticing. flavors of soda cracker or baked bread are nonexistent. sugary sweetness provides an interesting through note adding just enough to the proceedings to give an unflattering illusion of white wine. bitter is crisp and bitter. its just not that good a beer. its almost as though the brewery took every thing people hate about lager and distilled them together into one product. red horse extra strongs only real redeeming feature is that its inexpensive and its strong. beyond id give this beer a hard pass.
3315,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.13,bought this at the local filipino market in a pint can four pack. pours a large foamy head but then dissipates quickly - clear golden color. aroma is very bready and malty not much else to speak of. taste is surprisingly light given the high abv. i would compare this to steel reserve - but the taste is lighter and a bit more bitter yet sweet at the same time. not a bad beer and worth a try if youre curious.
3316,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.62,a - pours a clear crystal lager colour with a white head that reduces quickly.  s - nothing of note except some small malt.  t - again nothing of note that is different to any other mass produced lager.  m - light body with medium carbonation  o - not worth the effort. this beer is just an ordinary lager with very little to warrant the extra layout.
3317,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.71,recently introduced to tjs (at least here in san diego) red horse is a smooth malt liquor clocking in at a stout 8.0 abv. similar to steel reserve in strength its a bit smoother and possibly akin to carlsberg elephant. good value at $4.49 for a four-back of 16.9 oz. talls all served up in a cool can with horseshoe and chess knight motif. to the reviewer who complained about the venerable trader carrying it? dont like it dont buy it wuss!
3318,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.18,extra strong crisp clean easy smooth to drink with little head that goes away and some carbanion to it overall a not bad beer when best served cold. at 8%
3319,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,4.48,funny how i am reading many of the ratings for red horse. the first time i tried this beer i knew i finally found something that i would truly enjoy. this is truly a situation of to each his own. i fell in love with red horse the flavour for me is outstanding. i love the higher alcohol content as well as the fact that it is not filling at least not to me. loved it the first time i tried it. not really a fan of lighter beers either. for me this beer is a keeper and i just recently tried hurricane and it is very similar. found another one that is a keeper for me. enjoy and drink responsibly.
3320,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,1,this is easily the worst beer ive had in my entire life. reeks of a high gravity like hurricane/steel reserve but this turned my stomach. bought this at a trader joes what the hell are they doing carrying something like this..?  lol this beer made my sick. im totally serious.....
3321,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.23,sunday may 15 2011 2:00 pm bottle poured to pint glass very cold beer sight: light pale yellow head a lot of lacing aroma: not a lot scent smell of malt nothing else taste: watery not a lot of taste mouth feel: very carbonated overall: good beer for the hot weather in the philippines and not to get drunk since it is soda the most inexpensive way
3322,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.75,finally an american malt liquor! i know its nothing to praise but still as many legends grew around this type of beer i just had to drink it. looks a bit darker and intense than a pale lager but somehow you can tell that its perhaps the coloring. the smell is also not that powerful and the taste also lacks the impression that makes a great beer - but it feels good to drink! as cheap as it is as poor as it is it is easy to drink and it is enjoyable. that being said i became even more interested in these malt liquors. looking forward to drinking mickeys fine malt liquor and that ol english 800!
3323,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.09,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours a deep brown color with a small head of light brown head. the head has a decent level of retention fading slowly over time and leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma of the brew is strong of a roasted malt and oaty smell mixed with some coffee and a bit of brown sugar. along with these smells comes notes of fudge and crème. other light notes of brown bread and caramel are there as well giving a dark and roasty smell overall. taste – the taste begins with a very roasty and toasty flavor mixed with lots of coffee and some nice oat flavors. other flavors of toast and roast as well as some caramel and cocoa are there as well. there is a bit of a brownie like flavor as well as some notes of nuttiness. toward the end the sweetness and roastiness increase a bit leaving one with a rather dark and roasty taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate carbonation. for the big rich flavors the feel is good and makes for a nice slow sipper. overall – a decent oatmeal stout nice for a cooler fall day. rich in flavor and very representative of the style.
3324,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.15,from a can from beer of the month. pours a thick dark brown with a sizeable head. you can smell the roasted malt and the taste is even more dominant. also a good bit of roasted chocolate. a very flavorful beer. i drank it side by side with a samuel smith oatmeal stout which is smoother with a vanilla sweetness. but ipswich held its own - and was its own version of stout.
3325,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,5,i gave a mixed review to a previous sample of this beer; it turns out that was an improperly-stored sample. this is my updated rave review for ipswich oatmeal stout:  this brew is black and viscous with an expansive lingering tan head.  the aroma is rich and earthy. something about the nose also makes me want to describe it as creamy.  the texture of the brew is creamy too. the carbonation level is perfect.  the beer abounds in delicious semisweet chocolate flavors. the finish is long with malt and hop flavors melding beautifully.  this is a glorious beer with some of the richness of an imperial stout but more drinkability. this is very possibly my favorite stout!
3326,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4,i am trying this beer off the tapper at the brewery as part of the classic four sample flight. it poured a dark opaque with nice tan cascading head that left a spotty lace. the scent had subtle malt and roast notes. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink. there was a subtle sweet roast and chocolate malt base with hints of coffee presence. the mouthfeel was smooth in body with good carbonation. overall it was a great beer.
3327,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.25,reminded of this beer by the how many beers of fame have you reviewed? post. i did not realize that i had not review this brew before. i have had this many times before looking forward to trying again.
3328,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.18,pitch black appearance with a large mocha colored head and lots of lacing; a real treat for the eyes. charred malt aroma with notes of coffee smoke and bittersweet chocolate. roasted malts rule the taste but sufficient hops help maintain a good balance. smooth full bodied mouthfeel that is nicely carbonated. dry bitter lingering finish. very enjoyable.
3329,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.02,very fine beer.  pours a very nice deep deep brown almost black. rich brown head.  no noticeable smell.  very smooth taste - full bodied and slightly sweet.
3330,Big Hazy,4,pours a hazy orange with a 1/2f head.  smells of citrus.  tastes of orange lemon apricot and pineapple with a barely bitter alcohol warm finish.  medium body with light carbonation. lightly lush syrupy mouthfeel.  this is a super juicy sipper of an ipa. i had this on draft and it was a bit watery and a bit unlike what i think of being a typical lfl brew. i hope i can a can to compare.
3331,Big Hazy,4.04,poured into a 13 oz tulip glass canned on 8/30/23. pours a cloudy orange with a solid finger sticky white head that thin streaks of lace with solid retention. 4.25  aroma really the orange steals the show grapefruit pineapple and apricot kind of a one trick pony but a good trick. 4  taste follows orange pineapple apricot and a little grapefruit in the finish. 4  mouthfeel is medium plenty of life not sticky or dry and at 9.2% the alcohol is well hidden. 4.25  overall this is nice and i can see me spending $17 a 4 pack when i see it fresh. nothing ground breaking but tasty. 4
3332,Big Hazy,3.94,look...a copper ale type with little to no haze. really do not consider this hazy but white fizzy head and moderate carbonation smell...dialed back orange smell with citrus abound more of a lemon to me.and light hop orange marmalade . hint of the grassy field taste....a tang of citrus off the front for sure biting juice with a bit of form leading it into bitter grapefruit. some balance of semisweet with a bitter significance in the drying finish that is resolute. the tang of the bite seems to make the abv nonexistent. feel...a slick and drinkeasy properties make it with a little lacing and a vibrant carbonation that lightens the filling. overall...this beer was a little too citrus dominant to me after the three four pack haha. i was loving this beer on the first one but dialed it back to very good. i tend to stay away from fruited beers but i get sucked in on a hot day. definitely worth a try because lawsons finest is worth a try pretty much always. salut cheers
3333,Big Hazy,4.15,true to lawsons this is a hazy dipa that is nowhere near a turbid murk bomb. instead its slightly cloudy but you can nearly read through it regardless. solid head production and retention.  on the nose its difficult to tell where the hop expression ends and the orange begins - in a good way. very complementary notes.  more bitter than most in the hazy crowd but dialed back perhaps a touch from the sunshine series. it also lacks some of the soft malt sweetness of the sunshine beers; ruby red grapefruit double sunshine is a natural comparison point but this beer while very good in its own right isn\t nearly as nuanced and delicious. there\s a nice slightly sour sharpness from the natural orange and lighter tropical and stone fruit notes adding to the citrus-forward mix.  supremely drinkable especially given the abv but it does drink much closer to a wc or traditional ipa than it does a hazy ipa.  overall this is frankly a delicious beer and very refreshing despite the monster abv. its nowhere near lawsons finest however (pun not intended) nor is it the best example of the style. lawsons has only fairly recently started chasing the ne ipa trend ironic considering they along with hf and the alchemist were the proto-ne ipas upon which the style emerged. sadly they dont chase trends nearly as well as they set them - but falling well shy of lawsons lofty heights results in a beer thats still really damn good.
3334,Big Hazy,4.05,16oz can dated under 2 weeks ago.  big pungent tangerine in the nose and palate. medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. finishes like a tangerine tonic. abv well hidden.
3335,Big Hazy,3.81,canned 11 days ago. i think the most impressive part of this is how drinkable it is given the abv -- its not weighed down by a syrupy malt character or teeth grating hoppiness. just a straightforward orange-backed dipa that definitely gives some of that sip of sunshine dank citrus hop candy character while also being unique. not the biggest fan of fruited ipas and this is no exception but my expectations were exceeded here  77/100
3336,Big Hazy,4.31,16 ounce can packaged 08/17/23.  moderate pour yields a one inch white head over a hazy light golden body with lacing.  nose of orange tropical fruit and other citrus with a bit of floral aromas as well.  taste is mostly orange with flavors of tropical fruit and other citrus with orange peel. sweet citrus pith bitterness is present through the finish.  nice fairly full mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  overall a great easy drinking dipa that hopefully will be put into lawsons year round lineup. go get yourself a 4-pack!!  cheers!!!
3337,Starry Noche,4.45,a - pours a syrupy thick deep dark brown with a ton of coconut floaties. no real head to speak of. heavy amount of sludgy lacing.  s - aroma is dark chocolate oak and huge barrel notes.  t - the taste is dark chocolate coconut hazelnut and tons of barrel.  m - full body with medium carbonation. syrupy thick mouthfeel with a slick drying finish.  o - top notch.
3338,Starry Noche,4.75,2022 version poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a snifter. this beer is wonderfully thick. probably the best toasted (coconut/hazelnut) flavor i recall having in quite some time.
3339,Starry Noche,4.9,#166 impressed!
3340,Starry Noche,4.54,big bold flavors. chocolate forward coconut is there as well plenty of barrel presence. slight thickness nothing oily or syrupy or slick at all. booze is subtle. really good.
3341,Starry Noche,4.28,thanks to texasfan549 for this 500ml bottle which looks like a medianoche work of art. split with no one. mine.  standard medianoche pour: dense black no head but hey this one has tiny flecks of coconut floating in it! always like that. nose meets expectations: dark deep malts coconut barrel. good.  starry noche is thick but you knew that. it’s full of raw coconut flavor but it says that right on the bottle. big sweet malts but hey imperial stout am i right? and barrels which is in smaller type amid a 121 word description of the beer: the bourbon is swinging low the rye is bringing a small dose of spiciness. nary a trace of booziness which is impressive & means that one/me could drink a full 500ml without blinking. i am still blinking. like a leaf tailed gecko.  one of the better of the pantheon. nothing subtle about this big bad stout. excellent brew.
3342,Ghost In The Laboratory,4,this was good but didn’t meet my expectations. this is a local brewery and love a bunch of their stuff. this beer is a legendary beer. i’m sure it’s amazing on tap but i haven’t had the opportunity to try it yet. looks like their was a bad batch that went around with a bunch of particulate. last batch i had was citrusy and dank? wasn’t amazing
3343,Ghost In The Laboratory,4.24,it was super hoppy almost like the hop resin was squeezed out of the buds and into the glass. it was very cloudy looking smelled and tasted like grapefruit sour orange juice lemon melon tropical fruit wet hops biscuit yeast a lot of herbal notes and heavy floral notes. it was viscous and each sip felt like there was chunks from the bottom of the can on my tongue. it was good but not as smooth as most beers by equilibrium.
3344,Ghost In The Laboratory,4.35,got a four pack of this beer this past weekend during a day trip to austin. the people at the beer shop were very nice!  poured from a can into a tulip glass. bright hazy yellow color with creamy off white head and good curtain lacing. bright citrus and tropical fruit smell and taste. pineapple orange and lime. was expecting a bit fuller smoother feel.nice hoppy finish. i really want to have this beer on tap.
3345,Ghost In The Laboratory,2.52,i expected a lot more from equlibrium and from a 95 rated world class dipa. it\s cloudy and filled with particulate not by itself a deal-breaker. it smells of green papaya and dank lemon. not my favorite but promising. but it tastes like orange juice left to ferment on its own in the back of your refridgerator. it\s overwhelmingly dank and pithy dry and bitter. not at all an enjoyable experience to my palate. this is the first dipa i\ve had that really gave me that sort of crushed up aspirin profile i\ve heard people talk about before. mouthfeel is fine but the texture is literally scrubbed away by intensely dry dank bitterness. if that\s your cup of well beer then be my guest but wow this is not for me.
3346,Ghost In The Laboratory,3.61,poured 1 week old crowler glug glug glug poured thickly with a creamy head that retreated quickly leaving a sudsy lacing. my nose ain’t working so today i don’t smell anything. taste guava melon dankness bitterness. not bad overall not stellar.
3347,Ghost In The Laboratory,4.46,16oz can. poured out a cloudy golden orange color with a good-sized off-white head of foam. it left sudsy trails of lace on the glass. it smelled of guava orange grapefruit caramel sweetness and resin. so much tropical fruitiness with toasted caramel & toffee. sharp bitterness.
3348,Bergenbier,2.29,premium pils? it seems all pils are premium in every single country in the world...  very bubbly head...quite shiny yellow colour.  refreshing light airy hoppy aroma typical of a budget pilsner.  not too sweet and quite refreshing. very well balanced. totally fine for a hot day when you just want something refreshing and lightly hoppy when you are chilling in the sun. light german style hops with a hint of czech. very light malt flavour coming through...  mouth feel is quite watery and tingly.  obviously this doesnt have the complexity of a west coast ipa from the west coast however as a budget pilsner its perfect. extra overall marks as its great value.
3349,Bergenbier,3,10 agosto 2020. de carrefour. en copa hefe de bavaria. tras partido de futbito y cena. pues no sé si será el calor tras jugar partido pero me la he fulminado en 0.1 y me ha parecido que tenía un perfil maltoso muy agradable ni aguado ni demasiado denso ideal para beber a grandes tragos y con una buena combinación de dulzor y amargor. avg 4.0  28 marzo 2022. en copa de pinta inglesa de ikea. estudiando. se bebe sin problemas y presenta ciertas notas agradables aunque nada que merezca la excesiva calificación que le di la otra vez. simplemente ok. avg 3.
3350,Bergenbier,2.33,they call this one a friendship maker. probably because when drunk you need to lean on someone.
3351,Bergenbier,2.95,bottled pours a clear light golden yellow colour with a absolute minimum head nickel coins and semolina aroma slight tang makes a slightly above average pils
3352,Bergenbier,2.89,very fresh and citrusy. tastey though.
3353,Bergenbier,2,robust head. the smell has nothing characteristic a little yeast. sour taste bitterness weak and thats it nothing fancy i see no reason to come back to it.
3354,Bergenbier,3.5,typical pale lager colour. great lacing.  mild aroma of grain.  taste is grainy and pleasantly well balanced with mild hop finish. very drinkable but with a very understated flavour.  overall a perfectly acceptable clean tasting lager with no off notes but slightly bland.  71/100
3355,Busch Ice,5,before i started my beer reviews earlier this year i had somewhat tongue-in-cheek declared busch ice as my favorite beer but busch ice being an excellent beer is no joke. the price the flavor the drinkability the abv heck even the way the can looks i love everything about this beer. one of my all time favorites.  style: ice lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 5.9% | rating: 5
3356,Busch Ice,3.1,when enjoying a beer it’s important to take price into account. this is not an outstanding beer—far from it. but it provides a decent amount of alcohol for a mainstream lager. it smells like alcohol and green apples. the taste is crisp but bland. mostly cereal grains with a faint hint of hops. aftertaste brings back that ethanol theme.  this is a beer to enjoy while getting buzzed or drunk and nothing more. it does what it’s supposed to do.
3357,Busch Ice,3.16,poured into a tulip (which was a mistake keep reading...) from deep chill fridge. can form factor.  a: very clear pale straw yellow. 2 mm stark white head shrinks to a thin ring and slight lacing.  s: typical cheap vomitous aal hops with a swish of banana ester in the background. not the strong point and the tulip concentrated it. eww.  t: actually not as gross as nose. keep it cold. use a koozie. if you do not do this it gets a little chalky as it warms. corn flakes. grainy. slight hint of less than carapils malt notes. hops are slight and maybe on the mildly earthy and a were tiny hint of herbal note that peeks at warmer temps. nothing too egregious but nothing too exciting.  m: creamy medium body that leaves some slick mouthfeel behind. nothing harsh at edge of tongue. very slight chalkiness at warmer temps.  o: i got this for an aggregate price of 55 cents a can and 5.9% abv. if i cut this with 50% water i get a beer equivalent to miller64 for about 27 cents per 12 oz beer equivalent. i cant touch miller64 for that price and any other beer in this range is far worse vomitious walrus piss. it has merit in this sense but not much else.
3358,Busch Ice,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included.
3359,Busch Ice,2.18,25oz can into a tall glass. my guess is it was canned sometime in march 2022 but thats only a guess.  looks very nice in a tall thin glass. crystal clear pale golden yellow body. big bright white head shrinks to a ring and covering excellent lacing.  unfortunately it smells like floral vomit.  the taste is smooth slightly sweet and malty clean. but it is also very thin and very watery with no real taste.  mouth between thin and medium finish watery and a little drying.  overall after the look this beer falls off a cliff. at least it was only 3 bucks.
3360,Busch Ice,3.43,its not the greatest beer in the world for sure but if you just finished mowing the yard it hits the spot or if youre short on the green then its the perfest brew. at $5.50 a six-pack 16 ounces ill take this over the hi-faluten-over-priced craft beer every day.
3361,Busch Ice,3,it’s definitely not awful. it’s not great or mind blowing but it’s a decent tasting lager that’s also really cheap. it’s very light straw clear decent white head with surprisingly good retention. smell is sweet malt and mineral water a hint of sulfur. tastes semisweet with a tart finish not exactly sour but tart. there’s a slightly sour aftertaste that i actually enjoyed. this sample is from a 16 oz can. i can’t say this would be my go-to beer but at $5.79 for a sixer of pints it’s for sure a good value for those on a budget. (i’ve been there before). the finish is crisp and semi dry. it also makes good michelada’s if you’re into those. there’s absolutely nothing better after you’ve been out working in some really hot weather. (start with 1 part clamato and 2 parts beer. add tabasco lime tajin even some orange juice. it doesn’t have to be precise. enjoy
3362,Busch Ice,3.34,anheuser-busch busch ice 25 fl. oz. can coded 22102 wa1009. sampled on 7 may 2022 $1.79 @ carools discount liquor merchantville nj  notes via stream of consciousness: it\s a good thing i bought the big one seeing as how this is rated awful on beeradvocate. ehh it was only $1.79 and i got to get \the eye\ for going into a store in camden nj that i damned well knew i shouldn\t be in. (i know i know it\s technically merchantville - i can\t figure out how that\s possible - but it\s a block away from what\s technically camden). what can i say i like the weirdo beers and malt liquors! it\s poured a clear straw gold body beneath a finger\s width of white foam. the head seems to be holding pretty well so it seems pretty good so far. the aroma is limited to a generic but clearly adjunct-enhanced beer. there are no real hops just a smear in the background. on the upside it\s clean but this isn\t a malt liquor it\s just 5.9% abv so i wouldn\t expect anything weird. on to the taste... it follows the aroma which is a good thing in that it\s clean but bad in that it\s fairly boring; t here is a little bit of an apple-like fruitiness to it though. it\s lightly sweetish and thus nicely balanced by a moderate bitterness and generic background hoppiness. the alcohol never shows but then again at 5.9% it shouldn\t although it is possible i assure you. it finishes mainly dry with a very short lingering finish. it\s basically the same beer from start to finish except that you get a little more malt upfront and the apple doesn\t step in until mid-palate. i\ve had worse european light lagers that have had more character to them but weren\t nearly as well made and then there\s the beers from the baltic region and russia that honestly seem like they\ve been brewed with anti-freeze. of course in parts of russia that could be a selling point - \whatever beer - keeps you from freezing!. so we\re basically done here. in the mouth it\s medium on the lighter side and gently crisp-then-smooth.
3363,Busch Ice,2.38,this one pours a watery looking golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells like sweet corn and grassiness and not much else.  this is certainly not good but its honestly not as a bad as i thought it could be. its not as skunky as it could be with just very little flavor to it overall - a mild sweetness and a decent crispness on the back end is about all i get.  this is light bodied mostly clean and very watery.  i expected this to be dumpster juice but its basically slightly sweet water that tastes like its been left out for a while.
3364,Busch Ice,2.15,12oz can - review from notes  this is like regular busch lite but with a shot of rotgut poured in. and you arent getting much more abv for how much worse this tastes  rusty headache water
3365,Busch Ice,1.56,i bought a can from the beerstore in ontario 473ml at 5.5%. my can was brewed by labatt brewing company in canada. it poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly evaporated and left a little lace but the taste was skunky not that enjoyable to me medium bitterness very slow carbonation. maybe the one brewed in the states is better but this is awful i must say . cheers.
3366,Busch Ice,4.09,this is the best ice beer in its class. all other ice beers bow to this one. it has the best taste of them as long as it is cold. of course there are better beers out there but for hot day after mowing the lawn this one is fine.
3367,Castle Lager,2.58,march 2004: (330 ml bottle). pale golden colour large thick head. fruity melon-like aroma flavour is typical industrial lager a bit sweet. not something im busy trying to sample again.
3368,Castle Lager,2.76,710 ml can into an imperial pint glass. straw/golen yellow w/soapy head smell of grains/rice/cereal taste is bland but not skunky thank goodness feel was light and watery yet crisp & refreshing on a hot day over all not great but better than most in its category. ba frustrates me with low scores of beers like this/the bros\ are too snooty for my taste lol.
3369,Castle Lager,2.51,a: the beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. it poured with a quarter finger high white head that died down but never completely faded away. s: light aromas of pale malts and skunk are present in the nose. t: the taste follows the smell and has a bit stronger but still light flavors of skunked pale malts. there is a faint amount of bitterness. m: it feels a bit more than light-bodied a bit smooth and rather clean on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. o: this beer is easy to drink and has a nice mouthfeel. it’s not that flavorful but the skunk in the smell and taste is rather minimal.  serving type: can
3370,Castle Lager,1.78,as a south african it pains me to concede how poor this beer is. growing up there was nothing better than an ice cold castle in a bottle on a hot day. now its taste ranges from awful to metallic to metallic corn awful. not sure if the recipe has changed or if mgmt has just let it fail.
3371,Castle Lager,2.63,a: pours a crystal clear pale yellow in color with moderate to heavy amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint pale golden yellow colored highlights. the beer has a finger tall sudsy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of slightly mottled very thin film covering a little more than 65% of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. light amounts of lacing are observed.  s: light to moderate aromas of grainy malts with a hint of rice + corn adjuncts and a light amount of grainy sweetness. hints of grassy hops.  t: upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of grainy malts with a hint of rice + corn adjuncts and a light amount of grainy sweetness. that is followed by very light flavors of grassy hops which impart a light to moderate amount of bitterness which slowly fades away.  m: slightly heavier than light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. crisp with a clean finish.  o: easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly crisp clean mouthfeel. similar to the big aals from american breweries not bad but not something that i would seek out again. would pair easily with foods and be refreshing in a very warm climate.
3372,Castle Lager,3,z01
3373,Castle Lager,4.92,castle lager is an excellent all around beer. it is your typical light lager but with just a touch of extra bitterness that makes the beer taste crisp and refreshing. its good for hot summer days at the beach and good for barbecues. its also a great beer after a hard days work no matter the season.
3374,Castle Lager,1.66,review: 330 ml bottle of castle lager: abv: 5% vol  nice brown bottle with a a logo of a castle go figure but nice all the same.  appearance is one of a clear golden colour with a white head that doesn’t stay around some small carbonation going on and overall the beer is not much to look at at all.  has a nice piercing smell of sweet corn and a lager type aroma very malty grainy and lemony. ok on the nose.  taste has nice warmish mouthfuls. not a strong initial taste and a bit flat. bit metallic in initial taste not nice and in overall taste as well. difficult to drink to be frank.  feck me this was a disgusting beer to drink. i felt a bit sick drinking it. it’s like a chemical infused beer with little thought given to flavours or tastes.  beer two. taste is very hoppy too hoppy too much sweet corn and all a bit sour hard to stomach especially for what is meant to be a lager. all in the front end. it’s a dead kind of taste. no too hoppy for me not nice.  very disappointing when you consider that sab have morphed into the worlds largest brewer of beers yet their baby castle beer is muck.
3375,Dead Guy Ale,3.79,pours a cloudy honey amber color with a decent head which dissipates quickly with almost no lacing. aroma is malt and yeast. taste is nice definitely malt with some nice bitterness and spicy follow up. feel is honey with some carbonation and sharpness. very nice. one of the few maibocks i’ve had.
3376,Dead Guy Ale,3.72,great maibock. mild flavor but well balanced. i’d describe it as a malty light ipa.  gorgeous color!
3377,Dead Guy Ale,3.4,pours a clear amber brief 0.5 head that rather quickly fizzles to a thin ring; no lacing. nose smells sweet of caramel honey and yeast esters; as it warms starts to resemble golden syrup with a little warming spice. taste is very honey forward - reminds me most of those honey straws you bite the ends of and chew down. spicy barley notes as well which give it some more savory notes that help prevent this from becoming too sweet. light bitterness comes through long on the finish. something about it reminds me of less sweet more hop-forward and spicy barleywines. mouthfeel is on the light side with crisp and slightly creamy carbonation.
3378,Dead Guy Ale,3.5,i drank it from a can poured into a goblet. color is light amber. there is almost no smell. malt dominates the taste as expected in a maibock. the sweetness is appropriately balanced with hops - although i would prefer more. i would rate it higher but i prefer a lighter bodied beer. overall - it is a a very good beer and is deserving of this rating.
3379,Dead Guy Ale,4.28,delicious. the flavors change as you drink it with a slightly bitter finish. great beer overall.
3380,Dead Guy Ale,3.35,from a 14 month old 16 oz. can. a cloudy shade of apricot with a cherry tint. minimal head which quickly disappears no lacing. taste is hard to quantify not much of anything stepping up. feel is medium cloying zero carbonation. overall i don’t think this may be a fair evaluation due to its age and i got it off the shelf.
3381,Dead Guy Ale,3.91,12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug.  l: hazy medium amber 2 finger manila colored head foam is rocky and persistent. s: big malty bread aroma orange tea honey. t: malty and medium sweet to open biscuit orange herbal tea bitter woody and light orange hops take over the back half aftertaste is woody with some malt sweetness. f: medium body medium carbonation soft and fairly clean feel. o: decent love the malty opening but find the back half a bit sharp for my palate.
3382,Clasica,2.81,440 ml bottle as mahou clásica original from super cor la manga. abv is 4.8%. golden colour pearly carbonation moderate white head. sweetish aroma both malts and hops are noticeable could be worse. soft carbonation in the mouth. the flavour has also noticeable malts the hops are moderate but for a spanish industrial lager this is not too bad at all.  earlier rating: 9/11/2011 total score: 1.8 330 ml can from super cor la manga. abv is 4.8%. golden colour low head. the aroma has some malts otherwise it is industrial and uninteresting. the flavour is maltier than the aliada tipo pilsen (which was displayed side by side) and there are some hops in the finish - unfortunately the bitterness is metallic and unpleasant.
3383,Clasica,3.48,on draft this really is a league better than its ratings and for me one of the better straight up lagers we had around spain of which we had a fair few. neat how every little region seemed to have its own as we traveled through i love the world of international yellow beer. this one seems cleaner than most super light bodied and kind of minimal sure but sometimes these are about what they arent not what they are and this isnt metallic oxidized cheap tasting adjunct heavy or sweet so its already ahead of many of its peers. it has a nice crispness even if the lager yeast has very little aroma or flavor and there is balance even if nobody would ever describe this as hoppy. i have grown to really appreciate freshness in these too and being close enough to the source for that to be the case was a treat. context can also be everything. we had this beachside on the mediterranean coast with some incredible seafood red mussels spicy shrimp it was primo so something yellow and cold and bubbly and non offensive was just right. i preferred this to a lot of others because of its tidiness and refreshment value. neat mineral profile makes it kind of earthy its very dry and it has some intangibles like head retention that a lot of these done. a pleasing pour had a couple of them stands up well to salinity in food and also to spice. better than it gets credit for here on ba.
3384,Clasica,2.2,bought at a bar in langreo (asturias) from tap. -pale looking. no foam head. -very few smell. -pilsner taste. but low. -carbonation felt  back to spanish reality from czech republic
3385,Clasica,2.58,330 ml bottle. pours golden with fluffy white head and lively carbonation. aroma is of grassy hops and grain. body is medium and crisp. taste is of grain and some hops. finish is medium and dry. ok on hot day.
3386,Clasica,2.41,pale straw color with thick lace. beyond that non-descript light beer.
3387,Clasica,1.79,cerveza de cuerpo ligero y carbonatación media. aroma a malta y poco más. en boca se siente la malta además de lúpulo y una pizca de caramelo. acuosa ligeramente amarga con un final extremadamente seco.
3388,Clasica,2.4,카스다 카스
3389,Death & Taxes,4.28,l: thiiiiiick two finger head with great lacing. walnut black body. s: malty roasty. light nuts a hint of cola and peanut brittle. t: roasty malt upfront quickly becoming piney hops with a lasting bitterness. flavors of nuts cocoa and unsweetened cola. the bitter pine needle flavors seem to build through the finish. f: smooth and creamy. o: i love black ipas and lagers and this is why. even hoppier than expected but still retains the lightness of a lager.
3390,Death & Taxes,4.4,canned may 8th purchased from bine and vine.  it pours black but with reddish hues nice 2 finger head of off white foam impressive lacing.  the smell is cocoa roasted malt coffee milk chocolate some hoppy notes of pine.  the taste is cocoa coffee a bit of smoke bitter notes of pine and dark chocolate.  smooth mouthfeel easy drinking a real joy just to sip on.
3391,Death & Taxes,4.48,brownish black opaque body with a full tan head and waves of lacing. aromas of brown bread yeast and roasted malt star dried dark fruit cocoa and slight pine poke through. in the taste an earthy yeast drives nice toast added to the roasted malt slight pine and faint chickory round out with deep kisses of cocoa and date. the feel is exceptional: dry and roast meets frothy breadiness in a darker setting smooth and light without ever being thinned out. bravo!
3392,Death & Taxes,4.44,this is an absolutely amazing dark lager and i would be drinking it no stop if it was sold in my area. dry bitter yet balanced and with an amazing mouthfeel for a lager. what a delicious brew.
3393,Death & Taxes,4.34,smells like a chocolate biscotti in a glass. tastes like a chocolate biscotti in a glass. really delicious! full of chocolate coffee toasted biscuit earthy hops a little honey sweetness very mild roasted bitterness and a clean finish. crisp carbonation and a light-medium body is perfect for the drinkability. did i mention this is delicious? i usually go for all the ales all the time but this lager is great! well done moonlight!
3394,Death & Taxes,4.22,look: dark brown with a dark cream head  smell: very malt heavy little bit of bread hint of chocolate  taste: very malty nice bread and chocolate notes  feel: smooth
3395,Death & Taxes,4.88,a expensive beer for me thats worth the price...
3396,Death & Taxes,4.25,dark brown pour that appears black in the glass; huge frothy and long lasting tan colored head. fantastic aroma of coffee and dark roasted grains; notes of cocoa and light milk chocolate. the taste picks up from the aroma; sweeter more chocolate flavor infused with a nice coffee bitterness. medium-light body; a nice bit of mildly phenol dryness offsetting the residual sugar feel.  this absolutely beautiful beer is a sheer joy to drink. rich malty yet amazingly smooth and easy drinking.  pouring temperature: 45 °f; canning info: 09/23/2022 source: @dimidiata (nbs bif #16)
3397,Death & Taxes,4.35,pours black with a hint of brown and a khaki creamy head that lingers and leaves good lacing. nose is dominated by roasted malts expressing themselves as charred coffee and chocolate with a hint of smoke. the taste follows the nose with roasted malts dominating with notes of charred tobacco chocolate and coffee. earthy hops are present as well and provide a nice balance for the malts. each drink invites another sip. the mouthfeel is excellent -- its soft and creamy while remaining light and drinkable. overall very good to excellent.
3398,Death & Taxes,4.25,16oz. can served in a willibecker. pours one shade shy of black with a creamy one-finger khaki-colored head that dissipates towards the edges leaving a soapy slick across the surface. nose is lovely - cocoa roast and a hint of char. taste follows nose with a char and a bitterness that lingers at the end. mouthfeel is light in body with an assertive carbonation. overall a lovely dark lager.
3399,Death & Taxes,4.32,16 oz. can. black body. big khaki head. smells of strong roasted malt: coffee tobacco light smokey char. tastes of strong roasted malt as well. bitter chocolate coffee burnt wood with the slightest hint of malty sweetness. just when you expect it to be malty and sweet it drops off in body leaving a pleasant roasted malt bitterness. light body exceptionally flavorful. delicious expression of dark roasted malt.
3400,Liberty Ale,3.5,as always my caveat: i rate the way i do on untappd.  i was able to snag an anchor variety pack that has steam california lager tropical haze and liberty ale.  as i understand beer history this was one of the first craft ipas released. it\s a good beer but unfortunately by today\s standards it\s barely a pale ale. edited to add: according to anchor\s own web site: now known as the first american pale ale and the beer that started the ipa movement.  poured into my sam adams glass deep gold. its got a little bit of malt character and a decent amount of hop bitterness but this beer gets lost in the competition. theres nothing really remarkable about it.
3401,Liberty Ale,3.75,i had this on draft 6/21/23 @ the hopleaf.  see-through orange appearance.  small white head; nice lacing remained.  grapefruit peel & mild artisanal soap notes in the nose.  medium mouthfeel.  grapefruit peel & artisanal soap flavors.  solid if unremarkable.
3402,Liberty Ale,3.49,its to be respected for what it is but its not what it was anymore. even from 10 years ago its not the same quality as it used to be. i thought that it was just their branding that changed but apparently not. too bad too it was a classic ale!
3403,Liberty Ale,3.91,>bias alert< im not a big fan of west coast ipas. some are good. most arent.  now to the liberty ale!  poured a beautiful color of a polished piece of amber. lots of bubbles. head stuck around for 5+ minutes. nice lacing! taste is strictly that cascade hops taste not too bold but just enough to get that bitter mouthfeel. nice carbonation! not much of a lingering bitter aftertaste like ive experienced with some beers (rebel rouser ranger ipa torpedo). definitely a nice refreshing brew.  overall i think its a great beer for a hot day or a nice drawn out bbq.
3404,Miles To Go Before I Sleep,4.65,poured into a 13 oz teku glass says canned spring of 2023. pours midnight black with 2 plus finger sticky mocha head that leaves a thin wall of lace with excellent retention. 4.75  aroma is peanut butter cup cocoa coffee milk oreo caramel and toffee. 4.75  taste follows peanut butter and chocolate dominates with some roasted coffee caramel toffee and vanilla bean. 4.75  mouthfeel is above average not sticky or dry soft gentle carbonation and 9.1% abv it goes down extremely easy. 4.25  overall this is a very tasty stout i still wish it had a little bigger body but still really impressive. 4.5
3405,XTRA DUBL Benthic,4.74,2021 vintage. opened first within a couple months of release.  this is really fantastic but so is regular benthic (2021) specifically and especially when fresh. lots of coconut but not in the pastry territory of something like coconut vibes. coffee is still present but balanced by the coconut. mouthfeel is on point.  i tried to rate this for what it is not whether or not i felt a little let down - which i did. i had expectations that it would be a little more coconut forward. in fact im not sure it is truly that much different than regular benthic but that doesnt make it any less delicious. it just didnt quite meet the expectation i set for it.
3406,King Julius,5,excellent
3407,King Julius,4.62,a - pours a hazy orange with a one finger creamy white head. heavy amount of soapy lacing.  s - aroma is orange mango and pineapple.  t - the taste follows the aroma with orange juice pineapple mango cantaloupe and a light bitterness in the finish.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. creamy mouthfeel with a soft crisp finish.  o - this is a top notch neipa.
3408,King Julius,4.85,l: a yellow gold which poured with two fingers of white head. extremely hazy.  s: pineapple some mango orange zest.  t: follows nose with a bit less pineapple. a little bitterness on the back end.  f: moderate carbonation medium to full body.  o: an absolute masterpiece. no wonder its rated so highly.
3409,King Julius,4.48,pours a dark orange totally opaque. small head that disappears quickly but with good lacing. nose is faint mangos taste is a soft mango and peach with some bitterness. i liked this better than fresh julius. a good hazy better than most but not so amazing you should drive 400 miles. i enjoyed tree house but its annoying you have to pay for full pours and cant pay to try several things and see what you like.
3410,New,1.82,375ml pull-tab can from bottle mart port douglas australia.  insipid with a cheap malt taste at its core (6-row would be my guess) and some odd vague breadiness/doughiness towards the finish. in short its pretty bad but it isnt syrupy or watery so i suppose its drinkable. in any case i reckon going off memory its the worst australian beer ive tried to date.  d- / not recommended
3411,New,1.44,terrible but a bit less terrible than crown lager. not much else to really say. its mega dry and seems to have been pasteurized for at least 1 year maybe more
3412,New,2.4,tooheys new. the pride of new south wales. another mainstream aussie adjunct lager its a nsw icon much like vb is to victoria xxxx queensland emu export to wa and west end to sa. its not something ive had in a while as previously i found it too sweet for my liking. but lets give it a fair crack...  look: standard aussie macro lager. deep golden straw filtered highly carbonated. head was non existent and has faded to a thin foam on top. lots of cascading bubbles rising to the top. standard stuff.  smell: wet grassy hops from the standard pride of ringwood hops which also gives a slight sour lemon/citrus nose pale malt sweetness. smells like an aussie adjunct lager  taste: heavy biscuit malt and grain flavour throughout the sip a tiny fizz of bitterness towards the end with a slight citrus twang. pretty clean and smooth. carbonation is heavy and takes over the flavour of the beer quickly.  feel: highly carbonated so refreshing when drunk ice cold. its clean easy drinking especially if youre just after something to drink without thinking about complex flavours.  overall: its better than what i remember from my young adult days of drinking this stuff because it was one of the cheaper options on the market but its pretty bland to be honest. theres not a lot going on flavour profile wise and the heavy carbonation does not assist in keeping the flavours around. having said that you need to drink this ice cold - much like vb as once it warms up it starts to turn proper funky. a decent enough lager to quaff quickly on a hot summers day
3413,New,2.91,pours pale golden with plenty of carbonation rising. decent 1 finger head that has good lasting power.  aroma of corn light malt and slightly bready.  taste is of light malt corn and somewhat grassy. rather sweet. tastes better than expected (expectations were low).  mouthfeel is light body and lightly cleansing. somewhat dry in the mouth.  overall a decent hot weather beer. maybe slightly better for the style than most. still nothing to get too excited about.
3414,New,3,gold in color with a half inch of off white covering the top. the aroma is of corn and that’s it. i’m tasting some corn and light malt. there’s a trace of grassy hops. the mouth is highly quaffable and thin.
3415,New,3.25,from can pours amber with thin white head which fades away very quickly. aroma of grain hops. taste is some malts and a little hop bitterness. not to bad.
3416,New,1,horrible!
3417,New,1.41,curious lack of any destinct flavor.
3418,New,2.57,grainy this is worth a try
3419,Schaarbeekse Kriek,3.77,this is a great fruited lambic for those who like it sour. the combination of the tart schaarbeekse variety of cherries on top of the already tart 3f lambic base make for an experience that for me veered somewhat into acetic territory. very clean however which was nice  76/100
3420,Schaarbeekse Kriek,4.83,blend #61 2020/2021 season. absolutely phenomenal. an all-night sipper. the depth and intensity of the cherries is absolutely amazing. rivals the lou pepe kriek for the best kriek i’ve ever had.
3421,Schaarbeekse Kriek,4.5,2019.
3422,Schaarbeekse Kriek,4.35,2022-07-16 750ml corked/caged bottle served in a tulip. bottling date 08/26/2020. bought it earlier today at chucks hop shop seward park. it was expensive.  pours a dark purplish red with a small to nonexistent head -- a thin white ring around the glass with sparse carbonation. fairly hazy. smell is rich berry jam and oaky acid tartness.  taste is similar -- rich berry jam more on the oak and less on the acid almost a funk to it and something that hints at a butteriness not diacetyl but something that just makes it seem fuller and richer. moderate fruit skin bitterness characteristic.  mouthfeel is medium bodied very dry. overall this is a very good beer.
3423,Dortmunder Gold,4.38,sampling a 12 oz bottle poured into my .5l dimple mug at cellar temp. 6/17/2023 date stamp on the label. the beer pours a clear copper color with a few lazy streams of carbonation rising to the surface. there is a foaming soft eggshell white head of 2 cm. this foam fades quickly to a thin edge layer and leaves very scattered lattice when i take a sip or swirl the mug. aroma is a big of caramel and toasted bread with hints of biscuit as well. i do get some spicy hops and maybe tea note as well. overall the nose is kind of mild but also complex. first sip reveals a light to medium body with smooth texture and gentle carbonation. very easy drinker as would be expected for the beer and this style. flavor is toasted grains and biscuity malt with some spicy hop and black tea again this lingers briefly after the swallow. a nice easy drinking yet flavorful beer. glad to have finally posted this review!
3424,Dortmunder Gold,4.21,on tap at great lakes  while visiting cleveland for my first time i couldn’t pasa up the opportunity to come to the legendary great lakes. and naturally i had to start off with the world’s highest rated dortmunder lager. let’s see what it’s all about  pours a mostly clear copper gold with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is gentle but very well balanced. i’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt earthy hops black tea black pepper toffee light honey and raw grain  and it’s very similar in taste but that’s fine by me. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting bready malt black tea herbal hops toffee raw grain and light white pepper. the swallow brings notes of biscuity malt herbal hops toffee black tea black pepper raw grain and light orange zest  a light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth and crisp beer. finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness  this is damn solid. i haven’t had a dortmunder in a while so i’m goad to have this one of all of them
3425,Dortmunder Gold,3.44,great looking beer with little head staying power is about the best i can say about this brew. now its not that the rest of it was bad it was just mostly also-ran. i just found it to be a bit metallic tasting and the smell was just not there. still a decent brew not one i will go out of my way for.
3426,Dortmunder Gold,4.1,pours a crystal-clear amber/gold with a thick white cap. nice lacing. aroma is roasted malt biscuit grassy hops. flavor follows the nose sweet up front with a bit of noble hop bitterness in the finish. feel is medium bodied with good carbonation. overall a fantastic beer.
3427,Dortmunder Gold,3.84,5/1/23 ford from a 12 oz can purchased from the washington beer store.  very little lacing or much head.  aroma is sweet malt right up front. slight citrus as well.  taste is definitely lager. sweet. cracker. dry hoppiness comes through.
3428,Dortmunder Gold,4.32,poured into a stein from a 12-oz can well within its date range.  appearance: dark golden with a massive off-white head that dissipated gradually leaving nice lacing.  nose: pleasant toasted malt.  mouthfeel: medium which was pleasantly heavier than i’d anticipated.  attack: plenty of malt balanced with hop bitterness.  finish: hop bitterness lingers but doesn’t approach astringency.  this fine lager deserves every bit of its many awards and its #1 ranking in its style. true to style heavier and more flavor intense than many lagers.
3429,Dortmunder Gold,4.43,pours a crystal-clear gold with a foamy white head and good lacing. very bright herbal and hay like aroma toasty cracker and sweet bread dough. the taste is spicy herbal and fresh with a toasty/bready malt backbone moderate body and clean drying finish. very flavorful and quaffable. i dont really know exactly what a dortmunder-style lager is supposed to taste like but this is world-class beer.
3430,Colt 45 Strong Beer,1,while i am not aware of the legal classification that governments what is or isnt a malt liquor but i am sure the guidelines are not very strict.  the aroma is a pungent sugary sweet corn scent mixed with a malty dank alcoholic warmth. from the first sip you will realize that is marketed as less of a beverage and more of a means to reach intoxication. sugary cereal mixed with corn make up the body then hot gross sweetness like you get acid reflux.  smells almost like rubbing alcohol. tastes like the surgeon generals warning. unless you are on very hard times and someone has offered you this for free please avoid this and stop buying this. this is no good reason why this is produced. far worse than olde english just a note/ reference point.
3431,Colt 45 Strong Beer,2.78,710ml can (a seven ten apparently) - i have my reasons which are essentially along the lines of pouring one out for a friends dog - rest in puppy peace czar!  this beer pours a clear bright medium golden yellow colour with four fingers of puffy finely foamy and only faintly fizzy off-white head which leaves some random splotchy lace around the glass as it slowly and evenly abates.  it smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt dextrose corn pops white grape juice and rubbing alcohol. the taste is bready and doughy er malt simple syrup white wine dregs the water in which you boiled the corn sugary booze and some ethereal earthy and dead floral bitterness.  the carbonation is pretty unremarkable in its milquetoast frothiness the body a solid middleweight and actually fairly smooth with only the firewater essence maybe acting as the fly in the proverbial ointment to wit. it finishes off-dry the generic malt and muted frooty notes fixing for a lingering donnybrook.  overall - yeppers this is exactly what the doctor (a known quack but still) ordered and actually quite tolerable when fridge-cold. however the honeymoon fades fast as things start to warm so id say that puts this one smack dab dead center in the bullseye of this style amirite?
3432,Colt 45 Strong Beer,1.5,first sips its bad. a few sips later its so bad its good. after a few more its so so-bad-its-good that it circles right back round to plain bad again.
3433,Indian Brown Ale,4.08,innovative hybrid style part robust porter part ipa all brown ale. deep chocolate brown with a frothy pale tan head of sticky foam. aroma is brown sugar and leather chocolate malted milk and whiff of phenolic esters. flavor is robust for a brown ale and firmly bittered but not ipa ibus full of dark and caramel grain character. medium plus body with great balance of sweet and herb bite though a little bit cloying as it warms. this reminds me of ubu ale and turbo dog but bigger and better - with a hint of kick ass brown hopiness. like most dfh beers unique off-style and memorable.
3434,Indian Brown Ale,4,first time i had ever seen this style...really good! no joke i could taste a stout an ipa (not a lot but some distinctive hops) and a good brown ale. mostly the first and last but it wasnt entirely one if the aforementioned styles. i really enjoyed it
3435,Ruination IPA,4.39,bottle to pint glass.. done with fruity little hazies? ready to get back to what made you dig ipas in the first place? here’s your golden ticket back to hop city. dank and stanky and crisp and lively! drink this!
3436,Ruination IPA,4.46,a little light on the look and feel but overall a very solid west coast double ipa. on the side of bitter and bright not buttery whatsoever not floral not caramel not citrus just straight up west coast imperial ipa crisp and dry. dank.
3437,Ruination IPA,4.38,l - bright golden with great clarity and a white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a thin cap and some lacing s - bright floral hops faint bubblegum citrus. smells somewhat faint t - bright resinous piney hops up front and throughout intermixed well with floral notes citrus some biscuit and hints of bubblegum f - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. crisp and refreshing o - beautifully simple. the og west coast dipa
3438,Ruination IPA,5,the classic recipe delivers the double ipa that solidified my love of the double ipa. overall a perfect representation of the style. everything you want for the style including a rich amber color hop forward flavor perfect malt backbone and a bitter finish to deliver an amazing beer. stone got it right with this recipe and i am glad they brought it back to celebrate.
3439,Ruination IPA,4.47,one of my old favorites in early 2010s.  a- pours a golden copper color. leans on the transparent side but this allows the incredible bubbles rising to be seen clearer. thick fluffy head that sticks around. gorgeous  s- bitter oily pine floral undertones.  t- lots and lots of pine honey delightfully bitter. resin some grassy character in the finish.  m-full bodied with a bitter aftertaste.  o- a phenomenal old school ipa that spits in the face of current trends. love it
3440,Ruination IPA,4.5,look - aggressive pour with nice foamy white head color is clear and copper good lacing throughout. smell - grapefruit floral taste - sweet malt caramel citrus pith tangerine spice dank hops resin. big medium body with bitter carbonation that simmers to a soft dry finish on the top of the tongue. overall very enjoyable a few 4 packs upon release but im more a fresh jai alai or tropicalia kinda guy.
3441,Ruination IPA,4.32,from a 12oz can dated packaged 12/27/22 best by 4/26/23 into a pint glass.  pours a translucent golden orange with about one finger of white head. excellent retention and lacing.  smells pretty much exclusively of pine. some light notes of dirt and grass.  taste follows. pine. pine. pine. bitter pine.  sticky mouthfeel with a strong long lasting bitter aftertaste. medium carbonation.  this beer is as advertised and it\s wonderful. never had the og so the wonderfulness of this beer is as-is no comparisons necessary.
3442,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.66,wow.  absolutely one of the most insane heads ive seen on a really cold stout. the head of three fingers just sat there. bubbly beautiful light brown. the beer a much darker brown but not too dark.  not much on the nose.  delicious. smooth creamy a lot of good flavors nothing overpowering.  great beer.
3443,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.13,12 fl oz can served in a pokal glass  this beer pours black and is topped with a minimal tan head.  i smell coffee anise chocolate and vanilla.  the taste starts sweet with cocoa and vanilla. i get some anise in the middle with black coffee. it finishes sweet again with the initial flavors.  full bodied with a smooth mouthfeel  solid beer. i cant believe it took me so long to try it.
3444,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.17,a very good ris!!! poured from a 12oz. can into a snifter this beer featured a dense brown color and a surprisingly big frothy light tan/cream color head. head retention was excellent for this strong a beer. minimal lacing on the glass. aroma and taste feature a rich slightly sweet maltiness with lots of coffee and some chocolate in the flavor. mouthfeel was rich and smooth with a little alcohol warming but no harshness.this is one of the better ris style beers i have had!!
3445,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.18,april 2023.athens.
3446,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.24,on tap at the beer station in sc.  this near black stout has a very full body. lots of chocolate in the nose and lingering chocolate notes in the aftertaste. rich flavor.
3447,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.01,12oz can from tavour. near black pour barely there beige head. subtle aroma roast malts light chocolate. taste brings subtle sweetness dark chocolate cocoa. creamy feel smooth. not a lot of the abv is apparent. basic impy stout executed perfectly.
3448,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.21,12 ounce can dating is smudged so i cant tell when this was canned. served in a snifter the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch or so tan head that stayed around a while. theres also a lot of lacing. aroma is nice the brew smells like dark chocolate roasted malt coffee and molasses. taste is pretty much just like the aroma but theres also some dark fruit licorice and burnt/charred malt flavors noticeable too. mouthfeel/body is medium/full its coating and has a moderate amount of carbonation. i thought this was an enjoyable enough imperial stout i liked it!
3449,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.81,4 pack purchased from wegmans on 9/12/22. poured from a 12 oz can into a stemless goblet.  l- pitch black.  s- deep roasted aroma molasses.  t- smooth rich almost coffee like flavor.  f- silky smooth rich almost toffee like flavor.  o- a fantastic and approachable russian imperial stout!
3450,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.17,pours a glossy black with ample mocha foam that leaves lacing on the glass. the taste is heavy on the malts with a sweet molasses taste and an undertone of coffee and light bourbon barrel oak. it is less heavy on char and more heavy on cola sweetness and that kind of chocolate flavor that the malt imparts. however some roasted malts poke through on the aftertaste and strangely makes my throat tingle. the feel is medium and carbonation is fine.
3451,Insanity,4.3,12 oz bottle brewed on: 11/11/16 best before: 11/11/21 date consumed: 04 feb 2023 glass: snifter abv: 11.1%   look: opaque chestnut brown crowned with a half-finger tan head. the head settles to a ring of tan lace.  aroma: rich and sweet maltiness. caramel. toffee. brown sugar. stone fruits especially cherry. noticeable notes of oak and bourbon whiskey (vanilla the aforementioned cherry and brown sugar some coconut wood touch of baking spice).  taste: all of the notes from the aroma are here. the caramel toffee and brown sugar and cherry (dark/black cherry) are more prominent in the taste than in the aroma. as is the coconut though not as much. the alcohol can be noticed and provides nice mild but warming burn (which isnt surprising). the sip finishes warm and semi-dry.  feel: creamy and a tad sticky. there is a nice warmth from the alcohol. the body is medium.  overall: a complex and enjoyable barleywine of the english persuasion. this beer is drinking nicely at 6.25 years old (and 1.25 years past its best by date) and makes quite the nice winter time sipper.
3452,Insanity,3.5,big carb for a barleywine poured it and retaining some head 12/30/14 12/30/19 date code on label poured seemed eh a little thin but let’s get into this. appreciated inside a rona 360 ml celebration wine glass  nose is bad mildewy leather cardboard taste is better pruney raisin thinner than id like leathery old flavor marginal barrel i guess this fucker is pretty old and perhaps past it’s prime assuming it’s a 2014 release? so 8 years old in that case let’s try to be nice. prune raisin thin body decent sugars pretty nice so it’s not bad but it’s not that good. i think you’ll need to take into account the extended age of this one. assuming the body hasn’t changed since inception id appreciate a slightly thicker feel but can’t complain too much there is a noticeable viscosity. 3.9/10
3453,Insanity,4.24,caramel color with a 1f head. the look is the only weaker aspect of the beer. strong oak in the aroma very smooth mf especially for the style and very smooth. the taste mirrors the aroma with some added fruit. an excellent barleywine. more balanced than bigfoot and other beers in the style.
3454,Insanity,4.17,pours a nearly clear dark chestnut color with a small head and light lacing.  smells of bourbon oak and dark fruit.  tastes of sweet malt raisins caramel and vanilla with a warm boozy finish.  medium heavy body with very light carbonation. lush syrupy mouthfeel.  this is one of the sweetest barleywines i have ever tasted.
3455,Insanity,4.44,pours the most gorgeous brown color you’ve ever seen a little hazy with a light tan head that sticks around a bit. absolutely beautiful beer. the nose is rich with caramel and toffee notes and there’s a nice oaky aroma from the barrel - and of course the stone fruit.  the stone fruit is the key to this and the base beer (blithering idiot). i am literally salivating.  the caramel and toffee flavors are forward on the taste as they should be and there’s a delicious oaky flavor from the barrel which also provides a bit of alcohol heat which fits this big beer (13.3% abv) perfectly but it’s that stone fruit that reels me in - the dark cherry flavor is the perfect complement to the aforementioned components. i could drink gallons of this.  the mouthfeel is substantial and a bit creamy. i loved the base beer and i love this variant a smidge more.
3456,Insanity,4.35,very oaky barrel. good carbonation. balanced between american and english style to my palate.
3457,Insanity,4.41,aggressive pour yields more head (with more staying power) than anticipated. a pretty solid ring of lace forms as it slowly recedes. body is a murky doo doo water brown. the label says that this was aged in oak barrels but it\s pretty clear from the smell wafting into my nostrils that those barrels once contained whisky. and so too does this beer. lots of it. not picking up the usual barrel char notes that these bourbon barrel aged beers often lend; this is just neat straight-up whisky. the base beer offers up some caramel notes and bitter hops and i\m getting rather excited that this is a proper barleywine and not just a triple ipa. *sips* oh it is! malty sweet caramel up front with drying whisky to balance things on the back end. very very nice. soft sugar daddy caramel lingers on the palette. pretty well full-bodied with proper chew. mild bittering. i really like this one. it\s a little cold (left it in the fridge overnight) but i\m going to sip slowly and let it warm to see if it opens up any hidden complexities. something tells me it will.
3458,Insanity,4.38,poured a 12 ounce bottle of undetermined date (wtf weyerbacher?) into a lost abbey long stemmed tulip. thick off white head over a clear brownish ruby color. smell was muted at cellar temperature but eventually warmed up and reflected malty dark fruit notes and brown sugar. taste reflected the smell but more immediate and intense. mouthfeel was deceivingly light for an ale of this heft.  for some reason (again wtf weyerbacher with no data on the bottle) i was expecting this to be an american style barleywine not having access to ba at the bottle shop (or being too lazy to look it up) so only bought a single. its still not nearly as complex as jw lees harvest ale or thomas hardy but perhaps aging can help that. maybe not but this is too good not to experiment with.
3459,Insanity,4.85,excellent beer. if you are a fan of bourbon you will enjoy the added whiskey dimension. smooth little sweet but excellent.
3460,Porter,4.5,a dry crisp and hoppy rendition of the style. the aroma is very complex with roasted coffee dark crusty bread and burnt sugar notes being complimented with a substantial herbal and spicy hop character. the taste has more of the same with a spicy bittersweet chocolate finish. a very unique drinking experience by todays standards with the style moving away from bitter flavors and more into sweet flavors in most examples. too bad this one is not widely available these days this is classic west-coast beer at its best.
3461,Porter,3.68,draught pint at the brass tap here in baltimore
3462,Porter,3.83,oxblood with a thin ribbon of off white foam; cocoa powder brown bread and salted peanuts on the nose; salted caramel brown toast hazelnuts chicory coffee kola nut + slight licorice light twiggy hopping to end; light clean salty tightening bitterness.  3.75 3.75 3.75 4 4  dec 30 ‘20 bottling date - 6 months old. much more like an english brown porter (aside from the bitterness) than most american porters. roasty notes are low in favor of nutty bready malts. there’s also a thread of that chico yeastiness throughout. what saves it is the body: light and fizzy enough to be sessionable but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying.  a solid beer but get edmund fitzgerald for that classic american porter profile.  lighter fizzier sweeter nuttier more balanced less hoppy cleaner and more sessionable than sierra nevada stout.
3463,Porter,3.89,12 oz. bottle dated 6/18/20  clear translucent brown ale with two fingers fine tan head. full head and lacing. roast malt gingerbread earthy yeast aromas explode out of the bottle. nutty sweet roast malt light hop kick light char coffee flavors deepening as the glass warms. a yeast flavor that i seem to experience in a number of sierra nevada beers. light hop bitterness medium feel lasting carbonation substantial depth of flavors in a 5 % abv ale. very pleasant.
3464,Porter,3.71,nice roasty malt up front with some sweet earthiness mixed in. it has a light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation and a mild bitter end. the finish drops off quickly - too quickly actually. it really is a nice porter but overall its too light could be so much more.
3465,Porter,3.47,pours a dark coffee brown ruby hues and a creamy tan head. aromas are fairly muted a roasted malt profile is there but i can’t really pick anything definitive. flavors include roasty malt notes of coffee raw cocoa and earthy nuttiness. trademark sn floral hop bite makes a subtle appearance on the back end. mild carbonation. lingering bitterness on the palate.  it’s good for sure not extraordinary or anything. as with any beer freshness is everything. i would love to get some of this closer to the source to see the contrast in the flavors.
3466,Porter,4,pours dark with a coffee note to it. little head with a little light that gets through. chocolate coffee flavors upfront sweet finish.
3467,Porter,3.21,had this one in a blind taste test recently with 3 other porters and it just did not stack up. the look was different the carbonation was different the taste was bland in comparison. not as good as i remembered.
3468,Porter,4.1,look: dark brown almost black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light with a frothy light tan head that settles slowly leaving good lacing aroma: roasted barley chocolate notes toasted nuts warm brown bread and some earthiness taste: roast is the highlighted theme here. tons of roasted barley nuttiness and even a light roasted coffee bean note hit hard up front and as those begin to subside chocolate joins the mix. more roast goodness and earthy notes take hold and lead to the finish mouthfeel: full bodied smooth medium-high carbonation and smooth but slightly sharp on the finish from either the earthy hops or strong roast notes overall: this is tasty stuff. i hadn’t had this beer in almost two years as only one spot close to me has it in so when i saw bottles dated 10/9/20 i had to revisit and glad i did. a very well-made american porter with deep and rich malt flavors and enough earthy hops to keep it balanced. throw in the very full body on this as well and you have yourself a winner. a classic and delicious to boot
3469,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,5,it has been 29 years since i had the last taste of this beer but i remember it like it was yesterday. when i first tasted it i thought at the time it was the best beer i had ever had up to that point and after all these year it is still the best beer i have ever had. while i was stationed in germany i spent many many marks on this beer best money i ever spent!!! been around the globe and have drank countless different beers from many different countries and i have not found a beer that i enjoy more that this one. the color of this beer is warm and relaxing the feel of the beer is smooth and silky not watery or thick the smell is somewhat sweet caramelly and the taste is a little sweet although not sugary sweet mellow leaving a very pleasant aftertaste that slowly fades away.
3470,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.95,the absolute best beer i ever had the opportunity to have. my portfolio of beers have 687 different beers of all styles. i wish i could get this in the states.
3471,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.42,16.60 euros for the one liter growler and one liter of beer at the kloster. reviewed 10/23/18. capped bottle marked “mindestens haltbar bis 24.04.19” on the front label. pre-filled and stored in a reefer at the kloster. stored on my window sill at 51 degrees and consumed at the same temperature from a hand washed and dried glass coffee mug. appearance – 4. body – medium amber clear. head – large (maximum 4.5 cm aggressive center pour) off-white creamy good retention diminishing to a three mm ring and complete layer. lacing – very good – multiple partial rings of tiny bubbles some connected by columns and some having stalactites. first pour – medium amber hazy. aroma – 4.5 - caramel malt. flavor – 4.5 - less caramel and more malt than the nose. slightly sweet. no hops no alcohol (4.9 % abv) no diacetyl no dimethylsulfide. palate – 4 – less than medium creamy soft carbonation. impression and interpretation – 4.5 – an excellent dunkel possibly the best i’ve ever had! i’d had it vom fass while visiting and attempted to buy one of the fascinating 1 liter growlers as a souvenir – imagine my joy when i found it came filled with beer!
3472,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.66,i drank it on a trip to the monastery when staitioned in fulda for the 4/11th acr it was one of the best drunkel beirs ive ever drank love it...
3473,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.85,my very favorite bier! i\ve only drunk this brew at the monastery. the bier itself is worth a trip. i was stationed about an hour away from there when i was with the 11th cavalry and i have had many day-trips there for great times with friends and for the chance to taste the best (imho) products of german brewmasters.
3474,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,5,
3475,Kloster Kreuzberg Dunkel,4.38,visiting my son and daughter-in-law in germany. we took a day trip to the kreuzberg monastery for lunch and beer. bought a very cool growler to bring home (filled with beer of course). the monastery sits on top of a mountain and has beautiful views.  one of the smoothest drinkable beers in germany. great aftertaste.
3476,Double Galaxy,4.5,always love when i get a chance to drink some hill farmstead and as usual it did not disappoint. soft with great aroma and flavour from the hops that was easy drinking and went down way too fast.
3477,Double Galaxy,4.15,can from jeff thanks for the hookup! hazy bright lemon orange color with a thin white head that slowly dissipates. tropical orange and bits of pine and grass. sweet bready backbone. pretty nice beer.
3478,Double Galaxy,4.3,16oz can dated 9/8/22.  pours clear gold with a chill haze and a half-inch head. retention and lacing is moderate. grape and peach in the nose. aromatics are unexpectedly subdued. medium bodied with a crisp almost tacky mouthfeel. white grape dank resin and faint garlic on the palate. finishes with a firm bitterness light malt and lingering dank grape must.
3479,Double Galaxy,4.65,on tap at armsby abby.  l -- golden orange with the usual hf fluffy sticky white head s -- what a lovely showcase of galaxy. not too sweaty/oniony just tons of tropical fruit creamy citrus flesh and sweet floral. doesnt pop out of the glass like trilliums galaxy-forward offerings t -- while the pineapple and orange sherbert notes of galaxy are definitely there theres also a decent amount of this interesting nelson-like white grape character and also a hint of mosaic-lile cattiness. oat forward malt bill makes for a neutral sweetness f -- i love the hill farmstead mineralic mouthfeel both tannic and soft. fluffy o -- favorite of the single hopped hill farmstead dipas  93/100
3480,Double Galaxy,4.37,canned on: ?????  a - dark golden orange color with moderately dense bright white lacing thats very creamy looking.  s - dank passion fruit peach and citru with dank spicy citrus rind on the nose.  t - dank citrus and peach take center stage on this one followed with pineapple spicy citrus rind and some peppery notes.  m - big medium body with a soft smooth texture  o - as expected this is a pretty fantastic d-ipa. not a 100 (imo) but its up there!
3481,Double Galaxy,4.62,this is very close to a perfect ipa in my mind. great representation of galaxy hops. nice white head. sticks around. smells like candied pineapple and bubble gum. taste has the pineapple on the front but a nice bitter backbone. body isn’t too thick which makes it remarkably drinkable
3482,Double Galaxy,4.06,can into glass canned 8 days prior to review. medium thick frothy white head that quickly thins out. vivid cloudy medium orange color with much intricate lacing to start off with. the aroma has a candied malt guava pineapple a little mixed sweet spice underneath. flavors of candied tangerine peel guava passion fruit with a bit of help from some medium toast malt in the background to fill out the body and some of the flavors. there is a bright effervescence to it as well. the finish is largely a mixed citrus peel glow then a moderate bite.
3483,Hercules Double IPA,4.17,clear golden hued body; dense slow rising carbonation; thick white head long lasting semi-creamy texture. initial scent of floral and tropical fruit notes; mild spicy zestiness; very faint earthy maltiness. very mild cereal grain flavor carrying a zesty spicy hop flavor; white pepper sage and turmeric; moderate bitterness; very quiet alcohol presence. medium-heavy mouthfeel; smooth and lightly velvety; bold alcohol warmth presence; semi-dry at the finish.  i know ive had this beer before likely before my beeradvocate days. regardless this is my first rating and review of this beer. it is a solid easy drinking imperial india pale ale. simple yet alluring.  pouring temperature: 46 °f; canning info: 5/11/23 source: local purchase
3484,Hercules Double IPA,4.15,12 ounce bottle into a great divide snifter. clear liquid gold and a nice fluffy foam from an aggressive pour. smells like colorado.. the dank pine jumps right out there’s a sweetness on the nose from the malt. tastes big. a punch in the mouth of well balanced maltiness and stanky piney hops. resiny. crisp finish featuring a bitter hop note. high medium to low heavy mouthfeel medium carbonation. overall i’d drink these every gah dam day if they were sold in florida..
3485,Hercules Double IPA,4.5,looks almost crystal clear. def not hazy. def my style.  smells like pot. i cant smoke it but i sure like the smell and beer taste of it.  tastes super dank. super weedy. sweet and caramely with a sticky sticky resinous piney darkness. old school as fuck and super big on malt and hops.  feel is oily and gelatinous. finishes very crisp though. intriguing beer.  overall - ive definitely had this before but i always seems to ignore great divide for whatever reason. i think im primarily annoyed by their yeti series and how they absolutely try to milk the fuck out off it but thats another topic. regardless its been a long time since ive bought a gd beer (probably close to ten years) but this beer is a super nice reminder of where beer was at 10-15 years ago. very dfh 90 minute-esque as well. an ipa not ashamed to be malty and unpalatable to virginia beer enthusiasts.
3486,Hercules Double IPA,3.94,pine pine pine bitter bitter bitter bready bready  very old school not hoppy
3487,Hercules Double IPA,4,citrus hints and malt dominates this dipa and the hops come in the form of deep woods/ pine forest. other more non-description tropical fruits appear as this warms. you’ll hear others say this really comes to life as it warms. i agree. tasty stuff. big pine notes with plenty of sweet nutty/ tea-like malts without the sweetness being a turnoff. like many also note the hops don’t dominate here.
3488,Hercules Double IPA,3.32,the can i have isnt expired but not the freshest but this is so malty im wondering if they some how canned a brown ale. if this how this normally is then its honestly awful to me. zero hops just malt like this is so disappointing ill have to try again to see.   seeing as how i have the lowest review on here i looked at others and theyre all as flabbergasted as i am. i really hope we all got bad bottles or cans and it will be better next time.   update after trying again i more or less confirmed what i thought while also liking this more. still not for me but for those more into malty ipas.
3489,Hercules Double IPA,3.61,rerate 355 ml bottle courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 9.1%. 85 ibu. orange to amber colour slightly hazy. moderate but lasting off-white head with an orangey hue. pleasant aroma of fruity american hops. the flavour is an aggressive hoppy explosion from start to finish on a malty sweet (too sweet?) background. very bitter aftertaste. not for the faint of heart - but i might get used to this ... i’m upping it a point. original rating: bottle at the rover göteborg. amber colour hazy. sweet and alcoholic aroma and flavour but also plenty of hops as expected from a double ipa. a bit overdone on both sweetness and hops in my book but still a good beer.
3490,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,4.15,reminds me of a lower abv version of their “the great pumpkin”. i wish there was more than the token amount of head. there is no lacing. beautiful clear copper color though. pumpkin pie on nose and flavor. medium body. fine to very fine carbonation in the mouth. nice.
3491,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,4,this beer has been on the list since i started getting into pumpkin ale more last year. i believe pumpkin and malt and hops go together. great flavor great pumpkin overall very good. i just wish they would have toned down the spices. it took me a bit to figure out if it was too much hops or too much spice. perhaps this needs to sit for a month because it is super fresh. and the spice may mellow out a bit. this is still great work. cheers!
3492,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,3.81,night owl… which is funny because who thinks of an owl during the day? ain’t no one going “hoo hoo” when you are off to get wings at b dubs. it’s like calling a beer “night prostitute.” like boomin’ betsy does not work the day shift.  anyway the beer is pretty good.  see ya.
3493,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,3.42,bought the elysian pumpkin pack to bring on the holiday spirit early you can taste all the spices in this with a slight after taste of the pumpkin. nice seasonal variety right here
3494,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,4.25,cinnamon vanilla clove/ginger slight pie crust on smell and taste is ginger/spices with slight bitterness from the pumpkin and hops. some caramelized sweetness reminiscent of a brown ale. easy to get pumpkin beer i get every year around here in oregon.
3495,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,3.71,clear copper big dense off-white head so-so retention streaky lace. lots of spice on the nose underneath a bit of caramel. spice is a bit more subdued on the palate still the main focus some caramel malt just a bit of roast pumpkin. medium-heavy bodied appropriate carbonation. tastes like a pumpkin beer. they pulled it off a bit better than others do but still too spice focused for me.
3496,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,5,this beer tastes like the water from a touch tank at the aquarium 10/10 love it
3497,Night Owl Pumpkin Ale,3.93,poured from a can into a pint glass. pours reddish orange with a fluffy white head. smells of pumpkin pie inviting. tastes of pumpkin pie and cinnamon. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall a very good beer.
3498,Yellow Bus,4.53,appearance: pours a somewhat hazy golden color with a one finger head that fades to a collar; squiggles of lacing  smell: barnyard funk and tart peach with a floral peach blossom element; very oaky  taste: vinous peach with barnyard funk and a floral aspect; oaky and tart through the middle with a dry somewhat sour finish  mouthfeel: medium body with moderate to high carbonation; puckery  overall: a delightful sour with all the elements in perfect harmony
3499,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.78,this is a nice enough american take on a belgian quad but fails to bring the depth and profundity of the great classics of the style. all the basics are there but you’re left wanting a little more richness of flavor more lingering booziness in the finish fullness and creaminess rounding out the carbonation. solid but a little unremarkable and a quad should if nothing else be remarkable. big boulevard booster here but this isn’t the one in their portfolio i’d return to very often.
3500,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.77,poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of cherries raisins. taste is cherries malts and alcohol. feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer.
3501,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,4.14,appearance: pours a slightly clear (40% clarity) medium to dusky bronze color with a massive tan head that overfills the glass. (4.25)  aroma: strong aromas of rich bread orange citrus belgian spices of some cloves and floral notes. then smooth caramel off the back end. (4.00)  flavor: strong and rich flavors upfront of rich bready malts with some belgian cloves and floral components. rich. then it follows with some orange citrus sweetness and yeasty notes off the end to dry it off a bit. (4.25)  feel: heavier-bodied stronger carbonation though. yeasty bready soft smooth and somewhat dry from the yeast. (4.25)  overall: a really nice and drinkable belgian quad here. rich bready with authentic belgian spices. some orange citrus sweetness but ultimately a very bready and yeasty body that dries the body and it drinks deceptively clean for 10.2%. spot on belgian flavors and a great quad here. (rating: 4.19)
3502,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.88,tried it in the past and thought i really liked it then. went back to it this weekend and it seemed to have a grapefruit tang or some other strong citrus flavor to it which i didn’t really enjoy.
3503,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,4.01,12oz bottle best by march 27th 2024  on an average pour a massive 4 finger off white to tan head formed. dissipated to 3 fingers after a couple minutes. streams of fine carbonation come out of a very hazy dark amber body. after trying to get the rest into my glass the 4 fingers of head immediately came back. sticky but sparse lacing forms.  aroma is slightly boozy with a nice belgian yeast character that brings some sweet spicy and lightly fruity notes. a caramel sweetness and light nuttiness is present from the dark malts. comes off as a big beer but not a 10%+ beer.  the taste is very close to the smell with some added hop bitterness. less fruity esters but the spicy belgian character mixes with an alcohol flavor making this pretty intense on the spectrum of non barrel aged beers. despite the initial intensity once the bitterness and alcohol dies down after a few seconds a malty smooth nuttiness and caramel sweetness round everything out.  the feel full bodied with a definite maltiness but this beer is highly attenuated and not as thick as doppelbocks. the alcohol isnt felt at first but as you drink more a slight warming sensation begins within the body. long but smooth finish. a very nice armchair/celebration beer.  overall this was a pretty nice beer. also a very good candidate for cellaring. i held onto this beer for roughly 5 months but it was in the fridge. maybe it improved? im not sure.
3504,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.94,a deep red amber body and a long lasting light tan head. tons of aromas- raisins  dark fruit plus cherries. tastes of dark fruit and malt. the mouthfeel was somewhat off putting to me ... i was wanting more body as the feel was on the thin side and carbonation was a bit high.
3505,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,4.84,if there ever was a perfect looking brew this is it. pours an opaque mahogany with a light sand colored head that stands tall and proud. frothy foam lace just hangs on the sides of the glass forever. smell and taste of dates raisins in malt. sweet top front with a ever so slight bitter note on the aftertaste. how can one not feel good with this quad. 10.2% abv and lots of carbonation. had to round ups to a 5 overall because this is one of my favorite beers. this is the craft beer that started me down the road to find a more percent craft brew.
3506,Citrus Squall,3.9,pours a medium-dark yellow color with a minimal head that disappears quickly. aroma of grapefuit but the taste is very strong grapefuit. slightly salty and no hoppy bitterness. a good summer brew.
3507,Citrus Squall,4,bought a 6-pack cans $11.99 foodland 4 months before jan 2024 stamp on can smell of passionfruit grapefruit citrus hazy golden-orange color medium-heavy mouthfeel taste of grapefruit passion fruit some tartness oranges on the aftertaste alcohol hidden really well overall a refreshing hot weather beer if you like grapefruit as it is strongly present.
3508,Citrus Squall,4.32,incredibly refreshing smells and looks awesome. taste wise it has an upfront hit of grapefruit and hoppiness but it isnt bitter at all. the 8% abv is super well disguised and you can easily tear through multiple cans of this on a warm summer night or day.  overall its a very good beer and one of the best ive had.
3509,Citrus Squall,4.59,this brew boasts a hazy yellow appearance and a lasting white head. the nose is fascinatingly complex; there is an agreeable bitterness to it. the beer is medium-full bodied. it tastes earthy and vegetal in a good way. the high abv isnt apparent in the palate or nose. this is an enormously interesting -- and successful -- experiment. its weird in the best possible way. ill have it again -- soon!
3510,Citrus Squall,4.07,12 ounce can poured real cold into a can glass. stubborn foam barely stayed for a photo op. smells of grapefruit. lime. taste stymied me a little. thought dfh was gonna try to make me like a kinda sour ale. wrong! there’s the grapefruit thing right up front hop yada yada then ‘bing!’ there’s tequilla in there. i know i know it’s ‘blue agave’. but my brain told me something else. it’s not a sour folks it’s a summer quencher. and it does just that. mouth is light and lively. medium carbonation. overall a surprise hit that i wish was just a bit prettier.. nice!
3511,Citrus Squall,4.16,dogfish head craft brewery citrus squall 12 fl. oz. can coded: jan 2024 d 194 3 1405 11. sampled on aug 13 2023. $2.33 @ wegmans king of prussia pa  notes via stream of consciousness: i\ve just sampled the hazy squall so i\m wondering what this is. the label says that it\s a double golden ale with grapefruit juice lime peel and blue agave nectar. ok then. it\s poured a hazy golden body beneath a finger\s width of white foam. the aroma expresses grapefruit and light malt. on to the flavor then it\s surprisingly sweet. it tastes like a grapefruit candy. i didn\t get any of the lime peel in the nose but i get some of it here. i get a little bit of alcohol but not much. the malt is sweet and lightly grainy bready and oat-like. i like it and it works well to support the fruitiness that\s there. grapefruit is generally a bitter fruit but i\m not finding that here. there\s some coming out in the finish but i would think it would be more bitter overall. that\s ok i like it. it\s a one-trick pony but it\s a good trick. i generally think of fruity beers like this as multiple serving beers but not this one. it\s 8% abv to start and although it\s sweet i think that after two or three that bitterness from the grapefruit will start to build. i also think that you\ll just be bored with it by then regardless of how good it is to start with. on the negative side the head did not hold up well and thus it left next to nothing in terms of lacing. i really like this but it is a kind of a one and done beer although at 8% that\s not necessarily a bad thing i think it\s nicely balanced and rounded and quite enjoyable. if you love grapefruit you\ve gotta get citrus squall. review #8714
3512,Citrus Squall,3.99,picked up a sixer last week at shoppers in germantown. seemed a good match for all the heat weve been having. nose is grapefruit and lime and i guess agave. flavor brings the sour citrus early and then flattens in out where the aftertaste is complex yet clean. not really what im looking for from a flavor or style standpoint and i am in no ways a tequila drinker but this is actually pretty good for what it is. you dont taste the eight percent much either. for eleven bucks a sixer you could do a lot worse.
3513,Citrus Squall,4.43,poured from a can into a sampler glass at a tasting festival. my sadness in learning that sea quench ale is no longer being distributed here due to low sales was overshadowed by this delicious brew. hid the alcohol taste well and went down smooth. cheers!
3514,Oktoberfest,3.2,in 2020 this was an excellent beer but not anymore. better options are out there; ayinger and devils backbone for example.
3515,Oktoberfest,4.16,hello great lakes! wow this was one gives a nice bold marzen punch right out of the gate. mouthfeel is quite nice and juicy taste sticks around for awhile. really a classic oktoberfest taste with this one. i feel like if i was given multiple choice i could name this brewery with a blind taste test. something about a great lakes beer that sticks out to me. definitely satisfied with a purchase of this 6 pack. i forget how much i enjoy oktoberfest beers.
3516,Oktoberfest,4.22,12 oz bottle exp date 11/1/23 into a dimple mug. l: pours rusty deep amber with a thin creamy off white head that goes down to edge foam light steady carbonation no lacing. s: caramelized malts raisins brown bread lightly floral a hint of alcohol with warming. t: bright over ripe citrus leafy a hint of grapes toasted grains lightly sweet & malty then rich caramel & citrus that linger. fairly fruity with plum & skin. slightly earthy with mild bitterness. f: bright and smooth medium-heavy mouthfeel with a robust middle and a long slightly dry finish. o: this beer stands out in the okto crowd due to its magnificent taste feel and finish. feels a touch warming as well. a perfect marzen for cool autumn weather. it is outstanding in its style.
3517,Oktoberfest,3.97,nice  drinking from the bottle so i can’t see it or describe the head.  i don’t smell anything. blame my nose.  tastes roasty and malty with just a little hoppy bite on the back of the tongue.  nice märzen.
3518,Oktoberfest,4.33,purchased as part of a mixed 4 pack from wegmans in collegeville pa on 8/28/23! no visible bottle date but a printed enjoy by date of 11/1/23.  l- clear copper color.  s- caramel and roasted malt.  t- very well balanced hop and roasted malt flavor. hop bitterness up front followed by an almost creamy caramel flavor.  f- very smooth slightly crisp. fine carbonation.  o- wow! what a fantastic oktoberfest!
3519,Oktoberfest,4.05,bottle from trader joes
3520,Oktoberfest,4.14,pours out of the bottle a crystal clear dark amber with minimal head. the smells are wonderful that include toasty malt and maybe some carmel. tastes follow the scents with some breadiness and spices. only draw back was that it felt thin in terms of the mouthfeel but luckily i dont drink beer for that reason! fantastic märzen!
3521,Oktoberfest,4.15,appearance: deep and clean amber with a pleasing off-white head and limited lace.  nose: warm toasty autumnal caramel and toffee. very nice.  taste: rich sweet malty. pretty big flavor punch here full of toasty malt and a slightly hopped zing at the finish. a bigger flavor profile than traditional marzens and a surprisingly enjoyable and unique take on the style. really liked.
3522,Oktoberfest,4,pours a light opaque brown with a small head. slightly sour and malty aroma not very much. touch of sourness in the taste mildly sweet maltiness some caramel very little bitterness. medium body. a very good oktoberfest.
3523,Oktoberfest,3.69,great lakes is a brewery that i am growing to appreciate more and more. i have never been disappointed by any beer of theirs that i have sampled and their oktoberfest is no exception. this is a marzen style beer that i would assume many us drinkers would associate with the oktoberfest style. dark burnt orange in appearance this beer pours with a rather quickly subsiding head that doesnt leave much lacing. the aroma offers caramel and roasted malt notes that are very inviting. taste does not disappoint offering the same malt notes with a pleasant caramel undertone. this is another quality offering from great lakes worth seeking out.
3524,Slapasaurus,4.07,first impressions arent good. theres way too much stark white foam just from cracking open a pint can with resultant overflowing. the attempted pour to try to empty the cans contents into a clear glass liter mug is also frustrated by all the foam. thats surprising as high abv brews usually arent this foamy. obviously theres more than barley malt here providing the starch backbone. the foam recedes unevenly unattractively and leaves erratic lacing inside the vessel. once it can be determined the liquid is light copper-amber bright and somewhat translucent. the aroma is limited to a dry hoppiness with some vague starch. it doesnt taste badly. of course theres alcohol present and its immediate. the hop taste is vague maybe piney but certainly bittering. the biggest surprise and the biggest plus is the mouthfeel. despite an alcoholic burn to the taste buds this is remarkably soft and smooth across the tongue. overall it actually has a tasty malted backbone along with a nice dry hop bite to finish. the pronounced taste of alcohol is mitigated by its smooth mouthfeel and that it has an abv close to 10%. this is another example of alcohol adding to the sweetness upfront then drying out the bitterness at the finish. a final surprise is the stratified glass lacing once the foam subsided there are many worse options to down a pint for a serious beer buzz.
3525,Slapasaurus,4.28,appearance - the beer was golden yellow in appearance with visible carbonation.  smell - the iconic 3 floyds dankness is followed by fruity notes.  taste - there were definite citrus fruit notes. the malt presence was somewhat weak despite the big body. the big mover was the lemon dankness that lingered nicely.  mouthfeel - the body was big leading to a lingering profile.  overall - this is definitely worth checking out for floyds fans.
3526,Slapasaurus,4.46,the seldom studied and often forgotten imperial american ipa may be a beer destined for the history books but 3 floyds is single handedly keeping the style alive with this dinosaur of a beer.  slapasaurus hits the glass with a medium amber appearance rounded with a reasonably hop induced haze. as its creamy off-white froth builds so to a host of tropical fruit aromas with citrus spruce and grassy herbs in the backdrop. but a malty-sweet upstart gives the palate a calmer taste of honey caramel graham cracker and granola with the beers opening taste.  as the malts stew persistently on the middle palate a quick followup of hops give a bold tropical impression of pineapple mango and papaya. not to be outdone more citrusy tones of red grapefruit tangerine and lime aid the beers racy and fruity zest. trending rapidly bitter the taste develops a strong and deeply resinous bite with flavors of fruit peels pine needle fresh-cut grass and hemp in its wake.  medium bodied and sticky with both malt and hop resins the session finishes decidedly on the bitter side of bitter-sweet with drier take on malty-dry as the spicy ale comes to a close. a long follow through of pine sap citrus remnants and curaçao liquor-type spice comes in perpetual waves.
3527,Slapasaurus,4.49,on tap pours a very slightly hazy orange. smell and taste are more old school west coast ipa which is fine by me. pine resin and grapefruit dominate. nicely bitter. no booze taste at all. very drinkable medium body. fantastic beer.
3528,Slapasaurus,4.5,pours a bright mango color with a subtly unfiltered appearance and a foamy pearl white head that provides significant lacing and caps the beer on its entire journey. gorgeous beer.  the nose features loads of mango papaya guava pineapple and candied orange notes. this beer is setting up especially well for my palate. i gotta admit i love when that happens.  the taste is all about the bitterness that settles at the back of your palate after enjoying the vibrant mango candied orange papaya guava and pineapple flavors you experience up front. if you don’t enjoy bracingly bitter wcdipa’s avoid this beer at all costs.  if you do enjoy those og beers as i do so much this beer is your jam especially with the full exceptionally dry mouthfeel. i found this listed on the 3f’s website as 74 ibu’s and 98 ibu’s.  it is definitely the latter imho. and if it moved from the “limited release ipa’s” category to always available it would be in my beer fridge every day of the year.
3529,Slapasaurus,4.56,color is on the copper side. light to tan head. nose is magical nice and piney. taste was pine and slightly citrus. good amount of bitterness on the backend.
3530,Focal Banger,4.75,heady topper has a thick off-white head and a mostly-clear golden appearance with lots of suspended sediment throughout. the aroma is of citrus hop resins and white bread. it has a similar flavor with strong bitterness. focal banger has a medium body and a mostly-dry finish.  rjt
3531,Focal Banger,4.49,this is a classic right up there with heady and deserves to share the hype of the other. in every way its similar but different in slight and satisfying ways. cant believe it took me till a decade later to get around to this treat.
3532,Focal Banger,4.55,enjoying on the front porch gorgeous cool august day the 18th 2023. (canned on 8/15/23!)  so excited to find this treasure at our washington beer store.  gorgeous straw/light golden color slightly hazy with white foam of tiny bubbles dissipated quickly leaving fine lace on glass edge.  very fruity aromas of pineapple papaya mango luscious lemon and even malt!  immediate bitter hits the tongue which gives way to the fruit flavors and ends sharp grapefruit rind.  this hits all the right notes for an excellent neipa for me! leah prefers the sweeter heady topper whereas ill stick to this one as my favorite!  edit.... we had bought two cans and we drank the second one fiber nights after the first one. i had worked hard on a pool electrical job in the sun that day and wow!... what an intense beer to drink after a hot day on the sun. by the time we were on the porch it had cooled off considerably and it was raining..... drinking this focal banger was pure joy! pine hop depth in your face hoppy bitterness..... pure joy!
3533,Focal Banger,4.68,l - hazy golden with a large thick white head that sticks around leaving behind a good amount of lacing s - fresh bright piney resinous bitter hops floral notes fresh grass grapefruit and other citrus notes and malt t - follows the nose: fresh bright piney resinous bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with grapefruit and other citrus notes with a nice malt backbone. slightly dank f - medium leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. smooth. o - another world class ipa from alchemist - a softer version of heady
3534,Focal Banger,4.5,picked up a four-pack from the stowe brewery 7-29-23 for $13. canned 7-25-23; consumed the first two for review 7-30-23.  beer poured a hazy golden with a nice white head that has sustained hang time.  nose is very nice fresh citrus abounds from the glass long after pouring.  taste is spot on. the light pale malt base displays the grapefruit forward hops and it tastes like the pink grapefruit fresh off my tree at my old phx house in the spring. finishes with a superb rind and pine bitterness; 7/10 on my scale.  mouthfeel is light bodied with each sip very refreshing.  overall yep the hype is correct on this one. this is a world class ipa!
3535,Focal Banger,4.34,canned on 7/18/23 - just 15 days ago!  drank most from can as directed but did pour 4 oz amount in rocks glass for appearance  appearance – the beer pours a lightly hazed lime-yellow color with a small head of white foam. the head has a good level of retention fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.  smell – the aroma is strong of a grapefruit and herbal hop smell mixed with notes of cracker malt and a touch of bread and toast. other hop aromas of pine and earth are there as well with all the aromas having a fresh “raw” like smell. hints of caramel and a sizeable grass like smell are there as well giving a rather green smell overall.  taste – the taste begins with a crisp cracker malt body paired with a lot of the “raw” hop that was present in the nose. an herbal hop is the biggest but is accompanied by a decent showing of grapefruit as well. other light earthy flavors mix in as time goes on all while a little bit of caramel and orange that were present upfront fade. the grass that was in the nose also joins the scene all with a bit of an increase in the hop. toward the end the fresh hop taste steps it up even more giving a quite heave hop pellet like taste to linger on the tongue.  mouthfeel – the body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a moderate carbonation. for the mix of big fresh hop with crisp body the middle of the road mouthfeel balances the two attributes rather well.  overall – a rather fresh raw hop pellet tasting ipa. i like it but in some ways a bit unbalanced with bitterness at the end. certainly a great brew although i am not sure it deserves as much hype as it gets.
3536,Focal Banger,4.35,hell of a good tasting beer. i get some bitter citrus and a snappy hop bitter finish. would not call it hazy by any standard based on taste. i’m drinking from the can as per instructions so can’t say anything about the look.  tasty beer but at a tough price point for my blood. now and again if i see it…
3537,Focal Banger,4.64,pours a hazy yellow color.  aroma: orange and papaya a little bit of pineapple.  taste: follows the nose. some malty sweetness balanced with citrus pith.  overall: this is a wonderfully balanced beer. nice fruity flavors with just the right amount of bitterness. an outstanding hazy.
3538,Focal Banger,4.86,amazing like i was told. they say leave it the can but i poured it into my can glass lol..
3539,Boskeun,4.1,330ml bottle into a tulip. no bottled on date but likely a few years in the bottle.  hazy golden yellow body with a persistent white head. yeasty aroma and the taste adds a warming sweetness to it.
3540,Boskeun,4.6,one year old. can to wine glass.  l: pours a slightly opaque golden brown with an extremely stable pillowy white head that leaves plenty of lacing. some tiny yeast floaters visible.  s: herbal grassy and fruity with notes of fresh bananas. malty and minimally sweet.  t: herbal and spicy. malty and hoppy. sweet and bitter. fruity and earthy. dominant notes of ripe bananas and honey.  f: full and crushable at the same time. medium carbonation. quite warming.  o: full of contrasts yet nicely balanced and very complex. tastes like a classic belgian blonde with a twist and definitely sticks out of the mass. great modern interpretation of the style. very well crafted.
3541,Boskeun,4.21,pours a hazy (i always aspirate my yeast back in) deep orange colour. plenty of bubbles run up the side of the glass supporting an incredibly dense head that has these big rocky bubbles at the top. gorgeous honestly  a sweet mild herbal and yeasty aroma. banana and general phenolic spices present as well.  all my last reviews have been simple ‘taste follows the nose’ but not this one. the aforementioned aromas are present in the palate but it’s quite a complex and interesting flavour profile. first off the abv is present but in a complementary way. it inflects off of the delicious yeasts and drives up the spicy phenolic character quite a bit. cloves cinnamon on the back end… cardamom? not sure if that’s what i’m thinking but there’s something else in there too.  banana bread honey the floral notes in the aromas are transformed into more earthy tones here. maybe this sounds strange but apple peel? usually i taste fruit in beers it’s just ‘apple’ or ‘pear’ rarely peel unless it’s citrus zest in hop forward beers. but i get a real apple peel flavour here.  medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation that is fairly active lightly tickling bubbles. beer definitely leans to the dryer side on the finish and despite the sweet notes that are all throughout the beer the dryer finish brings out the bitterness that’s present in the background of this beer.  well if i knew this was an easter beer i would’ve saved it for easter but only after i cracked it did i read it was. a beer i’ve never ever seen in canada nor will we likely ever this was a special gift from a friend who brought it back from the good ol united states. it’s beautiful looking complex and delicious. goodness me i wish i had another one to open on easter. oh well what can you do. this is belgian goodness in a bottle. i’d honestly say i’m liking it as much as orval and i’ve got 5 of those in my cellar!! hope to be able to get another one of these soon!
3542,Boskeun,4,present from diamonds des who floats around the globe big blonde beauty with frothy white head candy notes in the flavour nice kick at the tail end of the flavour
3543,Boskeun,4.19,12oz undated can poured into a teku glass at 55° fahrenheit 9% abv. the beer pours opaque golden amber with off white head. the head recedes to a thin ring and island of tiny bubbles. the aroma is mild with general sweetness up front followed by caramel banana and clove. the taste is semisweet pale malt with notes of honey clove and earthy moderate bitterness. the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with average plus carbonation. the finish is an enigma being almost completely dry despite the sweetness of the beer. perfect combination of carbonation abv and dryness for drinkability. alcohol is mostly hidden except for the warming effect on the throat and belly. overall excellent bspa.
3544,Boskeun,4.85,one of the best beers ive ever tasted. loved every sip. drank the 9% version and hated to swallow it!
3545,Boskeun,4.1,on tap at armsby abbey. clear golden with an ample white head. smells of herbal notes earthy belgian yeast sweet golden malts and some booze. tastes fruity with herbal undertones sweet honey some slightly deeper maltiness and spice and clove from the yeast. boozy fairly sweet and pretty heavy. but quite tasty.
3546,Boskeun,4.34,had this on draft 6/12/21 @ the beer temple.  cloudy orange/yellow appearance.  big fluffy white head; frothy lace.  mulled cider pear green apple banana & mild clove notes in the nose.  medium mouthfeel.  earthy esters green apple & faint caramel flavors up front; clove mild banana & faint cinnamon notes on the finish.  bold; fruity & earthy at the same time. really really good.
3547,Boskeun,4.04,poured from a 12oz can (courtesy of b united container project) into a chimay goblet. friendly canned on sticker on pack of may 12 2021.  a: burnished gold/amber with 1-2 finger foamy off-white head with short retention but does leave some scraps of lacing.  s: aroma is a bit light but mainly banana pear and golden apple with an interesting earthy hop note.  t: flavor is quintessential belgian golden ale with solid but soft pale pils maltiness and candi sugar sweetness with plenty of apple pear and some banana yeast ester presence. phenols are noticeable but low and the alcohol character is also noticeable but pleasant. hop flavor is not readily apparent but there is clear bitterness in the background that is more noticeable in the finish. definitely an earthy phenolic note in the finish and aftertaste. overall this is a sweet beer despite this bitterness.  m: medium body with moderate-high carbonation and medium dry finish  o: i enjoyed boskeun but wished it had a bit more aroma and slightly more bitterness to counter the sweetness (or a bit lower sweetness). that said a delicious and complex beer
3548,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.12,pours amber with a 2 finger foamy white head. the aroma is spicy with a touch of fruit. the taste is peppery & herbal with notes of citrus fruits and a touch of hoppy bitterness. nice balance to the flavour profile and there is a good level of carbonation too. nice little beer.
3549,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.19,classic belgian yeast caramel taffy banana coriander nutmeg earthy spices... nice and surprisingly easy drinking leaves pretty lacing.
3550,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.05,aroma gives off bubblegum and bananas. the body is an immediate wave of refreshing cool carbonation and the flavor is just like the aroma delectable sumptuous sweet banana bubblegum and some of that coriander spice too. this is a great blonde.
3551,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.52,from a bottle head to head with duvel. pours browner than duvel and tastes darker too like brown honey. nice herbal flavor and light bitterness. i need to figure out what coriander tastes like because everyone says that its here.
3552,La Chouffe (Blonde),3.15,re-reviewing as the last review i wrote was after at about 5 bottles of various triples and quadruples and i was pretty much only seeing pink elephants and elfs. and devils. and satans. and lucifers. is the devil and satan the same? and also lucifer? no lucifer is different from the devil.  bought from my casino supermarket in paris.  there is an elf thing on the bottle. maybe chouffe is an elf..? not sure...  nice look.  in glass loving it. deep red amber colour. nice level of head.  aroma has elements of duvel though much more carbon dioxidy and less apricot fruitness. it seems very heavy without enough hops to balance the heavyness.  taste certainly draws some parallels with duvel and delirium tremens. for me this is nowhere near as well mastered to the same level. flavours are less intense and there is a distinct carbon dioxide/fizzy water flavour. citrus is quite prominent. mainly lemon peel and tangerine.  coriander is listed in the ingredients i also faintly taste peach though overall its balance of flavours is not up there with the best belgian triples. as the carbon dioxide bubbles disappear the taste improves.  i have to disagree with the bros giving it 99. going to have a duvel now to compare. yes duvel is far superior.  try them together there is much difference...  probably the most over-rated beer on this site in my opinion. please try the chouffe ipa. that is so much better and one of my favourite commercially available beers ever. this has too much maltiness...it really needs the extra hops. duvel and delirium tremens are naturally better balanced. without the coriander this would not taste of much at all. and adding coriander is cheating in my opinion. only hops and cannabis should be allowed in addition to malt and sugar. and water obviously.
3553,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.38,slightly hoppy hints of pepper and coriander a clean taste without any alcohol bite despite being 8% abv; it is one of my top three favorite beers. it is always priced better than my other favorites - delirium tremens and chimay white.
3554,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.5,beautiful blonde ale. spicy and inviting aroma. tastes a little like it pours golden honey sweetness with notes of pepper and coriander. imho one of the best around. great brewery in general.
3555,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.33,pours almost clear honey gold with a pillowy white head that lasts clings and forms kind of a whipped cream dollop in the middle of the glass.  smells pretty belgian to me. fruity- apple pear maybe a bit of melon. very estery. sweet malt. peppery coriander phenolic close the show.  the taste is bright but definitely sweet. its quite sweet kind of honey sweet. the fruity melange is very flavorful mid-taste. lots of green apple a banana i missed in the nose melon pear. grassy herbaceous hops but not too much. the aftertaste is a big hit with me - quite peppery a kiss of coriander pleasant phenolic. belgian yeast goodness with a deft overlay of hoppiness.  its very dry fairly lively carbonation. aftertaste sneaks up then theres a wallop of peppery spice some coriander and fruity bubblegum aromatics without the nonsense that comes with bubblegum - maybe more like juicy fruit. apple revisits in the aftertaste as well.  this is some good stuff right here. glad i grabbed the single which are pretty scarce given the wrap-around cardboard four packs.
3556,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.46,excellent beer what stands out to me is the incredibly velvety feel it has. would happily drink this anytime
3557,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.39,poured from a 330ml bottles.  pours a slightly hazy amber with a two finger head that stays for an age . the smell is yeasty orange and coriander tustle with each other whilst the barest hint of alcohol lingers in the background. the taste follows the smell  coriander to the fore over citrus and a mild bitterness rounding it out. the mouthfeel is full and creamy . overall satisfying and tasty  a good beer for an occasion or an occasional beer . very rich and too much so for regular drinking ( for me at least) but still a very good beer.
3558,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.53,500ml bottle in vientiane laos. pours a beautiful cloudy orangey gold colour with a nice retentive head. strong aroma of oranges herb cereal. coriander comes through in the taste. really interesting and enjoyable.
3559,90 Minute IPA,4.82,perfect example of an ipa.  one of the best mainstream ipas out there
3560,90 Minute IPA,4.89,what’s not to like? amazing flavors mouthfeel and great abv. a truly enjoyable beverage
3561,90 Minute IPA,5,type: ipa taste: intense balanced and hop-forward color: deep amber  a standout example of the ipa style. pours a deep amber intense and well balanced. strong hop blends pine citrus and resinous hops. memorable impression. one of my favourites.
3562,90 Minute IPA,4.72,i came across this on a recent rail tour of the us. it’s available in the cafe car on most of amtrak’s long distance services. it looks like there’s no requirement to state the abv of beers at the point of sale as i didn’t realise it was 9% til i had the first sip! lovely stuff though sadly not available in the uk.
3563,90 Minute IPA,5,one of my favorite dipa ish ipas. it has a wonderful full bodied dipa taste but doesnt hit you like a higher alcohol ipa. i love the higher ibu that seems to be lacking in many ipas these days.
3564,90 Minute IPA,3.1,look: sap color orange smell: hoppy malty slightly citrusy and piney hop taste: piney hop rind/pithe malt some sweetness in there slight bitterness that starts to build up but then just kinda doesnt (if that makes any sense) feel: nice full boy low carbonation (the feel of this beer might be my favorite thing about it) overall: pretty crushable fairly tame nothing too offensive. that being said nothing stands out but i suppose you could also say that just means its well balanced. not my cup for ipas but good  *poured from a can on clearance that expires in 4 months so i def think this needs a revisit with a fresh brew.
3565,90 Minute IPA,3.11,pours an opaque rusty orange thin collar of head with good retention and no lacing. nose is sappy hops and malt low grade maple syrup cooked barley and kasha honey sticks. taste essentially follows - malts are sweet (honey maple sap) while the hops impart a pretty tame bitterness and light spice. mouthfeel despite the sweetness and heft isnt too heavy while the carbonation stays light. 90 minute tastes like an ingredient to me - it has a distinct taste (sweet spicy sappy honey) - that might make up the main seasoner in a muffin or a sweet bread. on its own however its a little too overpowering to be enjoyable. i remember 90 minute being this huge outlier when it came out and weirdly it still is in terms of its flavor profile among imperial ipas.
3566,90 Minute IPA,4.53,very smooth almost chewy. my 1st time with this world class ipa today and i am impressed. the alcohol is there and you should be prepared for it but overall the taste smell finish and mouth feel was excellent
3567,90 Minute IPA,4.59,from siciliano’s market in grand rapids - had several times but now a few years - will not wait that long again. pours a clear orange amber colour with slightly tawny coloured head that replenishes nicely with a little swirl. nose is at once hoppy with citrus rind tangerine a touch of tropical fruit and floral aroma  but solidly malty with a subtle caramel note. taste is a barrage of hops - piney citrus orange pineapple and marmalade with a bitterness that is tamed by the sweet toasted malt with hints of caramel and honeysuckle. a sticky slightly resinous full mouthfeel finishes this with a coating bittersweetness.
3568,90 Minute IPA,4.81,easily my favorite imperial ipa and possibly ipa period.  pours a beautiful crystal clear amber color with a tan-white head that long persists as a rim.  aroma is very strongly floral and earthy.  despite being rated as 90 ibus this is not a bitter beer thanks to the adequate amount of malt being added to balance the hops. the flavor is citrusy and earth with a crisp finish making this an easy drinking beer despite its high abv.  really just the ideal poster child for the style of ipas as a whole.
3569,90 Minute IPA,4.21,12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip. best by 7/2023  l: clear amber two fingers of antique-white head the persistent foam leaves lace. s: kind of a malty aroma with notes of citrus and pine. t: earthy hops with less citrus than the nose but grapefruit and pine medium sweet malt herbal tea note nice malt-hop balance moderate bitterness spikes at the finish. f: medium body moderate carbonation smooth frothy feel peppery finish. o: very drinkable balanced well done classic style dipa.
3570,Coconut B-Bomb,4.6,2017 vintage. still plenty of coconut flavor. pours with a brown head and mild lacing. scents of bourbon coconut cocoa and caramel all of which carry over to the taste. hints of dark fruit on the under current. medium bodied easy sipper subtle booze presence. quite enjoyable.
3571,Coconut B-Bomb,4.09,this is for the 2019 release; sent to me by @colts9016 as part of nbw bif #15 poured nearly black which for a winter ale was a bit surprising. still capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing. the aroma was bourbon and that’s about it. the taste followed- there was some roasted malts that came through but i couldn’t find any coconut in the mix. not sure if if it “aged out” or something but i never found it. the feel was excellent for the flavors bourbon is a sipping drink you know. i am glad to have tried this but would like to revisit a fresher version if possible.
3572,Coconut B-Bomb,4.35,bottle: poured a deep brown color ale with a large brown foamy head. aroma of strong coconut notes with some sweet caramelized malt and chocolate notes is quite enticing. taste is a mix of strong coconut notes with sweet caramelized malt notes and some chocolate notes. body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol notes. very enjoyable if you like coconut.
3573,Coconut B-Bomb,4.34,look - black thick w tan head and reading rimming and lacing smell - coconut chocolate a ton of barrel taste - toasted coconut with a ton of barrel along with chocolate and vanilla feel - medium full body with a light carb and creamy overall - really tasty warmer
3574,Coconut B-Bomb,4.64,schiuma cremosa e bel colore beige corpo ebano con riflessi amaranto. profumo di caffè e cioccolato tosature di malto e cocco vaniglia caramello prugna e ciliegia lieve tabacco e bourbon. ingresso goloso con melassa frutta secca disidratata cocco e vaniglia e accenno di liquirizia successivamente le note delle tostature ed una delicata amaricatura assieme alla componente etilica placano la dolcezza. finale dove il cocco timidamente si riaffaccia accompagnato da un rubusto ed elegante abbraccio di bourbon. corpo medio pieno molto vellutato con bassa carbonade.
3575,Burton Baton,4.37,poured from 12-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. dark copper-amber color with orange highlights and orange-tinged white head that left some streaky lacing as it subsided. aroma and flavor are malt forward with notes of orange popping out. very boozy with some oaky barrel astringence. also tons of hop bitterness. as it warms notes of dried fruit and dark bread begin to emerge. id say this is to be enjoyed more as a fine cordial than as a beer. iow a slow sipper.
3576,Burton Baton,4.29,pours a copper color. smells of a light vanilla probably hops and oak. the taste was that of a clean and crisp beer. very tasty and delicious. the 10% abv is hidden but effective. i like it and will definitely get more when i get the next chance.
3577,Burton Baton,3.94,it smells both like wood and the bright freshness of hops with just a little bread water in the background.  it tastes very interesting. the wood sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey... not bourbon because theres no smoke. after the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness.  the mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz. it finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol.  overall its very good. i wouldnt describe it as an ipa. its a beer i cant really categorize. i give it a 4.9 out of 6. i think it would have received over a 5 if it hadnt come right after that insanely good stout.
3578,Burton Baton,4.31,backlog
3579,Burton Baton,4.57,coming back to this after a long time... a real throwback to taste so much malt in a double-ipa though i know this was a cross between a dipa and an old ale. back when dipas first arrived on the scene many of them tasted this way-- like a hopped up barleywine or old ale. if i close my eyes it feels like im back in 1999-- in a good way. dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oak-aging a beer like this. warming caramel and hop notes with the alcohol well-hidden (as it should be). hits the spot on a cold night when snow is in the forecast; masterfully done-- glad i revisited this classic.
3580,Burton Baton,3.7,had this on draft. a: pours orange amber body with off-white head with ok retention and lacing s: sweet orange grapefruit smelling beer with subtle earthiness t: sweet grapefruit taste with a subtle earthy aftertaste; some lemon notes as well m: medium bodied and pretty smooth d: nice mouthfeel and tasting combo; solid drinking beer overall; pretty good beer overall
3581,IPA,4.16,poured from a 16 oz can dated 7/05/23 into a shaker pint glass. l - pours a clear medium amber color with a fluffy white head that dissipates slowly. s - smells malty and citrusy. t - tastes piney hoppy and bitter. f - medium body and carbonation. o - delicious west coast ipa. not sure why i didn’t try this one sooner.
3582,IPA,3.39,appearance: gold haze from particles ok head pretty good retention.  smell: mild pine and citrus aroma.  taste: i think the age might be starting to hit this a bit of sweetness then moderate citrus bitterness but feels like its coming part with a watery body. instead of a blended taste tastes are kind of clashing.  overall: this was canned 8/22/22 bought and reviewing in june 2023. usually i dont review old beers but the 12 pack was refrigerated at the store most of its life and frankly most alesmith is pretty old around here so it serves as a valid review in my opinion. its not bad im sure its better when fresh.
3583,IPA,4.04,purchased as a 4 pack from wegmans in collegeville pa. can date: 3/2/23.  l- bright amber slightly hazy.  s- pine  citrus slight booze.  t- crisp bitter citrus. good malt backbone.  f- very dry crisp and clean.  o- a fantastic wcipa!
3584,IPA,4.52,wow.
3585,IPA,4,overall extremely drinkable. always happy to buy this classic but the new can art is not doing it any favors. the pattern hop art on the side is more at home on the can of a much smaller newer brewery.
3586,IPA,4.43,pours a golden color with a thick foamy head.  smells of bread and yeast straight up.  well not much to say here. straight up simple and delicious.
3587,IPA,3.94,alesmith brewing ipa @ 7.25%  served from a 330 ml can a-pour is gold from the can to a dark gold in the glass with a medium size white head leaving a spotty lace along the tulip s-columbus & citra hops give off a hints of citrus & pine t-american west coast ipa  malt dominates with a decent bitter swallow mf-ok carbonation  big full body ov-very drinkable prost lampertland
3588,IPA,4.25,single 16oz can from party town deep golden color with a thick foamy head good retention. evident grapefruit and pine in the aroma. taste follows suit with a smooth delivery of hops and a firm bitterness balanced by a malt backbone.
3589,IPA,4.28,appearance: pours a golden amber color with a soapy white foam head.  aroma: after pouring i let it sit for a minute. very piney sweet from the malts. hints of pineapple and citrus.  taste: sweet malts up front followed immediately by piney hops and a low to moderate bitterness. great balance. bitter lingers in the finish for just a bit and then it goes clean.  overall: this is a quality beer that stays true to the roots of real india pale ale. i feel like lots of care was put into brewing this and it shows in the product. very happy with this one.
3590,IPA,4.67,smooth and crisp. one of the best i’ve had. not too hoppy and packs a punch. great flavor with no aftertaste. i hope i can find this one in the stores.
3591,IPA,4.28,where have you been my whole life? pours copper in color slightly darker than normal. nose is piney and pure hops. taste follows suit with the pine resin bitterness as a west coast ipa should. glad alesmith is distributing to my area!
3592,Blanche De Chambly,3.98,12oz bottle best by january 31st 2025  on the pour it looks like a lot of the haze has settled out but with a solid swirl of the bottle this becomes incredibly hazy with some larger particles of sediment. the body is an obviously hazy deep orange and the head is fine but not super long lasting.  the aroma is super yeasty but surprisingly malty. not as much citrus as expected from a wit but my sense of smell isnt fully here right now. definitely has some belgian yeast phenols and to a lesser extent esters.  taste is lightly bitter carrying over some subtle but present belgian funk from the aroma but it works well with the bready but crisp malts. there is light citrus and the coriander is lightly present and again works very well with the malt and bottle conditioned characteristics. a bit lighter than expected from unibroue but again my sense of smell is weak.  feel is incredibly smooth and drinkable but with a velvety full malty quality as well. super refreshing and dry as well. this is just a great feeling beer. the best of all worlds.  overall this is a solid and uniquely belgian (oxymoron right?) take on a witbier. solid yeast character backed up by subtle additions of spice and orange but a nice big and full wheaty malt. i would really like to revisit this soon.
3593,Blanche De Chambly,3.78,8/20/23 poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at washington beer store in washington pa.  cloudy yellow. high carbonation from bottle refermentation.  aroma of candied papaya and spices. malt.  taste.... brown bread light hint of sweet candied papaya. tangy and bubbly! leah enjoys the light bready sweetness but the high carbonation not so much:)
3594,Blanche De Chambly,4.5,thick vibrant crackling white head and a hazy orange-gold appearance with some lacing. aroma of spiced white bread and bubblegum. flavor of those elements with banana and low bitterness. medium body. mostly-dry finish.  rjt
3595,Blanche De Chambly,3.88,12oz bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. looks dark gold color with white head fed by a stream of carbonation bubbles. minimal lacing left behind. smell is light grain clove black pepper light wheat bread. taste is wheat bread and crackers up front. middle sees a heavy dose of clove coriander and pepper spice. finish is spicy leaving an apple cider like aftertaste. feel is light and effervescent. overall this is a bice easy beer to enjoy a few of. not too complex but flavorful nonetheless.
3596,Blanche De Chambly,3.93,part of a unibroue mixed 6-pack. pours a gold color with a foamy white head that lasts quite a while. aroma of wheat and spices. taste is spicy and slightly tart. crisp and dry.
3597,Blanche De Chambly,4,12oz bottle dated best before 1/31/25.  pours cloudy gold with a half-inch head of white. moderate retention and lacing. clove bubblegum earthy spice in the nose. light bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. a bit doughy on the palate with minimal malt and a balancing bitterness. finishes with light spice.
3598,Blanche De Chambly,3.41,about two fingers of head on pour nice carbonation. smells of bread and spice. taste fallows closely with bread banana and a twang of spice thats almost burning. smooth but almost overbearing carbonation and watery body. not bad but wouldnt seek out.
3599,Blanche De Chambly,4,this belgian witbier pours a hazy cream gold with a thick frothy white head and strong carbonation. aromas of lemon citrus pale bread malt banana cloves pear and light caramel are followed by robust flavors of lemon citrus wheat coriander and white floral notes. the finish is mildly sweet with a lingering lemon citrus sweetness and a strong yeast presence. the mouthfeel is full with a medium body and a clean gently drying finish. overall this is an expertly brewed and easy-drinking witbier thats outstanding in its style.
3600,Blanche De Chambly,4.22,a: clear dark golden color with some yellow notes towards the bottom of the glass. no real head to speak of which i wish it had  s: oh yea very nice. coriander clove pepper. pears green apples. crackers sweet grains and cardamom. biscuits and hay. grass and a nice herbal note. awesome aroma  t: grainy upfront followed by a big punch of cardamom and clove. pepper spice green apples and pears behind that. big biscuity crackery note and then lots of coriander. earthy grains and a nice belgian yeast presence. a touch of white grapes as well  m: light mouthfeel with strong carbonation  o: quite a nice wit! nice flavor profile and hits all the right notes. could use a bit more head though
3601,Atrial Rubicite,4.5,atrial rubicite? yeah i’m not going to even try with that. you might as well tell raul to read james joyce. either way like a drunk irishmen at the pub this one is a bullseye. it’s perfect in nature like nature.  carry one my children.
3602,Atrial Rubicite,4.79,blend #11 from may 2021 5.1% abv from a 750ml bottle. just about perfect for a wild ale for me still a delightful balance of pure jammy fruit essence bacterial sourness and funk and oak tartness. this is what raspberries are made for.
3603,Atrial Rubicite,4.24,3/31/23 on tap at jester king.  beautiful ruby red. no lacing or head. beautiful raspberry/cherry sourness. borders on wine. lacto fermentation briny-ness.
3604,Atrial Rubicite,5,blend 12 from a bottle and split between two people. this had been on my want list for a long time and it lived up to every expectation i had for it. beautiful colour & aroma super jammy taste and packed a solid sour bite.
3605,Atrial Rubicite,4.38,a: bacterial degradation on the collar which quickly inches in stature until the hasty retreat. despite that a constant longevity to the brim providing a categorical aptness. in the interim a trivial exposure on the collars cling which substantially decreases through the periods. the appearance off the decant comes to a sangria to pansy purple dye while highlighting pompadour to the carafe as the vessel (on transfer) missions a bole tinge. on-top an alabaster cap that brims to a link white per the aforementioned. the coloration presets get stretched on the discharge as a way to represent a semi-transparent elegance  s: an earthy introduction with a relaxed awareness on esters as the microbial contagions adhere to the vintage. confident components to the aged-oppressed raspberries through a matured involvedness from a ripened oldness to an oxidative mephitis. howbeit a calculated fetor that’s initially repressed as the draw comes with an hourly aridness. with this mind the presetting notations reap the aggregates of an array on drupelets ascribing raspberries. the symbolism stretches to a clafoutis complexion while remaining seedy and rooted to the additive. all the while an implication to ethyl hexanoate where the apple correspondences meld softly to the phenolic spin-offs. such bonuses speak to the loitering spices found in eugenol while complimenting the framework over the adjacent ketone (c10h12o2). at no cost a wet – woodsy – hop effect that lends a resin kindness to the leafy tannins aside the peppered herbaceous rearguards. the bacterial agents on lactobacillus are present to the caducity while evolving a camembert refinedness thru the employed (bottle) conditioning. sequentially a more captivating element on the native drivers which offer a nuanced mustiness to cattle sheds amid a smirched growth on stinkhorns  t: the virulence is perceptible on the cellared acidity which comes with a well-bred dryness for yeast explicitness. nonetheless a raspberry opulence to not be overtaken yet an accessory that now parallels the implied draws on clingstone peaches & citron lemons. markedly an isoamyl octanoate nexus to the structure which is supportive to the grains on rusticity. assuaging hops provide a herbal kick to the eugenol compounds that touch on clove when pitching resin to the concourse. the age welcomes a pastoral fondness with a vanilla oak consideration to the tannins on berries as an acetate solvency crawls behind. a movement that expresses abandoned bunker silos while airing farmland mildew on rabbity phenols. moreover an alpaca wool note that corresponds to damp cattlehide as a decanted nuttiness formulates aside moldy caverns. oxidation comes sequentially with an elevated solvency on epoxy while setting up sangiovese commonalities. correspondingly a move in time that’s deftly degassed as dry leather nears tobacco when bordering burnt guaiacols  m: an alleviated sweetness that’s pitted against acidic motorists which is aeriated intentionally to strategically stabilize. there is a minerality factor that resembles an autumn jog with a soft mist while tannins support an attenuated dry rider. in this situation the approach inaugurates a bright vivacity that doesn’t pierce but rather respects the framework as a soft texture grows upon the weathered advancements  o: the vintage has an acerbic presence that’s regulated thru wild yeast auras. phenols that assist esters in an involved growth while malts gently circulate a toasted granularity. chiefly one with an operative uniqueness to the raspberry add-ons as a bacterial exsiccation maps out
3606,Atrial Rubicite,4.43,reddish purple in color with minimal pink to off white around the rim. it smells and tastes like tart raspberries. the mouth is bone dry and moderately carbonated.
3607,Atrial Rubicite,4.4,2020 vintage (blend 10/april 2020); consumed on 7/31/2022  pours a stunningly vivid blood-red hue sporting deep ruby highlights along with a short-lived finger of fluffy soft magenta foam; a few islands of paper-thin cap are temporarily encompassed by an equally thin collar and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.  aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must while oaky lacto-funk evolves in turn over time.  taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red jolly rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end where musty wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish.  mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end drying quietly into the close.  jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft funky underscore leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout.
3608,Aventinus Eisbock,4.49,fantastic doppelbock...  pours out like liquid caramel dark caramel but thick and rich as i would imagine it would. the smell is sweet and malty with just enough of the booze to let you know it will warm you up quick...and boy does it. mouthfeel though carbonated is thick and full-bodied which makes up for it. great beer kinda off the style but a welcomed experience.
3609,Aventinus Eisbock,4.44,dark coppery-red body with a thick beige head. the flavor is alcohol with malty sweetness and a hint of toffee. the finish has some slight hoppiness with the cleanness of a lager. if this isnt perfect its very close.
3610,Aventinus Eisbock,4.37,medium brown cloudy/hazy a bright brown. a bit of a head that persists. nutmeg caramel banana in the nose. fruity. full body smooth feel. nothing off putting. round smooth enjoyable. sweet but not excessively. well balanced. long finish with nothing unpleasant. very good.
3611,Aventinus Eisbock,4.46,pours extremely dark brown dense off-white head ok retention and lacing but im going to give the beer the benefit of the doubt and say that the glass wasnt washed as well as it could have been. smells like a banana bread with raisins thats been soaked in spiced rum. damn. raisins bananas nut muffins caramels clove and a booziness that is warming and prominent but not harsh at all. heavy bodied syrupy but not cloying low carbonation this is a good one for a christmas nightcap. not something i could see drinking more than once a year and only on the coldest of nights.
3612,Aventinus Eisbock,4.08,rich syrupy sweet. very smooth. delicious.
3613,Aventinus Eisbock,4.32,pouts thick syrupy. sweet taste dark cherries hints of buckwheat. not an everyday beer. strong beer. had it with speckled seatrout and herbed biscuits. what a combo!!!
3614,Aventinus Eisbock,5,a: dark brown pour with a dep red hue. little to no head when poured.  s: aroma is very similar to the aventinus. you can smell the hints of toffee and molasses.  t: very rich. the flavors in this beer are concentrated as well as the ab. you get a nice rich bock flavor along with a boozy finish. this is seriously good.  mf: overall tis has a rich mouthfeel and a heavy body. be sure to sip this one.  o: near prefect beer in m opinion. the eisbock is a must try.
3615,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,5,2013 at toronado in 2014
3616,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.56,received a bottle in a trade 12-6-22. 2021 bottling date consumed 6-15-23. abv is 13.3%  beer poured black with a pretty nice tan head that dissipated quickly.  nose is very nice with roasted malts dominating and giving notes of bourbon vanilla and dark fruit.  taste is awesome! large heavy roasted malt base gives a touch of boozy heat with notes of vanilla and dark fruit lingering in the background. finishes perfectly balanced with the heavy roast and barrels the large malt base.  mouthfeel is full bodied chewy and smooth.  overall an amazing brew with a very nice price point!
3617,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.5,2021 vintage. love the boxed presentation as always. popped the top poured down the center of a fw snifter. deep dark xlnt beige foam that laced down with each sip. tequila barrel right up front then chocolate a bit of pepper light molasses. quite aromatic! taste is chocolaty at first then piloncillo vanilla good alcohol burn. on the tongue the tequilla barrel leaves a quick impression then brandy and bourbon bring it all together. great long finish not overly sweet. full mouthfeel medium carb. overall: another winner from firestone walkers incredible barrel program.
3618,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.5,2021 version tasted on tap at the propagator may 15 2022. subtle tequila on the nose. creamy and....just excellent.
3619,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.59,appearance: arrives fudge colored with a beige head that settles in as a film but leaves plenty of lacing  smell: the tequila barrel aromatics dominate but there are lots of complementary aromatics of chocolate spice cake bourbon and brandy  taste: dark chocolate foward with hints of spice cake brown sugar and vanilla; through the middle the barrel tones emerge with tequila leading but the bourbon and brandy also in the mix; the finish brings all the flavors together with a slightly boozy edge  mouthfeel: full bodied with moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet  overall: firestone walkers barrel program is unsurpassed and this is a great example of their creativity
3620,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,5,providentially just got a 4-pack shipped in....  pardon my less-refined lack of nuance but it this batch was just as welcomely-received as any parabola or its variants.  wow looks like quite the internationally-sourced list of ingredients and influences... (doubly longing/lounging to revisit orval about now...)  mighty hit of the flat opaque thick boozy malty salty sweet complex and wood-burnished. got 2 left for a real milestone should i live so long.  one to grab!
3621,PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.63,alright alright alright! (cue the matthew mcconaughey grin)  best smoked beer i’ve ever had. balanced but still gives you a nice kachow in the kisser with that smoke bomb. drinkable af but notable and memorable.  im not a huge smoke beer person and about 1/2 way through a pour i’m usually pawning it off on the nearest buddy…but i’ve ordered this a few times now and drank every bit.  definitely worth the try even if it’s prying you out of your safety zone. not trying it if you’re able should make you reevaluate your life and wonder if you’re having a “failure to launch” (bud dum bum pshhh-matt joke)
3622,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.14,copper to brown in color with a murky complexion. there’s a quarter inch of khaki brown on top. the aroma is of delicious smoked malt. i’m tasting that bold smoked malt flavor but this one is a bit more subtle than some of their other ones. the mouth is moderately carbonated and that smokey taste lingers after the finish.
3623,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),2.86,look: dark brown with a cream head  smell: smokey malty some hops  taste: smoke charcol malt  feel small bubbles prickly
3624,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.46,my first ever a recent acquisition from a trip out of state as its not sold here.  a long-time want and it does not disappoint.  of the 5 beers ive had from this brewer this one comes real close to the best ive had - a 2012 bottle of the dopplebock that i enjoyed on easter day this past spring.
3625,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.1,2023-06-18 500ml can served in a snulip. can is apparently not dated.  pours a murky dark brown with a smallish head and a moderate amount of carbonation. settles into a medium-thickness ring (sustained by said carbonation) and a swirling dusting on the surface. smell is smoke nuts and toffee.  taste is similar -- not as smoky as some other aecht schlenkerlas i have had but quite smokey. toffee and maybe horehound / root flavor in addition to the nuts. moderate barky bitterness.  mouthfeel is light smooth. overall very nice rauchbier.
3626,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.09,pours a murky copper color with a medium top of beige head that dissolves slowly. aroma is of smoked malt smoked ham firewood with some notes of leather dark bread and caramel. the flavour is malty with some slight sweet notes. i sense dark bread with some toffee notes allong with the smoked notes of smoked ham. the finish has some slight bitterness in it as well as some salty feel. mouthfeel is suprisingly smooth with a medium carbonation and a medium body. all in all a very good take on this rauchbier a little less smoky than the other rauchbiers from this brewery
3627,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.15,500ml bottle. poured out a murky dark amber color with a small khaki-colored head of foam. it left sudsy trails of lace on the glass. it smelled of smoked malt caramel toffee and wood. great smoke taste with bready malt toffee and caramel.
3628,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.1,116oz can into a pint glass. no freshness dating.  nice smoky aroma stronger in the taste with a side of bacon. smooth finish.
3629,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.21,lightly clouded bronze appearance with a creamy dense off white head and very nice lacing. the smoky aroma with hints of leather was relatively mild in comparison to the urbock. full bodied mouthfeel with an earthy peaty flavor. modest to average carbonation. decently hopped but not as intense as some of the other schlenkerla’s. like comparing an ipa to a iipa. good one to have if it’s your first smoked beer. everything falls into place from appearance to finish.
3630,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.25,i had this on draft 3/21/23 @ the hopleaf.  mostly opaque brown/orange appearance.  nice off-white head; frothy lace.  candied bacon campfire smoke & faint berry notes in the nose.  medium mouthfeel.  candied bacon campfire smoke & faint berry flavors.  big bold but with a nice sweetness to balance the smoke. id have another!
3631,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.15,pours a deep rich mahogany. i get some creme brûlée/burnt marshmallow on the nose. there is definitely a burnt sugar quality that carries through an underpinning of smoked malt. this is less hammy than your usual schlenkerla profile. in fact im not sure it has much smoked meat character at all. this feels like the smoked beer for the non-meat eater if there ever was one.
3632,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.25,delicious beer really is so so cool as well very little else like it obviously smokey flavours are dominating here smoked meats cigar smoke burned toast there’s a saltiness to it but also a vanilla sweetness some brown bread malt herbal low to medium bitterness on the finish medium to full bodied with medium carbonation thick enough it’s such a fun beer in such a fun style
3633,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier (Lentbeer),4.71,canned: 04/20/22  l: the beer pours a medium to deep amber color with good clarity. the pour results in two fingers of khaki head with good retention. as the beer goes down it leaves a mass of ringed and webbed lacing on the glass.  s: the initial impression is smoked meats but after the beer has had a chance to sit in the glass this fades almost completely. further investigation reveals smoked beechwood and malt with a roasted grain character coming through the smokiness caramel malt a touch of honey bread crust and a very light earthy herbal character.  t: i get smoked malts and a touch of beechwood (fairly restrained compared to the nose) caramel sweetness a nice bready malt character notes of dark fruits a bit of brown sugar and an earthy herbal presence on the backend and finish presenting notes of black tea and fresh cut hay. on the finish there is a nice light bitterness and a minimal hint of noble hop spice complemented by notes of burnt beechwood and dark earth. as the beer warms it sweetens up and the dark fruits come out more in the form of fig and raisin notes.  f: medium to medium-full body with medium carbonation. the mouthfeel is smooth on the front end but quickly turns a bit sticky coating the palate as it goes down. the finish has a delightful light dryness that keeps me coming back for another drink.  o: this is a world class rauchbier. definitely malt forward but the hops come in on the backend and finish keeping the sweetness in check and lending a nice earthy bitterness that keeps this one from being too cloy. as it warms it edges up to cloyness but never steps over the line. for some reason i only get smoked meats on the initial pour of the first can but after a minute or two its completely gone. the mouthfeel is amazing and keeps me coming back to the glass...highly drinkable and highly recommended!  on a final note i have to give props to b. united and oec for their partnership with brauerei heller-trum. their tank container canning project gives us here in the states a chance to drink fresh german beer which is a nice turn after my personal journey of trying to decipher german production codes (with lots of assists from the ba german production code thread).
3634,Natty Daddy (8%),4.59,again beer snobs a good high gravity lager 8 percent abv 5 carbs real good bud light 4.2 abv 6.8 carbs cheap not that bad tasting 1.19 a can unless you wants to get really ripped aka earthquake beer snobs blah a good high gravity lager at a good price steel reserve 1.39 in ohio budwieser should get credit for natty ice natty even natural light for putting out budget beers that are good bud light blah
3635,Natty Daddy (8%),1.92,this is the perfect beer to use to bait the slug & snail traps in my garden. ive found that slugs dont generally like the higher abv ipas but they gravitate towards this stuff. and the 8% abv knocks them right out to then drown in the container. and at $1.50 for a 25oz can its also the least expensive option. so i always have a few cans on hand during the gardening season to thin out the slug population whenever i find that they have been foraging on my young plants. i would never drink this stuff though. in fact i feel embarrassed even buying it and find myself explaining to the bewildered check out girl what im actually using it for. cheers!
3636,Natty Daddy (8%),5,just a great beer.
3637,Natty Daddy (8%),2.49,cheap beer. about the only two things going for it is its healthy alcohol content and its apple-y taste.
3638,Natty Daddy (8%),2.11,first 3 sips is tolerable-cheap for a malt half-can not bad once the 8% abv kicks in oh yeah! knock two of these on an empty stomach and as jessie says you\re in a world of pain. you won\t be tasting much of anything after a can or two of these for sure including those cheap burritos you also got from local grab and go.
3639,Natty Daddy (8%),2.65,welp i can see how the other alcoholics have found this glorious beer towards the bitter end of their drinking cave. it is such a deliciously cozy “end of the line” beer- so high in abv- just chilling there on the shelf trying to blend in with the usual suspects. so cheap and so easy to find at the grocery store.  i went to the grocery store as it was closing. the registers were all closed. the sliding entry doors were closed. i could only go through the exit. i was already drunk so i was okay with breaking the rules. on my right as i entered through the exit sliders (which opened right up for me as most things do when i’m drunk especially when they know they really shouldn’t) were some cases of all the familiar beers stacked up. i carefully examined them to search the abv- my eyes scanning the boxes like terminator- or better yet- bladerunner! quite instantly i noticed the natty daddy. the 8% abv glaring at me like a replicant… pupils not dialating properly…. or whatever the heck harrison ford was picking up on in that scene. i had already read about this particular beer on the reddit forums for alcoholism. i had an aha moment when i saw the 8%abv and the attractive low price. brilliant advertising. it was the easiest choice i have ever made. the only choice. thank you natty daddy. no! i take it back… thank you anheiser busch for providing us with an 8%abv beer that we can easily pick up in a 12 pack at the front of the grocery store beyond the checkout lines when the grocery store is trying to close and has its checkouts and entryways blocked off but there are still stragglers waiting in line and i can sneak in there and buy this tasty and easy to drink poison. and it’s cheap. happy fourth of july.  overall: it’s a 3.2. a cheap disgusting beer with a high abv at a great price. god bless america.  **edit** :overall it’s a 3.5. it’s even better when cold! imagine that. im drinking the one that i stuck in the freezer which became nice and chilled after i forced down the first one. im pleasantly surprised.
3640,Natty Daddy (8%),3.6,i dont have much experience between really cheap high abv beer and really expensive low abv beer. now clearly these are not my favorite but they are a beer i drink often as a college student with cheap taste. you cant really go wrong with this if your primary goal is to get drunk at the cheapest price possible.
3641,Natty Daddy (8%),1.37,so as a stand alone beer this one is pretty bad. tastes bad- like metal. smells weird- hard to explain. looks decent when poured into a glass with a nice color and some decent head- pretty deceiving. however- if you need to get plastered then this is the cheapest way to go. it isnt pretty but so wasnt that girl you took home last night from the family reunion.  now as a side note- i did try an experiment with this beer. got a case of it mixed it with some vodka hawaiian punch orange juice and a bunch of fruit and damn it made a great powerful jungle juice. may or may not have killed some livers though. experiment at your own risk.
3642,Natty Daddy (8%),5,
3643,Natty Daddy (8%),1.87,weirdly smells and tastes of smores. i dont know what it is but that is the flavor i get off of it.
3644,Natty Daddy (8%),2.17,25oz can date code 22223 poured into a pint glass.  a - gold with a white head. lively carbonation rising through the glass.  s - malt- and adjunct-forward.  t - follows the nose. abv is noticeable on the finish.  f - thin-bodied high carbonation. watery finish.  o - not bad but not great by any means. ymmv.
3645,Natty Daddy (8%),1.89,very light golden color with a large white head. the smell is a skunky light malt smell. the taste is grainy and watered down. overall its not good. just my opinion.
3646,Natty Daddy (8%),1.88,expected this to drink harsh with the primary peers being icehouse edge and steel reserve and of course it drank harsh; this category is not at all for the drinking experience rather for getting sloshed so i don’t feel compelled to fault it for that especially at its price point. it holds up well against ihe and sr overall all things considered; but that’s really not saying much. however theres an entirely unwelcome sweetness here that sometimes makes me wish i’d opted for the others. still at $1.69 per 25oz in my area it easily wins against icehouse edge and steel reserve as the absolute most cost-effective buzz that can be had from beer and nowadays is actually cheaper than soft drinks. ultimately achieves what it sets out to do for what it’s worth.
3647,Natty Daddy (8%),1,i picked up a 12 pak of this just to try something different. thank you to anheuser busch for allowing to experience what eating a yeast infected pussy tastes like.
3648,Natty Daddy (8%),2.21,poured from a 25oz can  appearance is not promising on the pour large soda like bubbles that never get over 1 finger and very lively carbonation. color is a dark straw to light gold. looks like cheap lager. head a few minutes in is just a ring around the glass.  aroma is what youd expect. cheap beer. not necessarily revolting but not appealing. it kind of just smells old and oxidized with a tart slightly off aal lager yeast aroma. zero hops detectable. not great but ive smelled worse unfortunately not many.  flavor is not the same as the smell but not better. very light malt forward but the off flavors creep in quickly. a slight tartness and alcohol bitterness and burn are all present. at first it reminded me of expired. budweiser with vodka in it. as you drink the 8% beer the flavor becomes more palatable. not terrible but theres a lot off.  feel is surprisingly easy to put down and the carbonation isnt too intense. the head comes back into existence a bit to give it some thickness and smoothen it out a little. its drinkable but in the stomach it is quite heavy and the abv makes it a bit ridiculous that in the mouth at least its this easy to drink quick.  overall its bad but not to the point where every sip is regret and the abv makes it get better over time. this beer certainly had a time and a place but generally its not a great one to be in. it gets you real drunk without being completely disgusting.
3649,Molson Canadian Ice,2,pretty not good.
3650,Molson Canadian Ice,1,terrible.
3651,Molson Canadian Ice,2.41,finale from the mixed pack. never knew they made an ice version of this. had the original plenty of times though i haven\t seen it in quite some time..but maybe that\s because i haven\t looked for it considering high life is always my go to cheapy. the word  ice  i almost always another way to say  hangover imminent . lets do it.  looks the part. clear yellow big white eggshell head with a shit load of carbonation. nothing left after a finished glass.  chemical comes to mind on the nose with fair hints of alcohol. adjuncts are all there as expected. creamed corn dominant.  taste luckily loses the chemical factor. thank satan thought this was about to be another labatt maximum ice disaster ( the worst disaster since 9/11 ). adjuncts amp up hillybilly asshole level corniness.  feel is rather sticky sweet and corny with a super level of carbonation. swallows with a shallow alcoholic bite and leave your mouth dry as a transexuals vagina.  overall its pretty average. the scent is a throw off the feel is a bit odd but otherwise its just your standard run of the mill brew. probably not worth the imminent hangover.
3652,Molson Canadian Ice,2.25,because it was on a sale rack next to the cash register.  standard version of an ice beer. good lord there must be a real demand for this stuff because everybody and his brother seem to be making multiple versions. its lightly colored lightly hoped and lightly flavored with a higher abv being its primary asset. maybe the target customers really dont mind a lack of malt into their purchase decisions and thats ok too. like roaches and spiders cheap beer has its place in the overall scheme of things.  just the thing for the ice beer ticker who rarely travels north.
3653,Molson Canadian Ice,2.5,pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aroma has slight malt hints the taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent beer
3654,Molson Canadian Ice,1.92,one of the worst beers ive had.
3655,Onyx Coffee Stout,4.35,sampling a cold 32 oz crowler poured into my trusty snifter. canned on 5-17-2023. the beer has been in my fridge for the past few weeks after being sent to me by the arkansas beer champion @russpowell beer pours a rich black coffee color with a spongey tan head of 2.5 com foaming up. this foam fades to a very thin edge layer and the beer leaves legs on my glass but no lacing. aroma is roasted malts and coffee grounds with a very mild char note coming through. no hop character and no sweet malt notes. i also dont get any alcohol notes. first sip reveals a medium to light body with smooth texture. the carbonation is very fine and prickly on my palate. beer does leave a bit of stickiness on my lips after each sip. but it also drinks very easy and i find my self draining the glass very quickly. flavor is roasted malts and coffee grounds also with maybe a bit of dark chocolate to have hints of sweetness. but this is a coffee forward roasty stout from start to finish. i never get any hop character and the low abv is hidden too. a very nice coffee stout. only thing i would improve is a little more depth or thickness to the body. nice beer glad to have tried it!
3656,Onyx Coffee Stout,4.3,32oz crowler courtesy of russpowell. canned (crowlered?) on may 21.  poured into a nonic pint glass this was the color of the inky black depths at the bottom of the ocean. big creamy looking head somewhere between tan and mocha in color. spotty streaky lace.  big rich roasty coffee aroma.  coffee flavor up front but also a toasty nuttiness. theres a light sweetness to it that i cant quite define but it doesnt taste like any sort of sweet adjunct was added. really nice tasting coffee stout.  body is rather thin for the style. lightly creamy mouth feel.  although the beer is listed at 5.3% the crowler states 5.2. i do not consider this an important distinction but im just including it for the sake of fair reportage. really nice easy drinking coffee stout. if somebody were to tell me they considered the idea of a coffee stout pleasing but also something that would be too heavy to drink more than a single gulp of i would suggest this beer to them as an example of how a coffee stout does not have to be heavy. seriously this makes me want to go out and buy some coffee ice cream for dessert.
3657,Onyx Coffee Stout,4.07,pours a dark brown almost black color. completely opaque. thin mocha colored head. aroma has notes of fresh ground fresh brewed coffee and some roasted malt. taste is roasted malt fresh coffee chocolate and some ground coffee. feel is very thin and light - makes it an extremely drinkable stout. in the end i want more body from my stouts. overall its a very well crafted stout and the coffee used in it is excellent.
3658,Onyx Coffee Stout,4.21,ranked #1 american stout #2 beer in arkansas new brewery for me . growler received in bif16 from @russpowell poured into an ozark brewing snifter also from him  thank you!  dark cola brown liquid  thin taupe foam layer that quickly dissipated to a ring no lacings  aroma is fresh brewed coffee  roasted malts  faint chocolate aroma  taste is green  fresh brewed beer . it’s that fresh fresh brewery taste .fresh brewed coffee no acrid bitterness.  thin  light mouthfeel low sudsing more like a porter than a stout  good beer
3659,Onyx Coffee Stout,4.36,l: pitch black in the glass with a half finger of tan head s: just awesome aroma....very rich coffee without the bitterness. vanilla cream sweetness t: creamy smooth coffee. not too bold very sessionable. f: thin but smooth.
3660,Onyx Coffee Stout,4.01,smell: cold brewed coffee with traces of bitersweet chocolate and french vanilla coffee creamer. taste: cold brewed coffee upfront middle of the mouth hints of roasted malt cherry skin vanilla more cold brewed coffee comes through in the finish and the cherry skin lingers in the aftertaste. feel: light medium body slightly watery creamy extremely easy drinking. overall: if your looking for an easy drinking session coffee stout this is for you. very easy drinking i wouldnt have a hard time putting a few of these back.
3661,Furious,4.17,a better-than-average ipa. barely sweet at first with lingering bitterness. so much better than surlys slightly vomit-y one man mosh pit. ill drink this again.
3662,Furious,4.46,happy to see this arrive in alberta! pours a crystal clear dark copper/amber with two fingers of creamy off white/tawny head. aroma is a wonderful mix of citrus peel grapefruit piney resin and a bit of caramel malt with a floral note. as warmed there is just a hint of weedy dankness. taste follows with sweet caramel malt - a burst of hop flavours - grapefruit peel pine resin some floral flavours and a robust bitterness. medium full mouthfeel bright carbonation and a lingering bright bitterness. just a treat.
3663,Furious,4.1,clear copper with a foamy head that falls into craters. nose and taste generically remind me of a hoppy amber ale with a bit of melanoidin and some metal. that metallic not is something i often get in amber ales especially with a dose of piney hops which furious has a bunch of. it’s evident in the first sip late and moves forward with each sip. the beer overall is a fairly straightforward american bitter beer with a bit of a malt backbone.
3664,Furious,3.97,on tap at whistle binkies in rochester. pours a nice amber/copper colour with a thin ring around the edges.  taste is initially sweeter that quickly fades to a bitter end.
3665,Furious,4.12,12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bar/bottle shop for $3.50. canned on 11/29/22 so this is just under three months old.  look: dark ruby amber color clear. crumbly rocky sticky off-white head.  smell: grapefruit and very earthy woody pine resin. caramel malt backbone. overall the aromas seem to be a bit restrained.  taste: this is a solid beer. up front its pretty tame with a pleasant caramel malt backbone and some grapefruit flavor. then the profile quickly gets aggressively bitter and the finish is full-on grapefruit pith zest and pine resin. the finish is very bitter and very enjoyable. theres just something about the combination and contrast of flavors between grapefruit and darker malts that is so tasty and interesting. this beer takes that flavor profile to the extreme and its pretty cool. over time i get bitterness from roasted malts coming through on the finish also. those roasted malt flavors mimic a coffee bitterness which is pretty cool and this beer also reminds me of like a grapefruit/coffee drink (lacolombe used to make coffee shandies with lemon grapefruit or cherry).  feel: it has a medium plus body chewy mouthfeel. its pretty slick and oily yet it also has a degree of crispness. nicely carbonated.  overall: my second surly brewing company beer (controlled chaos was the first). this beer reminds me a lot of imperial red ales like terrapin big hoppy monster and troegs nugget nectar. i think that if this beer was a bit higher in alcohol then it would fall into that category. and this beer also reminds me a bit of maine beer company zoe which is an american amber / red ale.  from the can/website: india pale ale iconic | hoppy | aggressive year round hops warrior ahtanum cascade simcoe amarillo malt 2-row golden promise aromatic medium crystal roasted barley yeast english ale ibu high color reddish amber og 15º plato  note: my 375th beer review
3666,Furious,4.57,love the caramel notes; excellent balance with the hops
3667,Lone Star Light,3.36,from a can best by 4/10/23. clear golden color with an inch of white fluffy head. smells like straw. light body. tastes of sweet corn and straw. should be rated higher this is a perfectly fine example of the style. clean lager with some adjunct notes crushable if you want to make it a session beer.
3668,Lone Star Light,3.4,first of all the picture of the bottle needs updated.  this is not some great ipa or stout or craft beer. this is good ol lone star light. its great on hot summer day mowing the grass or hanging at the river. its a good light beer if you want to drink light after over doing it the night before.  i drink this when i go to concerts at the clubs here in south texas. you can drink quite a bit and not get fed up.  taste wise its much better than 95% of the light beers out there. starts a bit sweet definite grain notes. its not bitter goes down smooth.  if you want a light easy drinking beer i totally recommend lsl. but im also biased because im from texas.
3669,Lone Star Light,2.75,a very nice lady gave this beer to me as part of a july 4 celebration so i am in a good mood as i write this. the beer is what it is. you have to give it light and refreshing and it tastes pretty good for a light lager. i have had worse. happy 4th!
3670,Lone Star Light,2.91,poured from a bottle into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours a clear straw color with a one finger head of fizzy white foam. the head fades superfast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma of the brew is super light with just a little bit of caramel and malt. along with these smells comes a touch of paper and herb. taste – the taste begins with a light cracker taste matched by a little bit of caramel sweetness. as the taste advances some paper and a touch of herb come to the tongue all while the sweetness increases just a bit to leave one with a still dry but light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is average. the carbonation should be higher for the style to make it more refreshing. overall - it is what it is. i would choose an alternative light lager over this if looking for an easy session.
3671,Lone Star Light,1.77,lone star light is just as musty and grainy as the og lone star with little of the character that makes it so distinctive. it’s just not something i’d drink again if i had a choice. and i do!
3672,Lone Star Light,2.2,out of can in austin texas. not as bad as i thought itd be. tastes like its hydrating? definitely cheap grains maybe corn? kinda thicker texture a tiny bit metallic.
3673,Lone Star Light,3.86,12 oz. bottle poured into tulip (feb. 12 2018 best-by printed on bottle neck)  l: clear yellow srm 2-3 tops and so clear it looks like air in the glass yellow-tinged air; pushes up quickly-dissipating head of white foam that eats at itself like a gose head; bubbles everywhere and they push up a constant fluffy collar and most of a skin; fun to watch; not stick or lace  s: stale grain sour grain yeast everywhere ... loads and loads of dusty yeast; as it warms hints of cracker malt show up subtle and lightly sweet  t: grain stale grain big corn note midswallow through the finish and its not creamed corn but real live corn; lots of yeast; over time it gets some of that american adjunct lager housepaint note many of them have ... hard to describe ... might the yeast mixing with other notes  f: that lightweight/heavy carbonation combination us soda drinkers grew to love; its over carbed of course but i still like it a lot ... helps cleanse the palate  o: the grain flavor is much much more prominent than i expected and while the nose isnt worthy of worldwide acclaim every now and again you can pick up a pinch of barley malt sweetness; for the genre and at 3.85% abv its fantastic. i dont expect much from an american light lager and this one easily surpasses those expectations.
3674,Lone Star Light,1.6,these are cheap and easy to drink. mostly because its water and can hydrate you better than gatorade on a hot summer day. i believe you can only purchase the light version of this beer in texas.
3675,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.71,i like some head on my beers and this one only produced a thin ring of foam around the edge. sticky looking syrup like lace on the glass. chocolate is dominate both on the nose and the pallet. bitter chocolate give it a touch of harshness. not a bad stout just far from being one of my go to brews.
3676,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.09,11.5oz bottle into a pint glass. bottled 12/21/2015 so 7 years old.  mixed look here. jet black body but barely any head.  enticing aroma though. dark fruit molasses think ris light.  on tasting vanilla wafts in and out of a slightly sweet dark fruit flavor. some mild bitter dark chocolate.  mouth medium thinner than would be preferred finish a lasting mild roast.  overall ages nicely. would be interesting to compare with a fresh bottle.
3677,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.21,12 ounce bottle aged in a stout glass.  opaque black with a shallow dark tan cap. a ring wave and dots of lacing.  lots of aromas. vanilla sweet and dark chocolate roasted malt dark fruits brown sugar.  vanilla dark chocolate roasted malt and cocoa flavors.  medium body low carbonation leans sweet.  went well after dinner with some dark chocolate and mexican chocolate cookie.
3678,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.8,341 ml bottle from a quebecois co-worker. abv is 6.5%. black colour low tan head. strong and pleasant aroma of cocoa and vanilla. the flavour is not very sweet but has plenty of cocoa powder and vanilla with strong coffee and bittering hops in the finish. no aphrodisiaque effect detected - maybe i am immune?
3679,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.15,this is my new favourite stout among those that i can buy in my region. at $14 for 4 bottles its so much better than i would have expected. the look is pretty standard for a 7% ish abv stout. dark black with brownish head that leaves a small amount of lacing. the smell on this beer is great i didnt have a bottle opener when i tried it for the first time so i had to whack it on the counter and when some spilled there was this huge rush of vanilla chocolate and beautiful malt. the taste does not quite follow the nose. the complex profile on the nose is lessened significantly when tasting. it is still very cool and the added flavours of vanilla and chocolate are done well enough. the vanilla comes up front but is subtle and the sweetness is balanced well by the roasted malt. the chocolate follows into the aftertaste and is again balanced well by the bitter coffee notes of the roasted malt. the mouthfeel is pretty good. medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation. maybe a little more carbonation would be nice but i like it. overall i used
3680,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.92,appearance: almost black brown smell: malt port coffee taste: coffee vanilla chocolate dark dry fruits malt mouthfeel: low carbonation overall: a tasty stout with pronounced flavours that complement each other well
3681,Sosus,3.66,22oz bottle - review from notes  ive been meaning to get my hands on this one. a double ipa from one of my favorite ipa-making breweries. and this doesnt disappoint with massive pine and floral notes. smells (and tastes?) like a bottle of pine-sol  great stuff
3682,Sosus,3.9,a: medium haziness of orange for coloring with a white soapy foam composition of one inch. sticky strands of lacing. strong carbonation factor.  s: really sweet sugary peaches watermelon and guava. a bit of strawberry-lemonade. good strength. has a bit of juicy gatorade flair.  t: dry flowery hopping citrus and orange grind with a bready malting.  m: bready malty consistency for mouthful.  o: overall loved the nose fruity and berry like fresh wet and gatorade like. the flavor was a bit less impressing less complexed and basic.
3683,Coors Light,2.73,refreshing summer classic. not even my wifes bazoongas can bring me as much joy as the sight of blue mountains beckoning me to take another delicious swig of colorados finest brewed liquid.
3684,Coors Light,2.67,from a can best by 9/11/23. clear golden color with an inch of foamy white head. sweet grain aroma. light body with prickly carbonation. grain and corn with a bit of a floral note on the finish. an ok beer crisp and refreshing but not much going on. the advertising is not wrong - you dont want to let this beer warm up. its best right out of the fridge.
3685,Coors Light,2.88,better than water.
3686,Coors Light,2.36,look: pale yellow and crystal clear with a sudsy white head that builds to the rim and quickly and noisily settles to a film leaving minimal lacing behind aroma: corn straw cereal grains and muted but slightly detectable floral hop notes. honestly there isn’t much going on here taste: starts out with cereal grains and straw but with a watered down taste to it before wafts of spotty floral hop notes peek in occasionally. corn comes on in the second act and lingers before grains and water close it out mouthfeel: light and watery clean medium-high carbonation and a clean and crisp finish overall: what can i say – it’s coors light. the watered down sibling of the banquet beer is exactly that and doesn’t bring much to the table aroma nor taste-wise although refreshing on a hot day when your thirsty. i would and do pick a ton of non-light aal’s over this when the occasion calls
3687,Coors Light,1.1,what do this beer and having sex in a boat have in common?  they’re both f@&king close to water.
3688,Coors Light,3.1,i enjoy this beer.
3689,Coors Light,2.08,not the worst option out there
3690,Coors Light,2.07,its beer at least.
3691,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.39,9.5% on the bottle.  upon opening up this bottle it gushed and lost nearly half the bottle. not sure as to quality control with this one.  appearance - pours a copper brown with a finger of bubbly white head.  smell - fruity esters of raisin plum and fig low spicy hops toffee malts caramel and earthy yeast.  taste - fruity esters of raisin plum and fig upfront but not potent enough for the style. the hint of spicy hops come through next. the toffee malts caramel and earthy yeast round out the brew. the flavours are not that potent which is very dissapointing.  mouthfeel - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. finishes a tad thin.  overall - a disappointing brew that started off on the wrong foot. nearly loosing half the beer due to gushing is a terrible sign of this brewerys quality control. perhaps this was an off-bottle.
3692,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.71,1.5 liter magnum bottle rbesg 2005 grand tasting. abv was 10%. intense oaky and malty aroma. flavour is also intensely oaky and moderately sweet. i probably drank it too warm will need to rerate when available at cellar temperature. as it was it’s not my definite favourite but obviously a well crafted beer.
3693,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.12,lable has changed its now more text + subtle pared back indigo blue graphics on white than that pictured in the headers. abv is marked as 9.5% instead of the 9.0% in the headers. front lable reads: brasserie des rocs grand cru belgian special brown ale. l- pours very rich intense chestnut brown clear though i see now some minor sediment was left in the bottle. 3mm pale tan head. s- pungent deep roasted fruits. reminds me of british xmas pudding. this is a good sign ime touch wood. t- the smell follows into the taste plus a little more somewhat dry and toasty edge on top. perhaps thats what differentiates this from a belgian tripel which at this abv% id expect to be much richer. f- pungent quite a hefty feel. somewhat dry for a 9.5% though i notice in the subtle little lick of hoppy zing i get on my tongue/palate as i swallow. i think its cleverly balanced. o- nice. it has a power and one that is quite reined in for 9.5% nothing leaps out and beats you over the head. nothing at all strikes me as at all out of balance. very drinkable and id happily drink it again. this style would work best for me in colder months.... visions of kicking back and slow-sipping a couple of these in front of a log fire that maybe one day ill own :) bought from belgianinabox (antwerp/be) for delivery to me in london/uk. 330ml bottle: bb: 25/02/2022
3694,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.56,pours a hazelnut brown color with a huge stable eggshell colored head.  smells of milk chocolate green peppers allspice and anise. quite forward on the spices this manages to establish a balancing herbal hop presence on the nose providing an intriguing depth.  has a soft medium bodied mouthfeel with a fitting lighter effervescence during its finish.  has a soft almost aqueous beginning followed up by bakers chocolate cardamom and glazed toffee together with a light note of dried leaves. those produce a pleasant dryness feathering the overall malt sweetness in this a bit allowing for spicy licorice and a whiff of milk chocolate to cut through. finishes with even more spicy chewy licorice and sweeter turning chocolate among rock sugar and very light noble hops.  quite pleasant with a great mouthfeel to it this provides a classic belgian sweetness with a satisfying depth to it.
3695,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.54,listed as 9.5% on label and as brasserie des rocs. normal quad dried fruit aromas and flavors abrupt finish cloying sweetness. i had hoped for better based on the overall score.
3696,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.28,best before feb 18 2020 - this version is 9.5% abv - enjoyed (canadian) thanksgiving 2019. pours a coppery deep caramel brown with abundant cream coloured head with orangey highlights - clear but significant debris from a ? poorly poured bottle. sweet caramel toffee yeasty belgian spices raisin brown sugar and a bit of booziness on the nose. taste follows - delicious caramel belgian spice toffee dark fruits a touch of booze on a backbone of malty sweetness. medium bodied but briskly carbonated leading to a creamy deliciously sweet finish the floating debris was a bit unnerving but else this was fantastic.
3697,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.32,pours a murky brown color with a medium top off beige head that dissolves quickly. aroma is of caramel toffeecocoa bread dark and dried fruits anis vanilla and spices. getting a christmas cake feel off the aroma. the flavour follows the nose. sweet with dark and dried fruit notes and strong malt notes innen the back with nice notes off caramel dark bread and cocoa . it then gets more hints off spices in the flavour before finishing with some slight bitter notes balanced nicely with the malt background. nice strenght and lenght in the aftertaste. mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a full body and a soft carbonation. with two words: really delicious.
3698,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,3.98,on tap at monk’s cafe. strong dark ale is right.
3699,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.25,bottle purchased at fattey beer co in rochester ny. 2022 vintage best before 2025.  this one pours a dark golden brown color with a small head and a little lacing.  this smells like spiced bread dried plums and raisins molasses and herbal hops.  this is a pretty standard but very well done belgian dark strong ale. there’s not too much in the way of spicing - light clove and a general warming spice character along with a malt note that’s reminiscent of molasses and baked bread. there’s just a touch of slightly bitter hop character.  this is medium bodied creamy and with no real booziness to it.  this feels pretty classic and i enjoyed it a lot.
3700,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,3.59,purchased at vintage cellar in blacksburg va. drank in my hotel room so had to pour it into a small clear plastic solo cup. bottle info: best before: 8/6/25 t9 13:20 can’t believe i’ve never had this beer.  this beer may label itself as a christmas ale but don’t let your dislike of xmas ales keep you from trying this one. the xmas/winter ale spice is very low. this is a nice but not exceptional belgian dark ale. complex but not what i would call a rich tasting beer. too much bitterness for the style in my opinion. 3.5  a – pours clear dark amber with a huge tannish mousey head. opaque in the glass. excellent lacing some of the best i have ever seen. 4.5  s – generally lacking an aroma. what is present is malty with faint xmas spices of clove and nutmeg. no sweetness pepperiness or dried fruit. 3.0  t – malty slightly spicey brown bread no sweetness some minor dried fruit some vinous red wine like astringency and an herbal bitterness in the finish. alcohol is not evident. 3.75  mf – medium heavy body with a surprisingly dry finish. not particularly smooth slick or coating. slightly thin for the style. carbonation is good with some sharpness on the tongue. 4.0
3701,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.83,smells of jammy dark breads with some spice. poured a long lasting thin off white head. taste is amazing. complex. too hard to describe. great beer. highly recommend.
3702,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.41,very typical color for a belgian strong ale. head is tan to dark tan. nose is malty. taste reminds me of hoarhound candy from my childhood with a slight boozy kick. also get a malty taste. very good beer.
3703,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.52,1 pint 9.4 ounce bottle best before date 08/08/25 christmas 2022 malty bready spicy dried cherries smooth 8.1% abv warms but is quite well hidden. this is a true winner really a wonderful brown ale.
3704,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.27,look: it pours brown with excellent clarity. it has a light brown head with very good head retention.  smell: it has sweet malty aromas up front with plum and cherry elements. it tends to be a little bit rose like with medium light spices.  taste: it has a malty sweetness to it up front with plum raisin and cherry elements. there is a bit of flower like background note with a bit of spice.  feel: it has high carbonation with a smooth texture. the alcohols are noticeable but at a pleasant level. it has a medium body.  overall plenty of bold complex aromas and flavors with plums raisins and cherries be the feature.
3705,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.21,bottle with bb date 08/06/25 let sit out for 10 minutes before opening.  clear dark reddish-brown with about 1 1/2 fingers of very fine light tan head. the head is very long-lasting  and maintains surface coverage for the duration and produces some thin lacing whenever the glass is move.  smell is a vague mix of dried fruit and a little bit of biscuity malt aroma. a hint of spiciness when swirled.  taste is raisin fig prune leather with a bit of light spice (coriander+pepper+allspice) towards finish.  feel is medium lightly-sticky initially followed by moderate carbonation tingle finishing (again) lightly sticky leaving the tongue feeling coated.  nice one. a classic for a reason. :) had it before but appreciating it even more with analysis.
3706,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.13,11.2oz bottle into a goblet. best by 8/6/25.  looks very good in the glass. dark reddish brown body with a strong off white head which retains well leaving a sheet of lacing.  smooth malty aroma with the barest hint of fruit.  on tasting smooth malty dark strong(ish) so easy to drink belying the 8.1abv.  mouth full finish slightly warming with a featherlight bitter touch.  overall really nice easy drinking though strong winter ale. happy to have another 3 in reserve.
3707,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,3.82,best before 8-6-25. 11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip.  pours mahogany with ruby hues; big fluffy and creamy light khaki head that falls slowly leaving great retention and sticky lacing.  the aromas have a subtle blend of malts and yeasts. some caramel coming through along with some banana. some toast as well.  the flavors basically follow the nose for the most part. lots of toast. more caramel and banana. some bubblegum. some cocoa and chocolate. some raisins and dark fruits. subtle bitterness to go with a subtle sweetness. yeasts do their thing. solid malt backbone. finishes clean. alcohol is well hidden.  mouthfeel is nice and what you would expect from a belgian beer. its medium to full-bodied with active carbonation. its sharp spritzy smooth fluffy and slightly creamy.  this is a solid dark belgian brew. it has everything that youd expect from the style more or less. its not flashy but the craftsmanship is on point and takes this one to the next level. i like it.
3708,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.26,333 ml bottle best before date: 08/06/25 glass: chalice/goblet (which is which?) abv: 8.1% temp: 50.5 f   look: dark but clear mahogany that appears almost chestnut until held to light. a dense and creamy 1-finger high khaki head tops things off. the head fills what is left of the glass after the beer has been poured and the head stays. and stays. and stays. with hardly any degradation. lacing is excellent once room for it has been made.  aroma: a captivating note of soft spices such as cinnamon nutmeg very light cloves and star anise. there are also notes of dark brown sugar and some dark and/or dried fruits like raisin currants prunes plums and some figs. also faint notes of other fruits such as ripe bananas. a nice malty scent is also in there but underneath everything else and hiding in the background.  taste: bready malts that are deep and somewhat dark. the spices and fruits from the aroma are here and the spices are amped up a notch. these are joined by some citrus and orange peel and by some notes that are reminiscent of a port wine. there is a moderate but restrained bitterness throughout the sip that balances things out quite well. the sip finishes a bit dry and mildly spicy. and even a very slight touch tart.  feel: crisp but also smooth with a touch of creaminess. the body is medium-light.  overall: a very nice bds christmas ale. solid in all aspects. i think that i just may add this to my christmas rotation.
3709,Corsendonk Christmas Ale,5,super great beguin christmas ale ! this one will be hard to beat. i bought a 4 pack for $9.99 ! high abv great taste super reasonable price ! my new favorite ! btw i poured it into my mouth and didnt take the time to smell or feel it ! if you have that much time god bless !
3710,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.04,12 oz can from total wine and more in short pump va this is a one-of-a-kind ale along with sculpin. a go-to beer for all times. the ale pours a clear amber with a white foamy head and lacing. the noticeable aroma is citrus mostly grapefruit is nicely balanced. the mouthfeel is smooth with excellent body and texture. the ale has a medium body with average carbonation.
3711,Sculpin - Grapefruit,3.03,yet another beer that has been destroyed by being bought out? pour is deep copper to light amber much deeper than i recall back in the day. decent hop notes and some light lacing. this is fresh beer yet offers no grapefruit notes that existed in the past. taste is a bit malty subdued pleasant yet unexciting. pleasant hop character on the nose yet not stellar finish is fairly soft for an ipa lacking the bitterness it is known for. warming does bring out just a hint of grapefruit though it is fleeting at best. touch of hop spice on the close. a decent quaff but heading into the not worth the calories realm of once great beers. who owns this brand now? i dont know and they dont care. utopia is behind us...
3712,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.83,this beer is impossible to get hold off where i live. it’s truly excellent and enhances the flavors of the sculpin with slightly sour but more refreshing notes.
3713,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.15,my shock and horror to see that after all these years i hadnt reviewed sculpin grapefruit! well no more. i love this beer as grapefruit is a lovely way to compliment the biting hops of sculpin. not for amateurs or posers and bmc drinkers heads will aspolode upon the first sip. similarly to arrogant bastard keep this one away from the unsophisticated newbies.
3714,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.56,had to have while visiting san diego. perfect west coast ipa to drink while on the west coast. perfect amount of grapefruit and perfect sipability to the whole brew
3715,Sculpin - Grapefruit,5,not much to say... beer like this makes me hoppy! absolutely delicious! smell taste body is all 10/10
3716,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.04,12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a mix-a-six pack for $2. pkg 07apr22 so this is almost four months old.  look: pours a very pretty copper color. almost completely clear; just a very faint haze that appeared after i poured the bottom of the can. there was a thick rocky off-white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.  smell: i definitely smell the grapefruit aroma up front. it smells nice. other fruity caramelly and herbal/vegetal notes but nothing distinctive besides grapefruit. after delving into it i can detect nice apricot and orange zest aromas.  taste: its very tasty. up front theres grapefruit flavor with a bit of acidity. the mild gentle initial grapefruit flavor explodes into an oily bitter pithy profile that attacks the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate. the finish is long piney resinous and bitter with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. eventually i can detect a pleasant caramel malt sweetness after the bitterness subsides. even though this beer is so bitter i feel like there is an element of balance to it because along theres also a lot of caramel malt to help counteract the strong bitterness.  feel: medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. someone oil slightly chewy mouthfeel.  overall: this has got to be one of the quintessential west coast ipas. i tried regular sculpin ipa many years ago and i was utterly unprepared for how bitter it was. this is also very bitter and i think that my palate has adjusted over the years and now embraces bitterness. this beer requires a palate adjustment for many folks and thats okay because many folks palates (and minds) need to be adjusted! its also nice to see that this beer can hold up to father time; at almost four months old its still very aromatic and flavorful.  grapefruit sculpin india pale ale with natural grapefruit flavors
3717,Sculpin - Grapefruit,1.36,i found the taste to be completely unpalatable. way too bitter not very smooth. hated it
3718,Raspberry Eisbock,4.19,(375 ml bottle 2022 vintage; purchased cold at the brewery last week... poured into tulip glasses)  pours a touch cloudy; red-brown liquid little foaming... raspberry juice dominant with a touch of brown bread on the nose; mellow expression of perfumy brandy-like booze... on the palate: notably booze-forward but not quite vinous-like; raspberry-dominant but never even moderately sweet; the fruit and base beer seem to fight for contrast a muddy affair that thankfully opens up and gains more depth over the course the journey through the glass... textures: lager-like clean finish body attenuated in part by the hefty strength; warmer the flow starts to develop a delicate roundness but the palate is repeatedly stunned by hot flashes of ethanol... grateful for finally having tried this; while it does offer some interesting sensations its taste leaves much to be desired; i would definitely try their other flavored eisbocks regardless (2191)
3719,Raspberry Eisbock,3.66,brownish red murky body cream colored head. smell has that rustic boozy raspberry aroma leading slight almost toasty yeast and sweet malt supporting. taste is raspberry cough syrup with light booze backing the aftertaste is reminiscent of homemade schnapps in the mountains. feel is light and smooth but has that booze burn on the finish which is typical for style honestly big sugars add to this burn though. i have had better eisbock the fruit here didnt add anything for me if anything the sweetness knocked the balance of the beer further out of kilter
3720,Raspberry Eisbock,4.25,06/04/23 bottle @ home
3721,Raspberry Eisbock,3.76,2007 vintage. 6.3oz. bottle / 13.8% abv. pours a deep claret hue with no head. nose expresses an abundance of raspberry (surprising given the age) as well as a hint cocoa in the background. taste consistent with nose; however oxidation has definitely set in and there are some vinegar notes at the finish. mouthfeel is light in body with a still carbonation. overall interesting and still complex despite being past it’s prime.
3722,Raspberry Eisbock,4.47,purchased this one at the brewery and muled it back home in my luggage. no abv on the bottle. 12.7oz bottle capped and waxed (red wine colored). poured into a small-stemmed tulip.  i love this beer. the oxidation is what struck me at first but the raspberry makes more of an impression as the session continues. 4.5  a – pours a dark amber with a wine impression. clear with a very small tannish head that disappears quickly leaving a ring around the glass. average lacing and good viscosity on the glass. looks like an old ale. 4.5  s – raspberries but not overwhelming. some vinous qualities and oxidation like an old ale. no noticeable hops. 4.25  t – the abv is slightly noticeable. raspberry is faint and much less than perceived in the aroma. very wine-like. no noticeable bitterness. faintly sweet which only adds to the taste and the drinkability. 4.5  mf – medium bodied with a semi-dry finish. some very minor astringency and even some citric acid at the end. 4.75
3723,Raspberry Eisbock,4.42,2016 vintage  now this is a beer i’ve wanted for a long time. kuhnhenn doesn’t distribute out in mass so i’m thrilled to finally get my hands on this the highest rated eisbock on ba. eisbock is a style i’d love to find more of in general but one this highly regarded is exciting. let’s pop it open  pours a muddy brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  wow the nose on this is incredibly expressive and spirit driven it’s so complex. i’m picking up on aromas of tart jammy raspberry cherry cordial milk chocolate sweet caramel port wine brown bread raisin nutty malt and sticky molasses  it loses its tart edge in taste and maybe that’s a function of its age but it is still complex and tasty. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting jammy raspberry cocoa powder brown sugar sweet wine fig and brown bread. the swallow brings notes of cherry cordial cocoa powder port wine sticky molasses jammy raspberry toffee and earthy wood  a medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a boozy and slick beer. finishes neutral with a little tingle but drinks well below the listed 15.5%  while the taste was lacking a bit this was still a fantastic beer! i definitely need to get my hands on a fresh bottle some day. it is very close to a liqueur or just a straight up raspberry filled chocolate but the complexity sets it apart
3724,Raspberry Eisbock,4.43,poured from a 375ml bottle into a snifter. pours a murky dirty ruby red with a finger of sandy brown foam head. raspberries aplenty on the nose. a tinge of chocolate malt and even a faint whiff of alcohol burn. more raspberries on the taste with a lovely chocolate and malty background. not that there is anything wrong with the nose but the flavors are so much more complex than the aromas would lead you to believe. really smooth for such a high abv. thick full mouthfeel. very hard to tell this one is 15%. it’s a sipper for sure and while it carrie’s qualities of old ales and doppelbocks alike it drinks like an 8% fruited stout. really interesting style of beer. hope to try more of this style.
3725,Raspberry Eisbock,4.2,2017 vintage enjoyed on 12/16/2021. low carbonation medium body alcohol extremely well hidden at 15+%. sweet ripe raspberries front and center with bittersweet dark chocolate undertones.
3726,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.51,poured from a can into a snifter. pours hazy orange yellow with a small white head. smells of citrus and grassy hops with floral notes. tastes of bright citrus with some creamy notes. beer is medium bodied with a nice smooth finish good carbonation. overall a superb beer.
3727,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.52,look - bright hazy orange with a nice white head sticky rimming and lacing smell - tropical fruit and slightly floral taste - floral peach and citrus tangerine with a slight floral and sweetness feel - medium full body fluffy creamy... medium carbonation overall - really fantastic ipa wish the smell was a little more but still fantastic
3728,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,4.9,#148 yummy!
3729,Hommage,4.47,375ml green bottle. corked and caged. label has the bottling date as 07/01/2020 and good until 10/26/2040. final dregs clouded up the dark cherry red body. brief fizzy head but rising bubbles keep trying to form a ring. no lacing. aroma of raspberry cherry oak funk and a little barley and wheat grain. taste is tart with raspberry cherry and oak funk. some level of sweetness too. underlay of barley and wheat malt. quick exit in the aftertaste. medium mouth feel with a bit of nectar. drying finish and some tooth scraping (acidic). supportive carbonation. the oak aging has resulted in an excellent blend of raspberry and cherry along with the fermented malts. all exist on a naturally higher plane.
3730,Hommage,4.25,bottle share at temperance street with a bottle that wasn’t poured by myself pours a rose reddish body aroma is full turkish delight flavour is dry dry dryness
3731,Hommage,4.74,blend 75. season 17/18. tart moderately acidic. big raspberry flavor on top of that classic lambic funk. delicious.
3732,Hommage,3.7,a: pours purple/blood red color. a small pink/white head forms initially. though that recedes quickly with little lace. that color is really stunning though. s: aromatic and tart berries and cherries up front and center. with an unmistakable earthy funk. there is a bit of oak and vanilla here as well. a really pungent and sharp aroma that i enjoy. t: oh boy that sweet tart berry/cherry mix is there. which becomes super acidic and sour. that funk light oak and vanilla is there as well. which tries to help balance. though that acidic sourness becomes a little to much and makes this unbalanced for me. m/o: a medium body that has a nice crisp bite. really well carbonated. definitely some sweetness as would be expected but finishes with a dry bite as well. pretty classic for the style but still its slow going. that acidity takes over to much.  i love 3 fonteinen and this is a good example of the style for sure. though it is unbalanced for me. there are other fruit lambics that i prefer over this but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make and i do enjoy it. just not love it as much as others in the style or even others from this same brewery. i would recommend this if you enjoy intense flavors especially sour acidic cherries.
3733,Hommage,5,blend no 71 season 18/19. perfect just perfect!
3734,Guinness Draught,5,why didnt i try this sooner? poured into a guinness glass it was a peaceful moment watching the bubbles settle. first sip bitter like a good coffee and dark chocolate. smelled of roasted coffee beans. rich in flavor mouthfeel creamy and smooth. not heavy easy on the stomach. it was so good i had another. one day ill enjoy a proper pour until then this is a staple in the fridge.
3735,Guinness Draught,4.2,the nitro draught in a can is the best version not from a tap and is in regular rotation at my house particularly during the colder months. i dont really like the heaviness or bitterness of other stouts and dislike the sweetness of porters but this version guinness is very smooth and clean tasting.
3736,Guinness Draught,4.68,amazing beer when from draft of a can less so from a bottle but still solid.
3737,Guinness Draught,4.68,love it no other words
3738,Guinness Draught,5,pint in the long haul dublin. decided to base my rating off the better pints i have had(of many!). at its best its unrivalled. creamy bitter dry. pure heaven.
3739,Guinness Draught,3.77,appearance: served from both a 14.9 nitro can and more impressively a tap/keg poured into a chilled guinness pint glass. the tap/keg service in particular accentuates the beers visual appeal. it presents an even more impressive creamy head that intriguingly billows down to the bottom of the glass a spectacle that is delightfully captivating. after a 90 second wait the drinking begins. whether from the can or tap the beverage exhibits heavy lacing and a long-lasting head. however the visual drama of the pour is distinctly amplified when served from the tap.  scent: the nose is greeted by the aromas of roasted barley and coffee.  taste: the flavor profile carries over the scents of roasted barley and coffee but also introduces notes of chocolate fruity yeast and a gentle hop presence to maintain freshness. though not complex it is extremely well-balanced. despite a low grain bill the fruitiness of the yeast and the smoothness provided by the nitro infusion alleviate any harshness from the roasted barley. the beer is surprisingly easy to drink.  mouthfeel: the upfront creaminess from the nitro-infused head contrasts nicely with the light and slightly watery texture due to the low grain bill. this brew is easy to drink refreshingly light and quite popular in warm-climate countries.  overall: this is a well-crafted light stout that is not only refreshing but also sessionable. it has become my go-to beer for st. patricks day and beyond given the nitros gentleness on the lower urinary tract symptoms (luts). indeed guinness seems to be onto something - i might start finishing some of my homebrews on nitro.  this light stout\s low grain profile can lead to variable harshness of flavor if not consumed fresh. guinness on tap/keg presents a superior taste and creamier feel featuring the nitro/carbonation twang without the excess harshness of the roasted barley which can come off as an ashtray taste in cans. think of it like the difference between freshly brewed coffee (on tap) and coffee that\s been sitting on heat for a while (cans).  overall scores: nitro can: 3.25 on tap/keg: 4.00
3740,Schaefer Light,3.25,jeez the snobbery. i love a gourmet $20 burger with hand cut organic potatoes fried in duck fat but of course there is a time and place for a quick/greasy/cheap fast food combo. not gonna review a dollar menu cheeseburger it from my imaginary throne in the sky opining about my disappointment in the lack of organic butter lettuce and raw cheddar.  reviewing a beer like this from the same vantage as a boutique microbrew is absolutely silly and pretentious. this is a blue collar beer that isn’t pretending to be otherwise.  you want a cheap light session beer that serves the same purpose as an ice cold sprite? look no further. when frigid it’s super refreshing and easy to drink. that’s the point. nice medium carbonation. no aftertaste no funk no dimension just how i like it when i’m moving the mower from the front to back yard or changing the way overdue oil on my wife’s car.
3741,Schaefer Light,3.62,the one beer to have when youre having more than one.
3742,Schaefer Light,5,oneof the bet light beers i have had..like it!
3743,Schaefer Light,4.42,it goes down like water a crisp no aftertaste beer... its not the best but it was the first beer i ever drank age 11 lol... nostalgia! its the beer my dad drank until it was rolled out and no longer available at your everyday corner store... man do i miss this beer...
3744,Schaefer Light,2,a-pours a golden color with a slight head and lacing a-aroma has lemongrass hints t-the taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor m-a light bodied well carbonated beer o-a decent beer
3745,Schaefer Light,3.28,its silly to attempt a philosophical description or review about this beer or any other in its class. if you are buying it there is a reason and that reason is you are looking for a good value beer. schaefer light is an excellent value beer.  do you really care what it looks like when its poured? why would you even be pouring this beer?? drink it straight from the can on a hot summer day.  like most every other macro or american adjunct the aroma is grain sweet some corn.  the taste is where schaefer light shines above its brethren. it leaves absolutely no aftertaste at all finishing clean and crisp. extremely clean absolutely refreshing. medium carbonation great mouthfeel and completely enjoyable.  i know its cliche or chic to say how much of this you consumed in college when your tastes were unrefined or that its the worst beer in existence but schaefer light is actually a great tasting refreshing value beer perfect for a 90 degree day or when you want to put many back and dont feel like crushing a huge ipa with an abv over 8. very enjoyable.
3746,Juicy,4.41,l -- surprisingly amber-brown body with two fingers of white head produced with moderate pour. some retention and good lacing. s -- definitely dry hopped! some nice tropical notes along with a somewhat unpleasant medicinal note almost like pepto bismol. also getting oak mixed berry and subtle barnyard funk. i like it more as it warms t -- the name is pretty spot on here: this is surprisingly candy-like. not overly tart but there is some distinct lemon peel character. great balance between hoppy and funky. f -- crisp effervescent eminently drinkable o -- definitely my favorite of the dry-hopped hf saisons  89/100
3747,Juicy,4.47,bottled on february 14 2020. pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. aroma is excellent. a combination of wine barrels orange lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. maybe a little bit of tart funk but it definitely takes a back seat.  on the tongue the funk is much more present. the taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. mid palate i get some tropical notes along with wildflowers. i dont believe any dandelions are in this beer but to me it tastes like they are. on the very long finish the funk has more of an earthy feel. surprisingly full body. well carbonated and smooth despite a bit of acidity.  overall this is an excellent beer. complex and layered in a way i dont often see. the barrels really add to the experience. an excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine.
3748,Red Fang,3.61,cosmic tiger edition. light golden body. sweeter malt has a good bit of bread and grain. not particularly hoppy or balanced just a big sweet malty lager. lighter medium bodied good carbonation finishes a bit dry and a touch perfume-y.  weekender edition. clear golden body. crisp crackery malt. a touch of grainy malt sweetness. more balanced than cosmic tiger. mild floral bite. smooth good crisp carbonation. not anywhere near hoppy as czaf but would be a damn good aal if labeled so.
3749,Red Fang,3.36,pours a crystal clear golden color. quite effervescent initially with a thin weak sudsy white head. the effervescence lightens as it sits but it remains somewhat effervescent throughout. aroma has notes of sweet grain corn wonder bread with a light sweetness.  taste is sweet with notes of corn grain wonder bread a subtle bitter hop note with some fusel alcohol like notes. its pretty sweet with a malty sweetness that actually ends up lingering on the palate. feel is smooth thicker and somewhat slick. mild carboantion. kind of dry on this finish.  overall this is actually pretty decent - its sweet and grainy but actually tastes halfway decent. i would actually willingly drink this again.
3750,Red Fang,3.59,19.2 oz can from tavour. clear golden pour small white head. aroma is sweet grainy malts. mild fruity flavors accent the smell. slick slippery feel.
3751,Red Fang,3.79,a: the beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. it poured with a short white head that quickly died down leaving a narrow collar around the edge of glass. s: moderate aromas of sweet malts and notes of fusel alcohol are present in the nose. t: the taste follows the smell but the aromas and flavors are a bit more subdued. m: it feels just about medium-bodied and somewhat clean on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. o: this beer is quite good for the style. while it has some notes to hints of fusel alcohol these arent overly strong.  serving type: can
3752,Red Fang,3.68,19.2oz can into a pint glass. canned 6/1/21 so 5 weeks old.  looks nice in the glass. crystal clear golden body with good carbonation. small bright white head doesnt last though hence no lacing.  not much on the nose just a little sweet malt.  on tasting very malty quite sweet a light dryness even faint heat from the relatively low abv.  mouth right around medium finish sweet with the faintest of bitter notes but spoiled by a light metallic touch.  overall not bad dont get to try this style too often so kudos to wayfinder for putting it out. since i am an aging coot i have no idea who red fang are.
3753,Red Fang,4,so here raul is drinking some malt liquor just after midday (and you know i wouldn’t have it any other way).  anyway this one is pretty shocking - like santa tripping over the chord to the christmas tree and starting an electrical fire “shocking.” yeah it’s wild and good like the groundhog who came out of the hole early. i mean it simply just tastes good. and that’s good. for raul. cuz raul likes good things.  see ya.
3754,Red Fang,3.47,19oz can  pours a finger of dense white head into a rastal kolsch glass a little fizzy and it fades within a couple minutes. initial lacing looks poor. body is pale yellow crystal clear with a medium amount of bubbles coming up. looks par for the course so far.  nose is certainly a little sweet. corn but some bready notes as well. a touch of caramel. not a lot going on but who could expect that. not bad works for a weekender.  flavor is pretty robust. it’s been a long time since i’ve had an actual malt liquor but i can’t imagine they usually have this much flavor. that being said it also comes with an elevated sweetness and good amount of corn; what malts are here do a nice job of keeping things on planet earth. its a bit much at times but what malt liquor isnt.  carbonation is medium. body is quite thick for a lager. sweetness is noticeable but not cloying. bitterness is not evident at first comes out with time. while it teeters on being a little too sweet it doesnt cross that line and the big body is a nice touch.  drinkability is pretty good considering its not light at all. mild alcohol comes out as it warms and that does slow me down a bit.  appearance turned out poor no surprise there zero lacing.  overall its not a beer i can say tastes high quality i mean it’s by definition full of adjuncts. all things considered though its not bad pretty clean other than the sweetness.
3755,Red Fang,3.59,can from abv.  a clear straw yellow with a quickly receding white head this looks decent. the nose is delicately sweet with a definite grain character no corn no hops. the palate opens delicately sweet and grainy a clear malt flavor grainy mildly sugary and clean. very mild bitterness on the finish with more sweetness present. light but not watery crisp clean and quite drinkable.
3756,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.33,this is a tame ipa but i like it well enough. id be happy to drink it a party at which i didnt pay for it. :) haha! thats not a bash its just a very inoffensive and not rebellious form of the style that has a more pronounced malt profile and a balanced and tame hope bite.  sure if you are not an ipa drinker you may notice what might be perceived as a strong hop presence giving it the typical citrus and pine notes. it does pour a golden color with a frothy head creating an inviting appearance so theres also that...put it in a glass and church it up baby!!  the standout features of this beer is its balance. despite the high hop content it manages to maintain a smooth and drinkable flavor that i think makes it very middling in the true sense of the word but not necessarily in a bad way.  the bitterness is well-matched with a malty sweetness creating a harmonious flavor profile. this beer is perfect for those who enjoy a strong and hoppy ipa without overpowering the senses  a brewery that made its name not making hoppy beers has made one that i think is aligned with their overall portfolio. i can appreciate this as their ipa not the prototypical american or wc ipa this is a sam adams ipa and its good!
3757,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.82,this beer is way more balanced than your typical ipa. the first note was more malt than hops which was interesting. bread and toasted malt. then the hops. floral slightly earthy a bitnof pine. balance is the big word here. super drinkable. a go-to beer for sure.
3758,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,4,a lighter ipa that i think works well as a tasty refresher.
3759,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.63,poured a couple of brown 12 oz. bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation. its a light bright copper color with emphasis on light. rather translucent more than colorful maybe the head and lacing will compensate. no theres little of either there. the lacing outperforms but not by much. its not aromatic neither. ok now for the taste the big category. unfortunately nothing to rave about here. its pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. the body is a little thin and the hops arent bitter enough but theyre there. if ever there was an ipa intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers this is it. not at all rebellious it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard american lager. likely the best choice at national chain restaurants.
3760,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.87,12/11/14: appearance: clear bright golden hue long-lasting bone white head looking good.  aroma: fresh and lively hop aromatics screaming with citrus and tropical fruits bristling with pine and grass. green as it gets.  taste: brisk hop bite at the front soft and mellow from there on out. light bodied but with a long bitter hop finish. exquisite drinkability but for hop-heads only. bitter hop resins lay long on the palate providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids.  a very nice rendition of this popular style but its not just not landing on the top tier im afraid. a few steps short.  wait. i just noticed something. the box reads: enjoy before dec. 2014. no specific date given. this was purchased in early december 2014. i always see a lot of these cases at the store i bought it at i\m guessing it\s not that popular for whatever reason. maybe if i\d bought it earlier it would taste fresher and i\d see higher up on that tier…maybe...  what\s the paper on the bottle say? rebel ipa is brewed with 5 varieties of west coast hops: cascade simcoe centennial chinook & amarillo it\s everything we love about west coast-style ipas big citrus & grapefruit flavors with subtle pine notes for a flavorful refreshing brew.
3761,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.83,pours golden yellow with a 3/4 inch white head. moderate lacing.  aroma is grassy piney fruity cedar.  tastes of pine grapefruit earth resinous.  medium bodied light carbonation. semi-dry finish.  lower carbonation than i expect from an ipa. bottled 12/19. may be past its prime. still a good beer.
3762,JJJuiceee Machine,4.48,a - pours a deep orange with a two finger creamy white head. nice amount of soapy lacing.  s - aroma is mango orange cantaloupe grapefruit and catty hops.  t - the taste is mango orange cantaloupe honeydew lime and a piney bitter finish.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. creamy mouthfeel with a soft crisp finish.  o - another tree house banger.
3763,JJJuiceee Machine,4.62,mine says 8.2% abv es machts nichts  pours a super hazed gold/homey color with one finger of eggshell colored head. sheets of lacing & good head retention  s: oranges peaches guava  t: follows the nose papaya green melon dryness & cantaloupe up front just a touch of grapefruit. papaya green melon tangerine as this beer warms up a little bit of cherry lime-aid as well finishes dry with some tang orange notes pineapple more cherry lime-aid & kiwi fruit  mf: medium body fairly soft carbonation great juiciness/balance some acidic notes  this totally brings the flavor & the juice. so thrilled to have the chance to try it
3764,JJJuiceee Machine,4.71,look - thick hazy milky tannsih orangish yellow with a thick white head lacing and thick rimming. other than it being darker than expected fantastic smell - big tropical juice mango heavy followed by citrus orange and dank taste - sweet tropical dank juices. mango orange and resin feel - medium full body with a medium light carb slight creamy overall - really fantastic!
3765,JJJuiceee Machine,4.6,pouring that ubiquitous tree house turbid hazy color (in this case orange) the creamy off white head coats the glass as you drink the beer?  how do they do that every single time? anyway the nose is a citrus juice lover’s delight with slabs of mango ripe oranges and passion fruit assaulting your olfactory senses. incredible.  the taste is simply the nose on ped’s with the mango leading the citrus deployment for the ripe orange and passion fruit flavor yet allowing a nice sweet oat flavor to cover the flank.  the mouthfeel is full soft and supple. it should be a felony to make an 8% abv beer this drinkable but it’s not surprising coming from the hazy masters.
3766,Pranqster,4.61,pours clear and light golden with very nice head and light lacing. absolutely awesome flowery and citrus like aromas which are very strong. sweet and light sour notes but overall extremely pleasant. almost like rose water and possibly honey; its a very unique taste in beer. medium thinkness in the mouth and very easy drinking.  overall a really wonderful beer!
3767,Pranqster,4.71,what a great surprise this beer turned out to be. i love belgian triples and wanted something lower on the abv scale that had an easy drinkability quality to it. this one is great. this is right up there with brugge zot for an easy going beer in the summer.
3768,Pranqster,5,i have tried this beer out of a bottle at the same one on the picture before the really light had a nice sweet citrusy aroma and the flavor was kind of like a belgian triple also sweet with a citrusy flavor finish
3769,Pranqster,4.17,very solid blue has the usual belgian / farmhouse funk but is also very drinkable and smooth at the same time this is a great beer to get into belgian beers.
3770,Pranqster,4.14,appearance: cloudy deep gold body average size white head modest lacing. aroma: soft orchard fruit. earthy yeastiness slightly sweet maltiness. taste: floral spicy fruity hop footprint. malts and yeast add depth and intensity. mouthfeel: medium-to-full bodied with good carbonation. overall: totally enjoyable.
3771,Pranqster,4.1,poured from a twelve ounce bottle a fast fading initial head and modest lacing. the body pours a cloudy blond color.  taste and nose are super fruity with a delightful honey flavor and some banana. yeast and bread notes are secondary but present. on the sweet side but not cloying. no sign of abv.  good mouthfeel and carbonation this beer is smooth drinking. not as dry complex or strong as duvel but an enjoyable beer.
3772,Pranqster,4.51,excellent blonde. a little too thin on finish.
3773,Pranqster,3.77,for craft domestic it’s fantastic. has belgian overtones no question but is very slightly thin vs a real belgian strong ale. at this price will put some thought into next purchase of 4 pack
3774,Pranqster,3.99,pours a cloudy golden color with a small head and light lacing.  smells of bread yeast and bananas.  tastes of bread yeast cloves and apples with a wheat tanginess.  medium light body with light carbonation. light clean mouthfeel.  this is a very drinkable american brew that is true to the belgian style
3775,Pranqster,4.13,pours a pale golden color with a half a finger pillowy head.  smells very bready hoppy and very wheaty.  goes down smooth yeast and wheat dominate the flavor. medium carbonated leaves minimal lacing. reminds me of a good festbier.
3776,Pranqster,3.61,appearance: pours a cloudy golden color with an off-white foam head that lacks retention.  aroma: belgian esters. apple cider dark fruits honey and biscuit.  taste: sweet honey and candy up front then fades into dark fruit. notable bready yeasty undertones throughout.  overall: not my favorite beer style but is a good experience when looking to explore. this one has a little complexity to it.
3777,Beatification,4.17,sent my way as return fire by @beersnake1 during nbs bif#16.  pours a pure golden yellow thats mostly clear but i wouldnt describe as crisp. the colour actually isnt far off from a slightly lighter version of the label. wet bubbles rise through the liquid but theres no head and thus nothing to retain nor leave lacing.  nose is bright and inviting. starts off much more on the fruity side rather than the truly funky side (were getting there though dont worry!) with some apple and like meyer lemon. the apple transitions to a mustiness that gives rise to thoughts of wood and carries us over to the earthier funkier side with light elements of barnyard and just a kind of tart element.  flavour is awash with an interesting lead in that i want to give credit again to that meyer lemon-type flavour then bits of crabapple and wood giving way to the earthy funk again which presents in a really interesting way that i can only think to describe as open. i dont know how that works but where a lot of funky wild ales like this feel tight compressed bound up tartness this feels like the pages spread wide and a more easygoing (but no less pronounced) welcoming earthy funk. the lemon and the funk kind of build together to a pinnacle about 2/3 of the way through that is more in the horse blanket realm and borders on harsh though the rest of it feels aggressively tart but in a welcoming manner. the back end takes elements from all of the above along with a little bit of bleu cheese and faint honey to leave a tart dry finish.  very fine carbonation sits atop a decidedly funky/tart beer but one that i wouldnt describe as sharp.  ive had several in the -ation series and theyve all been top notch. this is no exception. thanks tim for sending this along my direction!!
3778,Beatification,4.68,bottled 4/3/20. poured at 52°. deep gold with excellent clarity; thin tight white head poor cap retention leaves a small island of micro dots; brief thin ring no lace. mild funk apples and oak nose. tart green apple pear; mild funky horse blanket; white grapes middle; oak; mild tart fruit on backend. light body; moderate minus carbonation; crisp dry finish. overall the funk is mild; drinks like a lambic style minus the barnyard intensity; very approachable…a perfect gate-way beer for those not familiar with belgian lambics who want to dive in.
3779,Beatification,4.79,had this on draft at a place with one of the early rrbc accounts in my area. it brought me back to my first pilgrimage to rrbc in santa rosa at the 4th street location. i thought i was there for the ipas but a family member ran into someone they knew with a goblet of another rrbc barrel-aged product who said i don\t even like beer but i love this! i ordered my own goblets and was introduced to the loveliness of sanctification and consecration.  so began my love affair with rrbc barrel-aged stuff. the 100th percentile score is well-earned. this is a delicious sour which offers common ground to people who normally will not drink sours. the more sophisticated reviews for this will fill in all the notes of stonefruit and granny smith apple stuff that my review lacks; all i have to say is in the same way that you could serve pte to someone who would never touch a dipa with a ten-foot pole a goblet of this can evangelize regular folks with unsophisticated palates like mine to appreciate the wonder of wild ales and sours made by skilled people.
3780,Beatification,4.57,soapy white head that leaves a bit of lacing in a mostly ser throw straw yellow body. funky gristy tart whiskey and oak nose. taste is grains and sour earthen grassy granny smith apple funky sweet vinous. medium mouthfeel and champagne bubble effervescent. wow
3781,Beatification,4.4,bright citrus delightfully tart …special and perfect . doesn’t fatigue palate earthy yeast is welcome
3782,Beatification,4.21,poured from 375ml bottle into my beeradvocate teku. bottled 1/25/22 so its got a solid year under its belt.  appearance: lovely light-golden hue with a little tiny bit of haze and a finger of frothy white foam atop. looks nice.  smell: soft malt with a light sourness and just enough sweetness to give a light candylike aroma. enticing indeed.  taste: tarter than the aroma would suggest but with just enough sweetness to be balanced. the sour isnt super sharp it has some softening around the edges. this is quite an enjoyable beer.  mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a decent carbonation and a nice creaminess. it has both more body and less carbonation than i usually expect from a bottle-conditioned beer.  overall: this is certainly a very nice sour and im quite enjoying it. im glad to have finally tried it and while my experience perhaps does not match the raves this beer receives on this site i am in no way disappointed.
3783,Beatification,4.16,look is golden/yellow. smell is really funky. taste same as the nose funk on the tongue. overall one of the tastier russian river wild ales ive sampled.
3784,Beatification,4.04,look - basically a clear copper color with a nice bubbly white head smell and taste - slight tart oakly with a slight grape winey taste. very earthy feel - meidum light carb with a lighter body. dry overall - i expected more and probably wont try it again.
3785,Beatification,4.13,(5 oz draft pour served in a small wine glass at monks for pty day on 20 feb)  l: poured with only a scant head which collapsed to a thin collar in seconds; no lacing... pale sunny amber-colored liquid with a delicate haze  s: served cold the aromas were muted... barrel funk citrus peel hint of green grass  t: bitter grapefruit and/or orange-forward... tartness mellow at first increasing little by little with each sip... as it warms a floral fruity hop character seems to emerge... ipa is does not taste like but i could imagine the base beer  f: clean light-bodied with a touch of oily viscosity along the jowls during the finish... crisp and lightly effervescent  o: finally finally tried this but im still longing for a full bottle to take my time with and more closely examine (2097)
3786,Beatification,4.08,though in all honesty simply not my kind of style.
3787,Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.9,#169 yum!
3788,Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.5,2022 vintage drank on tap and from the bottle. strong barrel presence with good flavours in the taste; chocolate and vanilla stood out the most with strawberry gently in the background.
3789,Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.77,2022 version sampled from a snifter on tap at ansaris in eagan mn. very thick. great blend of adjuncts with the strawberry up front in a good way.
3790,Dark Island Reserve,4.56,2016 limited edition bottle. sampled december 25 2020.  handsome dark brown pour with a quick fading tan head.  the aroma is roasted dark malts black licorice and alcohol.  full mouthfeel.  the taste is sweet and malt forward with those whiskey barrel characters in play. warming satisfying finish.
3791,Dark Island Reserve,4.89,just an absolutely fabulous world-class beer. i now have 5 bottles and im celebrating for special occasions.
3792,Dark Island Reserve,3.76,consumed on 02/14/2016.
3793,Dark Island Reserve,3.99,thick oily and almost black. wispy dark brown head. complex bouquet. rich roasted malt. smoky. taste follows the nose. burnt bitterness is rather off-putting. hint of vanilla. viscous. a very slow sipper.
3794,Gratitude,4.32,a: a bole toned decant with a burnt umber aid through the emissions while the carafe transpires a canvas brown invention. the process is repeated upon the timed stagnations where the transfers offer/develop a nuanced clarity. at the outset a complementary collar that briefly supersedes the inch by suggesting a unison amongst polypeptides & acids. this comes with a bisque to champagne tinge as the progression works to sever that stature thru a golden fog rim. accordingly a severance that offers an elegant latticework from the refined residues without obligatory tension. in time a viscosity element over the painted – monastery – windows as the increments capitulate a heating engraving  s: a malt to yeast webwork that’s pitted against a new level of aged refermentation as the hop effect distantly grows. the entryway hints at the components most found in a stroopwafel aside the rich caramel conveys. moreover an isoamyl octanoate undercoat to the more direct – dark – fruit bearings where figs atop flame raisins before softly ciphering in pflaumenmus. there is a deciduous camphor airstream in circumference which adds a mint to menthol element while a coniferous scots builds upon the bittering strengths. correspondingly an earthy headway amongst the woodsy incursions as hyssop connotations develop beyond the clove & marjoram orifices. the starch-to-sugar conversions have lessened over the timespan which lends a relaxed saccharification to the aforementioned pillars. a movement that addresses the vintage through a smart solvency given the calculated repression on oxygenation. this comes not only with the years but with phased transfers across balmy – hourly – increments. to that extent an ethyl acetate reflection that involves a nuanced perception on sherry for getting amontillado to reach latakia tobacco  t: the timeworn has elevated the initial sensitivity on the diastatic enzyme conversions to a new level which augments the sweetness by progression. as a result the gustation is more relaxed on the greenery counters as the grain bill pushes those bready to doughy reserves. albeit a hop effect that remains central to the course while esters assist in the hourly altitudes. the dispatches are therefore rich in malt outputs by slinging heath bars aside torta de nata. coupled with barhi dates & dried goji berries as the yeast draws on an ethyl hexanoate chord. this being the implied red fruits with an aniseed cast while a colophony sphere mitigates. due to that fact a tactful hop impact to impart pine needles near dry cedar wood while contextualizing floral bouquets. there is a citrus – grapefruit – bitter articulation thru the expansion which accompanies the candied stone fruits as acetates build off the clocked intervals. meanwhile a distant decant subjected to open air besides the added years for degassed complexities over bustrengo. the notes persevere on the heated draws near bärenjäger & smoked lavender while lightly addressing the behaviors most akin to phenylethanols with a caproate partnership. sequentially the vintage escorts the 4th hour @ a >78°f interval to lend madeira by suggesting malmsey which pursues an oxidized nuttiness. a continuation that implores burning grow houses under elderly dunskins beyond the fiery red grounds  m: cut – bygone – ebullitions amidst a refined adhesiveness which amends sweetness against the fermentable complications. a warming surface structure that’s smooth upon equalizing from an age-old viscosity to a calm desiccation. the output is time-honored with an intrinsic richness as ethanol smartly burns over an attenuated cessation while a suppressed bite rearguards the aridity  o: an oxidized comfort with a refermented/conditioned involvedness which kindles a fine silkiness without barrel foreplay. accordingly a non-barrel aged vintage that swaps esters for the more habitual acetates when calming the greeneries. in this case the added time is paired alongside an uncapped & decanted patience as a way to recognize the impact contingent on evaporation and oxidation
3795,Gratitude,4.3,poured from a can at fridge temp. pours a murky orange with a thin layer of head. nose is wonderful - toffee candy all the way. werthers. raisins plums a touch of minty pine maple and a slight citrus peel note.  the taste is awesome. a perfect balance of sweetness and slight bitterness from the hops. wow. toffee pine citrus peel raisins figs candy big malty note bread and alcohol heat. really well done.  the mouthfeel is dry medium bodied and nicely warming. some alcohol bite is there. the aftertaste is primarily citrus peel bitterness. overall a wonderful example of an american barleywine. i cant wait to see how these age for a little while.
3796,Gratitude,4.27,2022 vintage 12 oz can  pours a very dark copper color. clear. thick cream colored head. great head retention. very nice aroma - toasty caramel malt classic c-hops - citrus dank pine. similar flavors in the taste good balance between the malt and firm bitterness. just a touch boozy. sticky mouthfeel medium bodied.
3797,Gratitude,3.73,pours a bright almost glowing light amber. plenty of head that for some reason reminded me of a tan macaron in both color and texture. overall this is an attractive beer.  aroma is sweet caramel and molasses with fig and some light alcohol lurking. its fairly reserved overall in that nothing bursts from the glass. that said it still smells quite good.  on the tongue the alcohol makes a clear and immediate impression as does the bite from the hops. the malts definitely take a back seat. theres a little bit of sweetness but its clearly secondary.  full bodied and silky smooth. theres a little bit of alcohol warming on the way down but its subdued. low to medium carbonation. very long finish.  overall a good saturday sipper!
3798,Gratitude,4.36,not sure how i dont have this rates?! ive had it several times before.  ill rate this 2022 can  the amber hue is beautiful. also noting hefty sediment st the bottom of the glass.  the smell isnt mind blowing. its fairly benign and unassuming.  the flavor profile is very bigfoot-esque but definitely better. its less bitter than bigfoot and has more caramel sweetness. still a pretty bitter and quintessential example of an american barleywine. in fact... i would argue this is probably thee american barleywine measuring stick. bigfoot is just too much of a palate wrecker though it does convey all the aspects to familiarize one with the style. gratitude does it equally as well but with more refinement imo.  the feel is a little sticky up front but dries out quickly on the finish as you exhale an evaporating heavy dose of ethanol.  overall im drinking this one at cellar temperature of about 57ish and im not enjoying it quite as much as i recall previously. could be a beer thats better more chilled could be im off (very likely) or could be accurate at 4.25.  ---  drinking this again on 12-2-22 this time chilled. this is arguarbly the best american barleywine i know and blows bigfoot away with balance and refinement. bumping twste and overall from 4.25 to 4.75 each for being the arguably best ive experienced per style.
3799,Gratitude,4.41,poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. pours like sun tea or apple cider with a one finger off-white foam head. lot of dried dark fruits in the nose. maybe even some burnt sugar / caramel. taste follows with a pleasant fruity wet cardboard barleywine flavor. this is pretty old school american in the sense that it’s not very toffee or caramel forward. more hoppy and fruity. it has a wonderfully full mouthfeel; enough carbonation but it’s still creamy and way too east drinking for 11%. even as it warmed up it still maintained an easy drinking stature with wonderful fruity hoppy undertones. good stuff.
3800,Gratitude,4,pours a deep burgundy-caramel color with a couple fingers of off-white foam. transparency is obscured by a firm haze. aroma is fig raisins molasses toffee and strong earthy toasty and caramely malts underneath. resiny earthy hops extend the nose a bit further adding a light stickiness thats overshadowed by a dirty earthy note. it really leans more into an earthy nose with malts and hops building on this quality. booze is obscured. flavor profile is caramel toffee molasses fig and raisins layered over malts and hops. malts are forward coming by way of earthy caramely and toasty they ride the heels of the former list of flavor notes. hops dont become apparent until the after taste which carries a heavy sticky resiny hop quality in addition to mild dank and pine. it never leans into sweet nor bitterness striking a middle-of-the-road balance. booze never pops through. mouth feel is medium-thick with a still boiled texture. overall driving malts and big sticky hops keep this one lively. its simplistic perhaps a little old school but is otherwise clean. allowed to warm quite a bit between sitting it out before the pour photo and playing some wii resort golf it warmed towards 55f. it become more muddled as it warmed which is contradictive to the style.  served in a 15.5oz spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. 2022 vintage consumed / reviewed in march 2022.
3801,Gratitude,3,thanks to pinz412 for this one from one of the nbs bifs (i think spring 21). unsure of the vintage; bronze label with dark purple wax and a red cap. 22oz bottle poured into 16oz tulip poured a very muddy medium-dark brown color with just a thin cap of tan head that had low retention and almost no lacing.  the aroma had the expected sweet malts of the style some caramel and a slight mustiness.  same on the tongue with the addition of a bit of unpleasant bitterness on the finish. some alcohol heat as well.  the body was the expected full sweet and had a semi-sweet finish that dried out after a few moments.  drinkability was ok but was hurt by a lack of carbonation.  overall i really wanted to like this brew a lot but it was just lacking all across the board. i still think im being generous with my score. maybe its better fresher or older or a different vintage. i dunno. ymmv.
3802,Goudenband,3.71,330ml bottle into a straight glass. 2022 blend.  dark body red wine when held up to the light. small off white head shrinks to a ring specks of lacing. some cherry notes on the nose but aroma seems a little off. sour cherry taste with some woody notes. tart & sour finish. abv felt. would almost certainly improve with age best by march 2032.
3803,Goudenband,4.69,375ml paper wrapped bottle - pours a dark ruby/deep brown with 1 finger foam head that dissipates rapidly. on the nose notes of dark fruit dried fruit and a hint of vinegar. taste-wise there is a high level of complexity with some really intense flavours. the notes present in the eroma are magnified and a hint of spice and caramrl is also evident. beautiful sweetness with a very tiny touch of tart. incredible beer.
3804,Goudenband,4.35,poured from a bottle into a snifter appearance – the beer pours a dark ruby brown red color with a small head of tan foam. the head fades rather fast leaving a touch of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma of the brew is rather strong of dark fruit smells of plum and prune mixed with a touch of caramel apple and some cherry. other aromas of candied sugar and yeast are there as well mixing in with some notes of roasted ready malts and brownies. a hint of cola and spice are there as well creating a nice inviting aroma overall. taste – thes taste starts out with a nice cherry and plum sweetness with some brown bread and candied sugar flavors. there are nice roasty notes that get stronger toward the middle of the taste profile with them later fading a touch toward the end. at the same time the dark fruit are joined by even more flavors with some raisin and apple coming along. all throughout there is also some yeasty flavors and some light notes of sourness being of a tart raspberry and vinegar flavor. a bit of coriander and some oak develop as well and with a tiny touch of char at the end one is left with a dark fruited very lightly soured and nicely balanced taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is light and thinner with a carbonation level that is high. for the style and the mix of flavors the feel is great and it makes for one dangerously easy sipper. overall – a very nice and tasty lightly sour belgium ale. one i will certainly seek out again.
3805,Goudenband,4.23,750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. 2016 edition had 11/17/21.  pours an opaque dark ruby with a two inch foamy head with very good retention and a good amount of foamy lacing. aromas of cherries caramel malt oak some raspberries light apple. smells lightly sour. tastes lightly sour and tart. flavors of cherries malt caramel oak light apple a hint of chocolate. smooth a very good medium body well carbonated.  above average for the style. it’s a little lighter overall than others but also not as cherry focused. lots of caramel and oak among other aromas and flavors. very easy to drink too. really enjoyable.
3806,Goudenband,4.4,having this beer on draft at lizardville in bedford oh. served to me in a tulip glass this beer draws a very dark copper/amber color with a slightly off-white had that’s about an inch thick on first drawn and served. head eventually settles to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass with some very small spots of surface foam. barely any lacing to speak of. aromas of some toasted bready malts notes of vinegar and lactate along with some fruity esters. a very similar flavor profile with a toasted bready malt presence to start off with that has hints of molasses and brown sugar sweetness. this is followed by some guide notes of apple cherry and dates along with a bit of lactate and vinegar that give it the nice sour note that blends so well with the molasses and brown sugar presence. rounded out with a bit of a woody flavor. although all of the different flavors are pretty subtle overall this beer has a pretty complex flavor profile that i’m enjoying quite a bit. has a somewhat crisp also smooth just slightly prickly light to medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. has a nice long finish and all the different flavors linger nicely on my palate for a long time after each sip.  eric
3807,Goudenband,4.42,had this on draft 9/1/22 @ the hopleaf.  mostly see-through brown/orange appearance.  dark cherry lemon & mild vinegar notes in the nose.  medium thin mouthfeel.  dark cherry & lemon flavors up front; artisanal vinegar & honey notes on the finish.  elegant; so easy to drink for a sour beer. a stunner.
3808,Goudenband,4.4,750ml bottle. paper wrapped bottle. caged and corked bottle. label says blended in 2016; cap has imprinted date of 09 2026. ruby brown colored body with reddish backlit highlights. thin light tan head which sticks around. lacing sticks on all non-drinking sides. aroma of red wine with earthy dark fruit. taste is woody but also sweet from the fruit - apple cherry and raspberry. has the caramel also. aftertaste trails off quickly. medium mouth feel and slightly smooth and syrupy. carbonation is not a big deal here. tastes like a cross between a merlot and cherry cola. this aroma and taste expression is not often found. slightly different flavor nuances are discovered with each sip. really a treat. very good paired with blue cheese.
3809,Goudenband,3.31,on tap at brewery ommegang in cooperstown ny.  this one pours a dark-ish murky brown color with a small head and not much lacing.  this smells like damp wood cherry juice green apple pear and red wine vinegar.  this is simultaneously too sweet and too vinegary for me - its kind of a cloying medicinal sweetness for me and when mixed with the old stale vinegar aspects it definitely clashes. theres some nice woodiness and cherry skin but it just doesnt work out for me. i know its a classic beer and maybe im missing out on something here but its just a contradictory set of flavors for me.  this is medium bodied with a lower level of carbonation and a soft finish. its not particularly sour by any means.  i wanted to like this one a lot more but maybe its just not for me.
3810,Goudenband,3.77,hard to tell exactly what it is trying to be although it grows on you. i was hoping for more funk and candi sugar but it wasnt there. probably would like it more after more tries
3811,Goudenband,3.75,330 ml bottle from the norwegian importer (i could swear i had rated this beer before but apparently not). dark reddish brown colour large beige head. the aroma has first a whiff of smoke then notes of red wine red wine vinegar oak and horse stable. pleasant flavour malty fruity and only moderately sour again notes of red wine red wine vinegar and oak hardly any noticeable hops. still easy drinking due to the fruitiness. the alcohol is well hidden. nice one.
3812,Hurricane High Gravity,3.75,relatively smooth and easy to drink at first but quite one-dimensional i didnt really want to finish the can but did it anyways.
3813,Hurricane High Gravity,3.16,if you like strong beer this is good on a hot day. it needs to be served cold .. around 36 degrees. taste is almost lager or pilsner but much stronger. i doubt it has much barley malt in it but still tastes like beer. be careful .. this has enough alcohol to be dangerous. and the price is always right.
3814,Hurricane High Gravity,2.96,on the nose its a bit like malt vinegar and homeless people urine. like if you walk around a city and encounter random piss stench.  taste takes you similar places.  i almost never spew but this stuff is a bit hard to get down.  i can drink whiskey all night but this had me wanting a nap after my first pint.  edit: this was my warm review. picked up a florida six pack on my way to the gym at the dollar store.  will try this chilled a little later on.  ok chilled update:  2 pints down cracking my third..  not bad.
3815,Hurricane High Gravity,3.68,this is my go-to beer because it’s cheap. but it doesn’t taste like cheap beer or water. any brewer (home or otherwise) will tell a casual beer lover that higher gravity means a higher grain bill (malt and usually more yeast to consume that higher sugar content). higher grain bill means more flavor. among ab-inbev’s usual offerings (not including crafts like wicked weed here in asheville) this is the best lager. it beats the hell out of budweiser you don’t have to drink as many to sleep well and it’s cheaper than any other beer at my local stores! good value for the price! yes i like crafts like new belgium’s voodoo ranger imperial ipa (also produced here in asheville) but hurricane is about $8 for 12. craft beers are at least twice as much. it puts me to sleep without a lot of tossing and turning and that’s why i drink beer at night.
3816,Hurricane High Gravity,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included. today at 06:16 pm edit delete
3817,Hurricane High Gravity,3.12,this is the best cheap beer hands down for a few reasons. number one is the taste. when i was a heavy drinker i would buy pitbulls earthquakes and natty daddys. if it was a particularly rough week id have to drink camo. all those drinks have a terrible sour taste to them that makes you cringe after a swig. the only reason you want to get drunk is to hide the same your feeling. hurricane actually tastes fine as long as its really cold. it doesnt have that sour and sickly aftertaste at all (as long as its cold.) number 2 is the strength. 8% is lower than a heavy ipa but its way better than a light beer. it gets you drunk. after a rough week 2 (or 3 if you dont have to wake up early the next day) of these will relax you quite a bit. the drunk is good too unlike some of the super cheap paint thinner cans you can buy. thats really all you need to know. the look and feel of this beer arent important. its the price the abv and the drunkeness. enjoy!
3818,Hurricane High Gravity,2.43,poured from an undated 25oz can into a pils glass.  on the pour i am honestly surprised by a 2 finger fine head. the body has lively carbonation as expected is a dark straw to gold crystal clear and is crystal clear. the head recedes to a decent covering and remains relatively fine some lacing is left.  aroma on the other hand is as expected for a high gravity lager. smells kind of like sweat fermented green apple off notes along with skunk which i guess implies some sort of hopping. an alcoholic note resides at the back along with a vague note of malt. overall it just smells like yeast that was treated like an alcohol producing slave and worked way past its useful limits with low quality hops and a malt bill that\s been watered down with adjuncts likely rice or corn syrup.  flavor is quite similar to the aroma with some harsh out of place esters and a hard to explain tartness behind that a surprising amount of hop bitterness creeps in likely to cover up dirty fermentation notes. alcohol is detectable and the only positive to that is that eventually the burning and inebriation covers more and more off notes making what malt is present on the finish more and more noticeable as you drink which is about the only redeeming factor once you actually start drinking.  feel is at first light any other full flavor aal but the co2 bit is quite high and the finish is quite dry but surprisingly drawn out despite the general thinness on the palate. not the worst but not the best pretty average but it keeps it drinkable.  overall it could be worse but this isnt a very high quality beer. it will get you drunk its cheap and its not the worst thing thats passed my lips.
3819,Hurricane High Gravity,3.63,i find that instead of acquiring a taste for expensive craft beers its better to acquire a taste for cheap high gravity beers. its a lot cheaper and the money you save can be used for cheeseburgers. this beer fits the bill it tastes better than steel reserve. while that isnt saying much its not bad and you get a lot of bang for the buck. im not going to pretend that i only drink for the taste. i like to get a buzz going this one does it very effectively.
3820,Hurricane High Gravity,3,from a 25oz can:  appearance: clear gold big head.  smell: sweet boozy.  taste: sweet fruity—apples & grapes. little bit of corn underneath. boozy. no weird aftertaste.  overall: traveling for work must pick up a beer or three. but the beer selection is not great in this smaller city so lets try a malt liquor. hurricane high gravity is not bad! sure its not my first or fifteenth choice but its got decent flavor and no real ugliness that you can get with many high gravity malt liquors.
3821,Hurricane High Gravity,2.39,you ever felt down on your luck or had a really hard day at work and was thirsty? look no further then your local gas station dive bar or local beer store and pickup a tallboy size or if offered 40oz of hurricane. why did anheuser busch name it hurricane. well.. it depends on the batch brewed but your bound to have a hurricane effect either emotionally physically or psychologically from drinking it. i’ll leave the graphic effects out.  nevertheless it is on par with its other contenders for pour taste smell and overall quality. which is in a class of its own. it’s not terrible by any means. if consumed ice cold and drank fast before it changes internal temperatures fast it is worth every penny. if your looking to get drunk fast and you have a few bucks in your pocket this is the go to malt liquor. if you have a few more bucks do yourself a favor a look to the cabinet where a tall boy or 40oz is about a dollar more. you’ll thank yourself later
3822,Hurricane High Gravity,4.17,honestly a solid product doesnt taste bad as long as its ice cold the price is right when im broke and the reactions i get at parties when drinking these is priceless. usually 1 or 2 people try it and end up changing their mind haha! far from a bum drink if you ask me
3823,Hurricane High Gravity,3.16,light gold body clear; lively carbonation; thick white head dense and foamy. very faint aroma; just touch of graininess. respectable flavor; grainy sweet and bitter with a fairly prominent alcohol presence; phenol suggestion. medium-heavy body; some sticky residual sugar notes; somewhat dry with a strong alcohol effect.  a basic american malt liquor. it hits the abv style squarely has great looks but little distinctive smell and the taste while not bad doesnt lend itself to repeat visits.  poured at 42 °f; canning data on bottom of the can: 21269
3824,Ground State,4.28,appearance - the beer poured a silky black color with tan bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.  smell - the nose was like fresh ground coffee the good kind.  taste - the initial taste was like fresh coffee. it had hints of maple and brown sugar. the sweetness was not overbearing and had a bit of nuttiness. the sweet coffee lingered in the aftertaste.  mouthfeel - though not exceptionally thick the beer had viscosity.  overall - my 2018 bottle was a bit faded but quite nice.
3825,Ground State,4.27,2017 version poured from a bottle into a snifter. really nicely blended with a little heat in the finish.
3826,Ground State,4.88,nice bba stout! notes of coffee maple oak vanilla and bourbon.
3827,Double Citra®,4.59,a textbook citra showcase; aroma is orange marmalade grapefruit zest juicy tangerine and a hint of grass. taste gives juicy tangerine and pulpy & zesty grapefruit slightly grassy and just a hint of malty sweetness on the finish. medium body with moderate carbonation foamy mouthfeel turns into a creamy finish high drinkability
3828,Double Citra®,4.28,slightly malty tropical hoppy and a subtle orange citrus nose on this one! taste follows with some sweet and floral orange citrus malty-sweetness a kiss of briny minerality and a subdued hoppy bitter finish. as this was canned on 4/18/23 (consumed on 6/7/23) i had this while it was a little long in the tooth...but you can tell that this was absolutely fantastic when fresh. this is still well-made and delicious!
3829,Double Citra®,4.9,#165 yum!
3830,Double Citra®,4.53,pour at de garde 10th anniversary. hazy golden pour thin white foamy head. citrusy aroma grapefruit and some piney hops. taste is fruity and citrusy hops getting a bit more dank hop resin. smooth full body. another stellar ipa from hill farmstead.
3831,Double Citra®,4.26,deep orange and semi-transparent. nose is stone fruit and slight resin. taste is very peach and mango forward w/ a little malt for balance. brief lingering bitterness. crisp clean mouthfeel.
3832,Double Citra®,4.47,3 months old. can to wine glass.  l: pours an opaque golden orange with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. plenty of tiny floaters visible.  s: grassy piney and slightly citrusy.  t: very hoppy. subtle notes of citrus as well as tropical fruits paired with piney and grassy notes. medium sweetness medium bitterness.  f: highly drinkable with a medium carbonation. minimally sticky.  o: very complex in a subtle way and overall a very good beer. interestingly its not as citrus-forward as many other single hop citra ipas. instead its rather piney with a touch of west coast in it. great craftsmanship as always from hf
3833,Canuckley,5,07/07/23 bottle @ home (2022 vintage)
3834,Canuckley,4.5,pours deep deep black. aroma is sominated by roastiness coffee & bourbon. taste is incredible. a well balanced combination of maple bourbon & coffee flavors. mouthfeel is full & oily.
3835,Canuckley,4.34,2022 vintage  i picked this one up on a whim on tavour just because i’m a sucker for maple syrup in a stout but little did i know that this is a highly acclaimed take on the style. i’ve heard good things about transient bu haven’t has them until now. let’s pop thid guy open see what it’s all about  pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of dense dark tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  the maple honestly isn’t even the first thing that jumps out at me in the nose opting for a thinner maple profile to support the other adjuncts. i’m picming up on aromas of dark roast coffee sweet bourbon milk chocolate maple sap burnt caramel molasses charred oak and light vanilla  it’s also not extremely maple in taste but it is unfortunately a bit sweeter than the nose led me to believe. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting burnt caramel dark roast coffee black cherry dark chocolate maple syrup vanilla toasted oak and light bourbon. the swallow brings notes of maple syrup milk chocolate medium roast coffee black cherry raisin vanilla toasted oak and sweet bourbon  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick beer. finishes a tad sticky but drinks remarkably below its abv  while it is quite sweet it’s damn good and way too easy to drink for being 14.5%
3836,Canuckley,4.37,full of flavors - vanilla  coffee and maple slightly sweet with big malt taste
3837,Canuckley,2.85,on-draught @ ashleys ann arbor michigan.  bit of a chore to drink. maple syrup renders it saccharine even in 25cl serving sizes. thick. hersheys syrup. chocolatey.  not my favourite. barrel flavour is barely noticeable given the hefty sugary sweetness and syrupy feel.  low c / average
3838,Canuckley,4.53,i can’t find the year this was bottled but it’s a 22oz bottle version so at least a few years old.  consumed 4/21/23  the coffee has started to go green peppery now but it’s not awful. my friend thought the beer had some chili pepper in it when trying it and not knowing what beer i gave him. i love the barrel notes and maple balance. still a great beer but better fresh
3839,Canuckley,4.49,brewers notes: imperial stout with vanilla maple syrup and coffee. aged in blis maple syrup bourbon barrels for 12 months.  bottle received in bif17 from @ovaltine erases a want off of my “wants” list 2022 edition  poured into a snifter  appearance =motor oil black liquid fizzy big bubbled brown foam cap that quickly fades  smell= aroma is bourbon coffee roast malts slight char  taste = sweet bourbon maple coffee  mouthfeel = thick syrupy boozy without the heat abv well hidden sweet not heat  good beer
3840,Berliner Apfel,4.73,a delightful light and crisp very effervescent beer in the glass. lots of bubbles but with a neat head. first sip is a delicious melange of green apple and pears nearly a cider in terms of flavor. needless to say berliner apfel would pair well with many sandwiches or dinners but perhaps it is most well suited to pork. the light clean taste would cut through and complement some of the fatty full flavor of pork. i’ll tell you something else at 4.2 abv i think this would make a decent session beer. it’s a clean enough taste that i can see have four or five of these without it becoming cloying. it’s not overly sweet like some beers and ciders. tailor made for bratwursts imho. ;)
3841,Berliner Apfel,4.28,12oz bottle poured into a goblet a: hazy pale orange one finger head s: cereal/green apple t: almost cider-like fresh tart & sweet green apple with wheat and pear in the background m: light crisp/effervescent slightly sweet & tart o: crisp tasty and refreshing
3842,Berliner Apfel,4.42,poured from a 12oz bottle into my tall new glarus pilsner glass. pours a slightly hazy yellowish gold with over three fingers of soapy white foam head. sweet green apple and green apple candy on the nose. lightly tart but juicy sweet green apples in the taste. so light and refreshing. medium-full mouthfeel. nicely carbonated - that is not too much here but enough. perfect late summer beverage. new glarus’s fruit game is off the charts.
3843,Berliner Apfel,4.52,(12 oz bottle no date/code; purchased single off shelf at their beer depot this week... poured into a shaker pint)  mildly-cloudy yellow straw colored liquid; ultra-tight cottony foam that builds high and lasts long... on the nose: apple cider mushed up fresh apple; nothing suggesting great sweetness; amazing expression... palate: amazing; again this is decidedly apple-forward; no overt berliner weisse character even the malt/wheat character is more full and (sourdough-)bready compared to a true berliner; the aftertaste is apple flesh/skin lemon juice boudin boule... textures: pillowy in body with a tart snap in the finish; inflated flow lifting palate airy  having now had 5 different fruited beers from new glarus this week i cant help but to declare them possibly the best fruit beer brewery in the states... i couldnt put this beer down moreish to a t... no this isnt a true berliner weisse but this is utterly phenomenal work (2188)
3844,Berliner Apfel,4.01,bringing cider over to the beer side of the drinking fence new glarus takes their premiere fruit series of beer to the tart side with the help of copious amounts of green apple and spontaneous fermentation.  starting with a shallow golden straw color and basically clear berliner apfel starts with a foamy head that shows a zesty and sparkling pep that dissipates rather quickly. as a sparkling cider appearances takes hold a sour ale-like maltiness shows up first in aroma with a slow rise of sourdough taffy and yes... apple. flavors follow suit with a skim malt balance scant sweetness and dough.  as the ale washes the middle palate its apple taste blends well with the suggestive juiciness of pear lemon lime gooseberry and passionfruit. for a simple and less complicated taste the ale layers its flavors very well without ever loosing its tart balance. winey spritzy and decidedly cidery this apple heavy beer takes on a acidic taste and texture but not without a persistent balance of sourdough even late in taste.  crisp clean and simple in its flavor profile the uncomplicated session is an elevated cider with beery roots perfect for a refreshing session of apple fans with a brief echo of sourdough and lactic acid.
3845,Berliner Apfel,3.92,murky yellow body finger of pearl white foam sparse sporadic lacing. smells like apple cider meets gentle cereal and wheat not very sharp for style. taste of apple cider gummy with gentle lemon forward berliner trappings backing easy drinking and tasty but depth is limited. feel is very mildly tart more light beer body than a berliner fizzy even. still i am enjoying my 4 pack on the porch this summer and early fall. not every beer needs to be a deep and serious endeavor. points for the flavors pulling through the whole glass nicely
3846,Berliner Apfel,3.63,it is a sparkling tart apple drink. no funkiness from the spontaneous fermentation just tartness. rather simple and one dimensional compared to the great berliners. still enjoyable and quite easy to drink.
3847,Berliner Apfel,4.24,12oz bottle. etched at bottom of bottle is 023012002173b. cloudy straw colored body. one finger of white head quickly disappears to some islands and a ring. leaves behind partial rings of lacing. aroma of apple and pear with a lurking of bready malt. taste is sweet with apple and pear. minor tartness mostly sweet. sweet apple in the aftertaste. medium mouth feel with some stickiness which coats the mouth. very minor tongue sting but indication of alcohol. refreshingly sweet and very easy to drink.
3848,Berliner Apfel,3.86,bottle at share courtesy of steve. pale champagne colored body with a small frothy head. tart apples in both the aroma and the taste. seet prminent apple flavors tart.
3849,Péché Mortel,4.27,understated smooth a bit of chocolate and char roast malts coffee very well rounded and tastes great without a bunch of adjuncts.
3850,Péché Mortel,3.49,11.5oz bottle purchased at community pint in spokane wa. according to the stamp on the rear level this was bottled on february 23 2022. different label than what is shown here.  poured into a snifter this was the color of darkest night with a thin tan head that did not stick around for very long.  nose was initially of coffee and molasses. as it warmed there was an aroma similar to cinnamon that stepped up to the plate.  very understated. vaguely coffeeish and cinnamon flavor but the coffee was really quite muted. apart from that just a vaguely roasty malt flavor was present. bitter coffee flavor at the swallow.  fairly light bodied for an imperial stout. kinda watery really.  im not a fan. maybe this is too old maybe it was abused by whatever distributor brought it to community pint (im familiar enough with them to know they store beer well) but i also recall the two other beers ive had from dieu du ciel also turned out similarly when i got a chance to try them. maybe im just not on their wavelength or theyre not on mine. i think im done trying their beers short of actually going to montreal and trying them at the source. disappointing.
3851,Péché Mortel,4.21,finally got to try this top ranked beer in canada. does it live up to it’s rep. lets find out.the pour is indeed thick and black with a coffee collar that stayed for a bit. nose is coffee roasted goodness with chocolate underlay. taste is similar with roasted coffee upfront and boozy finish. feel is light surprisingly not as much body as i was expecting. look it’s good but do think some brewers in canada have come up with comparables. rorshach comes to mind as does flying monkeys attempts and third moon. this one has been around for ages and so its reputation has built but i do feel ontario can now match it’s prowess.
3852,Péché Mortel,4.33,one year old. can to snifter.  l: pours pitch black with a light brown head that leaves a bit of lacing. a couple of very fine floaters visible.  s: coffee cocoa dark chocolate and vanilla. dark and smoky with some sweet hints.  t: dark and malty with notes of coffee and dark chocolate complemented by some smoky hints. minimal sweetness. very bitter.  f: smooth and creamy on the one side. rather light bodied and drinkable on the other side. medium carbonation.  o: very good no-bullshit coffee stout with a classic flavor profile. drinks very smoothly but could be a bit thicker. works great even without any barrel aging.
3853,Péché Mortel,4.35,pours a dark brown/black with a 1f tan head and moderate lacing.  smells of coffee chocolate and caramel.  tastes of toasted malt dark chocolate mildly bitter coffee  caramel and vanilla with a mildly bitter boozy warm finish.  medium heavy body with light carbonation. lush syrupy mouthfeel.  this is a well made very strong and complex sipper. its at its most bitter just out of the refrigerator and gets sweeter and mellower as it warms.
3854,Péché Mortel,4.34,bottled on 2016-01-11 12:14lot114
3855,Péché Mortel,3.98,11.5oz can received as a gift from a friend. batch number 69. i emailed the brewery to ask when this was bottled. they said approximately 2013-10-17 so this beer is almost 9 1/2 years old! interesting and surprising fact - this is a screw-off bottle cap!  look: this beer is quite dark (black with brown highlights) but doesnt appear to be so thick. there is a very thin tan-colored head around the rim of the glass.  smell: nice roasted malt coffee and chocolate aromas. a bit of fruitiness and lots of booze. slightly reminiscent of chocolate covered cherry cordials.  taste: its tasty. for me this has the right amount of sweetness and bitterness. up front its very roasty and a bit fruity somewhat sweet. the finish is initially mildly sweet and then gradually shifts to a full-on bitter chocolatey and coffee-laden finish.  feel: its on the thin side for an imperial stout i would call this medium bodied or perhaps medium plus. appropriately carbonated - not too much carbonation and not too little either. as i take my time to sip on this its not nearly as enjoyable as it loses its carbonation.  overall: its a very solid coffee imperial stout. i had this beer once before either at a bottle share or at home over 15 years ago. i remember being extremely impressed with it then. im not so taken with this beer now. im not sure if its because this bottle has a lot of age on it or because the bar has been raised for coffee stouts and craft beer in general over time. i think that this is not getting a fair shake due to age. either way this aged bottle is good (not amazing in my opinion). then again my review needs to be taken in consideration given that this bottle is old and that a fresh bottle will undoubtedly taste different and probably a lot better.
3856,Péché Mortel,4.44,11.5oz bottle bottled date: 2021-08-12 consumed on: 17 feb 2023 glass: snifter abv: 9.5 % serving temp: room temp   look: thick black with a 1-finger creamy light brown head. the head is slow to dissipate and leaves awesome lacing along the glass.  smell: lightly sweetened medium to light roast coffee. bittersweet chocolate. notes of vanilla and a touch of oak. the vanilla makes the brew smell like it has some cream or more accurately creamer (good creamer) in it. a faint wisp of smoke can be detected if one tries.  taste: wonderfully balanced sweetened medium-roast coffee with a touch of cream and bittersweet chocolate. a nice earthy bitterness is present but is part of the coffee and does not overwhelm. the sip finishes spicy a bit bitter but also a touch sweet. smokiness shows up in the aftertaste.  feel: smooth and viscous. some late warmth from the alcohol. the body is medium with a step to the thin side.  overall: an excellent imperial coffee stout. nicely complex very tasty and surprisingly drinkable. the only knock to the brew is its thinner-than-expected body. but thats my issue not the beers.  if you like coffee and/or coffee stouts pick this up and give it a try.
3857,Péché Mortel,5,to be fair i’ve been drinking peche mortel for about 12 years. over the years i’ve had some great beers but this is the only one i’m willing to buy online to make sure i have it readily in stock. it pours nearly black with a half finger of creamy hazelnut-colored head. the smell let’s you know what kind of a ride you are about to enjoy. a punch of roasted coffee comes first followed by dark chocolate dark fruits leather and tobacco smoke. the taste follows the nose with each aspect getting to shine as the beer warms. coffee roast dark chocolate are front and center with some subtle dark fruitiness giving way to a leather and ash finish. all are well balanced. the mouthfeel is creamy with a moderate carbonation but isnt overly boozy for 9.5% abv. to this day the best beer i’ve ever had.
3858,Péché Mortel,4.2,11.5oz bottle into a pint glass. bottled 3/2015 so 7 years old.  black body small tan head doesnt last long but leaves a light spiders web of lacing.  aroma is nicely of coffee.  on tasting strong coffee flavor smooth lightly sweet some warmth from the abv.  mouth above medium finish coffee with a faint roasted malt.  overall impressed that 7 years in the bottle doesnt diminish the coffee. unless a fresh one is an outright coffee bomb.
3859,Péché Mortel,3.99,2015 vintage; growler into pint glass. pours essentially black with no head. initial impression is roasted malts dark choclate and coffee grounds. mouthfeel is medium - thinner than i like for a stout. finish fades to a smokycoffee bitterness. overall an interesting and true-to-style imperial stout.
3860,Péché Mortel,4.5,solid black appearance with a thin tan head. has light carbonation thick heavy feel to the body. aroma is a deep rich smokeychar dark bakers chocolate coffee grinds. taste has a harsh but pleasant coffee bitterness dry dark chocolate roasted malt with some smokey wood. overall an excellent beer
3861,Péché Mortel,3.5,light stout slightly creamy but nothing else
3862,Péché Mortel,3.75,poured nicely. very noticeable coffee smell. too much. doesnt taste like beer with coffee tastes like coffee with carbonation. overpowering. not to my liking.
3863,Péché Mortel,4.44,a magnificent stout with a bold in-your-face roasted coffee flavor. poured from a twelve ounce bottle dated 2019.  body poured bible black with initial head that receded to a thin ring around the edge during the tasting.  the nose is roasted coffee with chocolate flavor expressed from the malts. very pleasing.  the body follows the nose but adds a significant bitterness. chocolate malts and char arrive with the bitterness than all fade to a dry finish.  mouthfeel is good though a bit thin for my expectations of a stout of high abv. the powerful flavor more than compensates.  coffee fans must track this beer down. youll thank me later.
3864,Péché Mortel,4.19,pours black. aroma is best feature of this beer. incredibly intense coffee aroma with equally intense dark chocolate & roasty smokey char. taste doesnt match aroma. tastes like im drinking strong coffee. thats it. mouthfeel is way too thin for me.
3865,Péché Mortel,4.44,drinking this fucker walking through modern day mcarthur park..if you know you know . its like the 90s all over again here  dieu de ciel - peche mortel imperial stout with coffee. no bottle date not a fan of their label rework at all but its whats inside that counts right  drinking it out the bottle so forgive my notes. nose is alll roasted coffee goodness cacao nibs semi sweet chocolate and dark malts. a bit on the sweeter side . as with all well made stouts taste follows nose with that big robust coffee flavor  semivsweet chocolate cacao dark fruit and big dark malt flavor that adds some sweetness (coffee balances this well cuz its not overpowering sweetness at all very mild) .  look: dont know.  feel: as expected from non ba coffee stout. lingers on the palate for a while and gives your teeth that drinking coffee dry feel.  overall : enjoyable no bullshit coffee stout. thanks @micada
3866,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included. today at 06:16 pm edit delete
3867,Hurricane Malt Liquor,1.85,purchased as a single tall can from exxon for $2.99. poured into a nonic pint glass.  l - clear goldenrod with a minimal pale white head. s - slight ethanol on the nose. corn flakes. refined wheat. t - same as the aroma but with a little bit of a metallic note (ill blame it on the can). a little bit like dryer lint as well. f - light-bodied with plenty of carbonation. really easy-to-drink if you ignore the taste. o - its pretty bad but one of the better macro malt liquors out there. not as good as oe800 but better than mickeys. ive had this before but this is the only time ive gotten to actually give it a review. if youre pre-gaming before a big trip to a goodwill to look for parts to build a space shuttle this is the brew for you!
3868,Hurricane Malt Liquor,1.17,drain-pour!
3869,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.12,l: a very nice clear hold with a hint of amber and a full white head that quickly dissolves into a thin ring and islands s: corn malts no hops or off aromas t: okay. a mild corn sweetness with some apple or pear a bit of buttered biscuit and the slightest hint of hops. f: mildly carbonated slightly sweet at the front of the swallow fairly smooth going down and leaving a very slight pepper on your tongue and a slightly bitter sweet aftertaste o: this is the driest and lightest tasting on the malt liquors ive tried. you can tell it shares the ab bloodline in a blind test hurricane could easily be mistaken for one of the budweiser or busch beers. if you like bud youll probably like hurricane.
3870,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2.38,the head fizzled away fairly quickly but there are still a large amount of bubbles forming an rising to the top to quickly have their gas escape into the world.  the nose is a mix of malt and weak brown sugar sweetness and metallic medicinal notes that are filling in for hop bitterness in an unsuccessful attempt. its actually somewhat off-putting.  luckily the taste avoids the aromas pitfall. its actually not that bad. it has a little bit of toast mixed in with the sweetness that it brings. and its not overly sweet by any means. theres a generic bitterness that i might argue is slightly woody (maybe it had some contact with some beechwood chips). theres a slight unripe banana note in the aftertaste.  the nose hurts this a lot and warmth isnt its friend. but there were some parts that werent so bad. drinking fairly cold was better.
3871,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2,another downer i had its high gravity counterpart and while it was below average it was much closer to average than poor. this one is right at the 2 level that separates poor from terrible. pours mostly clear yellow. aroma is sweet and grainy but something is off. taste is sweet in an unpleasant way not overly sweet just not a good sweet.
3872,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2.19,this is by no means a great beer but it is my preferred (lol) malt liquor! 25 oz can ice cold goes down smooth and easy. 2 cans for $3 at the local weis... sold! seriously its malt liquor- but in my opinion one of the better ones offered. cheers!
3873,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.51,(40 oz clear bottle category 5 6% alc./vol. 18292 code... purchased cold decanted into tulip)  l: crystal-clear brassy-colored liquid topped with loose bouncy off-white suds which collapse in 2 min... actually several boogers of lace gets chunkier with longer rings with each pour also keeps a collar  s: dried grass dried flowers musty burlap/cardboard soft hint of skunk; underlying hang of cereal-like graininess (kix-forward) faint metallic overtone dull presence of alcohol  t: dominant note front and center of a mildly-sweet hard candy with a dull citrus and/or butterscotch flavor - havent tasted quite this shade of malt syrup-osity in any other malt liquor... kind of a champagne soda aftertaste with a very delicate spicy phenol lingering as well as a faint nutty husk note  f: with first pour very little carbonation to excite the palate; even with subsequent pours kicking up a tall head it doesnt translate to anything remotely prickly on the tongue... the body starts with a mild oily grip but immediately thins out leaving no impression of dimension... rather delicate warmth stirs after each sip  o: skunk not as bad as others... goes down pretty easy and it grew on me but id recommend drinking it colder to avoid the odd hard candy element - its not that bizarre of a flavor for something like this seemed to trail off but lacks a secondary flavor to balance it... at any rate surprised at its relative quality - didnt intend to but drank almost the whole bottle
3874,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.47,decent malt liquor. picked up a six of pint cans while out of town. aroma is sweet fruit and corn. flavor tracks with green apple and grape making an appearance with a grassy finish. cheap easy drinking.
3875,Hurricane Malt Liquor,4.37,my daily driver! preferred beer in my book. i drink about 3 25oz cans a day. dont know why i prefer over other beers. i dont get drunk on this beer. i dont know why my tollarence is so high.
3876,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.73,perfect if you want to get hammered (make sure to get the 40oz) love the taste but it varies on bottle to bottle. sometimes i’ll get one and it smells and tastes like cough syrup probably due to too much bleach during the sterilization process. other than that in idaho the abv is 8.1% but i’ve seen others like ny la nc and ca that are locked in at 5.9% - 6%. great malt though. definitely recommend you to try it if you’re wanting to get drunk.
3877,Hurricane Malt Liquor,4.7,appearance- nice golden with a very thick white head. aroma -sweet malty corny ricey lots of white breadiness low hoppiness..not much. taste- very sweet malty corny ricey white breadiness and decent hop bite. mouthfeel-light-medium with a light-medium body. overall- its a great malt liquor to try from ab-inbev. a nice well rounded beer flavored malt liquor with a slight fruity note. better than king cobra in my opinion. would recommend.
3878,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.05,(as hurricane with category 5 on the label but the abv listed at the top of the label as being 6% abv - not 8.1% or 5.8% or 5.9% abv as i\ve seen on other hurricane branded beers).  malt liquor. 6% abv. 138 kcal per 12oz / 577.39 kj per 12 oz. 0.00 fat per 12 oz. 4.20 carbohydrates per 12 oz. .90 protein per 12 oz.  ingredients: water; corn rice and/or dextrose syrup; barley malt; hop extract; yeast.  glass bottle in the classic 40oz format purchased at a 7-11 in manhattan for $3.31 including tax and deposit. clear glass. branded black screw-off cap.  pours a clear pale copper body - obviously filtered - below an off-white cap of mediocre consistency and above average retention (~5-7 minutes).  aroma hints at graininess in addition to decently disguised corn adjunct cheap 6-row barley and pale malt. inoffensive. doesnt suggest a syrupy or watery beer but im reading it as on the thicker side based on this aroma. hop profile isnt completely absent; i think i get some mild grassiness. suggests an innocuous malt liquor with no egregious flaws but plenty of shortcomings in terms of complexity depth of flavour subtlety balance and build. aromatic intensity is below average. doesnt seem boozy and i detect no off-notes.  taste is indeed innocuous and inoffensive which is high praise for a malt liquor. sure theres a bit too much 6 row and pale malt sweetness as well as corn adjunct and its a bit too thick but it isnt syrupy or watery and it isnt cloyingly sweet or overly adjunct-emphatic. ive certainly had worse and theres a slight scintilla of grassy hop flavour to its credit.  certainly not dialed-in but its not imbalanced. shallow and simple but approachable and pleasant enough for a 6% abv malt liquor offered in the 40 oz format. lets be fair - theres far worse out there. this may be a bit insipid but that isnt always a bad thing in the budget beer category.  texture is slightly overcarbonated and crisp. unrefreshing owing to its slightly syrupy feel and overly thick presence on the palate. has too much weight on the palate for a beer as insipid as this. not oily gushed tannic astringent rough hot boozy or scratchy. this mouthfeel doesnt elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific flavours but it also doesnt clash with the taste.  overall its mediocre at best but its one of the better (least bad?) attempts at the style ive tried recently. $2.99 usd plus tax and deposit is as fair a price as youll find in manhattan for such an inoffensive brew and this is probably up there with ballantine xxx in terms of my go-to budget 40oz format brews. many will shit on this because it happens to be brewed by anheuser-busch but in a blind taste test im confident itd outperform most competing brands. judging it strictly to style its actually pretty decent fare and i wont mind taking down the entire 40oz bottle.  low c+ (3.05) / above average
3879,Morning Wood,4.47,2017 vintage  beer 1400!!! i purposely saved this one for this landmark review since i reviewed the base version and the imperial version a few weeks back. this has been a long time want of mine and luckily i was able to get the whole series at once. this bourbon barrel-aged variant has been sitting at the highest rated imperial porter for a long time on ba and #38 overall. let’s see if it lives up to the hype  pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the bourbon is definitely present in the nose making the whole thing quite a bit sweeter but still really good. i’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon charred oak salty bacon medium roast coffee milk chocolate maple syrup burnt caramel and light brown sugar  it’s an absolute smack in the face of every single element in taste wow. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting smoky bacon milk chocolate maple candy sweetened coffee sweet bourbon raisin toasted oak creamy vanilla and caramel. the swallow brings notes of salty bacon charred oak dark chocolate medium roast coffee burnt caramel brown sugar maple syrup smoked malt and vanilla  a medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a smooth and silky beer. finishes mostly dry with a warming alcohol presence  man it’s been so much fun trying my way through this series. this one is the clear winner. i hope i get a chance to try them all fresh one day
3880,Morning Wood,4.59,22oz bomber bottle. most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11% on the bottle but was told this was a 2018 vintage of morning wood.  poured into durobar charente glass.  appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. light lacing. good staying power. thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down.  smell: big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. hints of chocolate oak and bourbon.  taste: immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. hint of dads brand root beer candies and cola. finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. this is complex superbly balanced and flat out really really tasty. easily exceeds my expectations for sure.  mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. very smooth and not any booze at all.  overall: finally! pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to taturbo. this beer is rich without being overly sweet. the barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. the balance is also quite impressive as well. put this beer on your must try list if you havent. breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. whats not to like? the barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. nice work here from funky buddha for sure.
3881,Morning Wood,4.53,damn the minute i opened this i was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... in terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. a lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. it is pretty viscous. back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon oak bourbon and chocolate. all of those aromas are quite strong - so i am not really getting much in the way of coffee.  taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as i remember from having this in the past. there is much more roasted malt chocolate smoked malts with some slight meaty notes and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. feel is thick full bodied and luscious. moderate carbonation. sort of drier on the finish.
3882,Old Rasputin,4.67,looks - the old rasputin has an awesome thick head and the color is midnight black. aromas - getting nutty and chocolate notes. this one feels very thick in the mouth and im getting strong malt chocolate and woody like notes.  overall just an awesome beer!
3883,Old Rasputin,4.49,one of my favorites; the co-op down the street sells it a bottle at a time.
3884,Old Rasputin,3.92,one of the first i tried when i got into beer years back and still one i often fall back on when theres nothing new im interested in. beautiful black. lacing that wont quit. alcohol definitely comes thru a little strong on the nose but not too bad on the taste. feel could be better. little fizzy... i dont know how else to describe it.
3885,Old Rasputin,4.36,on tap at my (formerly) favorite watering hole. even worse was it was on special making it deliciously delicious.  all i can say is wow. i normally cant session stouts but this one went down smooth. a few of them and i was on cloud 9. the abv sneaks up on you so be careful.
3886,Old Rasputin,4.79,nothing i don’t like about this beer! great sipping beer! just buy it!
3887,Old Rasputin,4.47,color is black with a mocha head smell is roast malty and a little sweet taste has caramel and malt upfront with a bitter coco finish the feel is a little oily and clingy at first but then smooth this is an outstanding example of an imperial stout which makes it dangerously drinkable.
3888,Old Rasputin,4.48,black in color light creamy brown head dense with some staying power; some lace.  nose is rich in roasted aromas dark chocolate that carries some fudge aspects espresso strong hop presence as well; adds to the perception of incoming bitter flavors.  taste mostly mirrors the nose this beer is dark chocolate and espresso but it carries a chocolate richness to it as well; the finish is very hoppy pine and rind like in nature.  high end of medium for body; it has a luscious creamy feel to it super smooth on the palette and a big kick of bitter american hops on the finish...the roast also adds a substantial bitterness as well.  i dont really drink stouts but i do drink this beer because it is perfectly balanced and just overall amazing to sip on.
3889,Anchor Porter,4.06,poured from 12-ounce bottle into a willi becher glass. appearance leaves nothing to be desired. cola-colored body with ruby highlights a thick long-lasting light tan head good retention and lacing. for my money this reaches its peak at near room temperature. roasty and a little bitter with notes of caramel chocolate toffee and dark fruit coming to the fore. medium-light in body with a bit of astringence and a sour note lingering on the finish. overall an outstanding beer. hopefully anchor will find some way to carry on.
3890,Anchor Porter,4.12,bottled on 03-28-2023. enjoyed on 7/30/2023 this my second bottle. i had the first on on 7/28/2023. for some reason this bottle is better and has more robust flavor. impressive head with a aggressive pour leaves plenty of lacing. flavor is roast chocolate caramel and a hint of dark fruit. plus a micro hint of coffee. rather smooth and slightly bitter overall. a solid beer kinda old school.
3891,Anchor Porter,4,bottled on: 06-09-22  a - pitch black pour with a frothy layer of creamy foam resting on top.  s - nice roasty chocolate and coffee malt aroma with a touch of char.  t - chocolate roast a slight bit of coffee some toffee and a hint of dark fruit. finishes with a pleasing lingering chocolate coffee char. theres also a very slight bit of astringency.  m - medium body with soft prickly carbonation.  o - solid and glad to finally find this one first time ever noticing it on the shelf.
3892,Anchor Porter,4.38,roasty smooth flavors of cocoa fruit (raisin and prune come to mind) slightly spicy. sits well with me and sips well with me. an old favorite a classic great porter beer.
3893,Anchor Porter,4.14,appearance: pours a dark nearly black color with a mild tan head. srm of 23. (3.75)  aroma: strong aromas of english and dark chocolate some coffee and hints of dark malt and molasses underneath. (4.00)  favor: strong flavors of bittersweet chocolate dried cocoa powder with some coffee and dark malt. balanced by dry finish. (4.25)  feel: medium-bodied roasted grainy mouthfeel. balanced. (4.00)  compared to einstok icelandic porter 1/7/2023: pours similar milder aromas. more chocolate and roast. less bittersweetn chocolate and english cream. roastier dryer and more american.  compared to surly skeleton tree 1/7/2023: pours darker stronger aromas. more chocolate. less airy roast dark grain and yeast. slightly maltier and more balanced.  compared to great lakes edmund fitzgerald 3/2023: more english chocolate espresso bean dark fruit. less bittersweet chocolate dark roast bitterness.  compared to bent paddle black 3/2023: more english chocolate espresso bean dark fruit. less milk chocolate coffee roast. milder.  overall: a nice porter here with bittersweet english chocolate cocoa and roasted flavors. drinks balanced but leans dry as a porter should. a lower abv and clean yet flavorful. nicely done and balanced all around. (rating: 4.14)
3894,Anchor Porter,4.17,poured from 12oz bottle to a nonic pint glass. pours a deep rich brown with a decent dark khaki head that settled to a cap. beer is opaque. smell is roasted malt caramel and chocolate. also theres a bit of hop aroma too. taste had cocoa coffee roasted barley generic fruitiness in the finish. feel is medium bodied well-carbonated. overall this is a really nice porter with a strong hop presence yet it still remains rather well- balanced.
3895,Anchor Porter,4.72,poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. the body is inky black with a half inch of brown head with a mild pour. retention is average. the intensity of aroma is medium. there are notes of malt salted toffee rich dark chocolate and black coffee. it smells wonderful. the intensity of taste is medium high with a dryer and more hoppy flavor than the aroma suggests. normally i loath hoppy porters but anchor got this one right. with a swallow the flavor keeps going. there are flavors of toffee deep dark chocolate more black coffee than in the aroma and a long pronounced hoppy flavor thats medium in intensity. its rich and delicious. ive missed having a go to dark beer after new castle changed. this will likely be its much better replacement. i usually support local austin breweries but this is a much better beer than 512 pecan porter which is much more expensive for a four-pack compared to a six-pack of this. the thickness is just under medium. its quite dry with a low level of astringency. well i finished the bottle before i could accurately detect the level of creaminess. with its 5.6% abv im feeling a little numbness in my face. i will open another bottle tomorrow to finish this. the level of creaminess is high. the carbonation is unique. the bubbles are tiny and tickle the tongue creating a effervescent quality. it has a lot of world class qualities in the mouth feel alone. overall im amazed by how excellent this is. after trying a few beers that i didnt care for anchor porter reminded me how truly great a beer can be.
3896,Anchor Porter,4.46,tasty
3897,Anchor Porter,4.5,pours into hotel plastic cup like a stout frothy tan head big tastes of coffee chocolate and toffee/caramel for being light in abv. finishes slightly dry. delicious union made beer to celebrate labor day
3898,Anchor Porter,4.21,pours a very dark brownish color with a dark tan head. smell is of chocolate and coffee caramel and malt. taste is a nice chocolate-coffee and caramel. good tasting porter.
3899,Anchor Porter,4.17,the porter is a dark beer and i got a two finger mocha head in a nonic. the roasty chocolate smell is inviting. the taste is roasty and finishes bitter. the solid mouthfeel bites back with the lingering bitterness. overall an enjoyable porter.
3900,Anchor Porter,4.17,from the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. this classic pours a dark blackish brown with a very nice head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring thin clumping layer and shows off some nice lacing. nose of dark coffee dark cocoa moderate char and roast with subtle dark fruit hints. flavors hit the mark with dark fruit notes of black and raspberry dark cocoa dark coffee char and balanced sweet caramel malts. nice mouth feel; medium full body edging towards medium smooth lightly coating light carbonation and a balanced char and roast finish that is lightly dry.  overall---excellence!  cheers
3901,Anchor Porter,4.15,opened this fresh 12 ouncer and drank it straight from the bottle. this is a superb everyday porter richly delicious tastes of coffee mild chocolate dark malt. drinks light. finishes crisp. excellent american display of the style.
3902,Anchor Porter,4.54,delightful dark roast coffee flavors with a hint of chocolate. crisp light and ultimately refreshing. about as good a porter as any ive tried.
3903,Framboos,4.29,look - clear copper with nice white head incredible rimming smell and taste - funky grainy raspberry feel - medium body fizzy slight bite overall - really fantastic
3904,Framboos,4.6,bottled: 18 dec 2019 reviewed: 16 june 2023  a: pous crystal clear copper in color moderate sized bright white head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. looks still in the glass’s 4.25  s: aroma is immediate raspberries hay and raw wheat. initially quite floral which then cedes to funky notes of slightly pungent cheese. i can’t say that it smells particularly sour but there’s some lactic tartness and citrus rind. quite complex and a wonderful nose. 4.75  t: taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever. taste is quite tart and sour but it’s not as puckering as many lambics. the raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent not sure to what extent that’s due to the age. 4.5  m/d: mouthfeel is lighter side of medium bodied with a big but appropriate carbonation and incredible drinkability. i could drink this all day. 5  o: a wonderful beer no doubt. not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as i think i prefer cantillon rose de gabrinus when it comes to raspberry lambics (and i’ve surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years). regardless still wonderful and i would have a fridge full of this on the regular if it was readily available. 4.5
3905,Framboos,4.51,375 ml. bottle. bottling date 18dec19 best before 26 oct 39.  gentle to moderate pour yields a one inch white head over a hazy solid golden body with fleeting lacing.  nose of funk oak and raspberries.  taste mirrors nose with mostly tart raspberry flavors oak tannins and funk.  wonderful mouthfeel almost perfect for the style.  overall i know its quite expensive at $29.99 a 375 ml. bottle but do yourself a favor and grab one if you see one! cheers!!
3906,Framboos,4.32,i picked this up last week at vintage estates wine and beer in boardman oh. my favorite beer store. this 375 ml was very expensive but i have been after this beer for 15 years. also got hommage and may save that for beer rating/review #2k. bottled on 18 dec 2019.  a- body is a uniformly hazy orange with a hint of pink. perhaps sunset in color. there is no head or lacing to speak of.  s- the nose is complex yet simple. tart raspberries cheesecloth funk oak barrel breadiness.  t- the flavor is much like the nose- sweet and tart authentic raspberries upfront with a light bready yeast backbone. the finish is quite sour but a softness from the oak barrel lingers on with some sourness long after you swallow.  f- medium carbonation and a medium weight body. there is a lot of acidity in the body with a light bread yeast feel too.  o- this beer is truly world class. its the definition of a traditional fruit lambic and it is brewed so carefully and so well. it definitely gets better and you appreciate it more as it goes down. its quite expensive so if you dont like more traditional sours or you dont like raspberries than dont bother.
3907,Framboos,4.6,l: pours a nice dark red pink color with a small foamy head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass.  s: lots of earthy funky brett hit the nose followed by a good tart raspberry and some other tart fruit.  t: lots of earthy funk tart and sour mix well with the brett and then finishes with a touch of raspberry. utterly fantastic.  f: good fizzy carbonation and medium body.  o: this beer is utterly fantastic
3908,Framboos,4.55,slightly hazy dark pink body (the haze is possibly due to my practice of not decanting belgian beers).  impressively earthy and funky on the nose. theres a hint of raspberry but it doesnt stand out strongly.  wonderful raspberry flavor on the palate without overwhelming. moderately sour but more funky. not quite as delicate as other fruited lambics. drinks a bit fuller than the 5% abv would suggest.
3909,Framboos,4.24,375 ml bottle (2018/2019 vintage) poured into a snifter. pours a clear dark yellow/pink. not much of a head or lacing. the bottom of the bottle contains lots of yeast/sediment which changes the appearance to turbid dark brown/red. aroma features fresh raspberries and funk (leather barnyard) with some oak and malt. some green apple/lemon as well. flavor is similar but with a malty sweetness that i cant quite describe; almost like someone added a shot of simple syrup. this detracts from the overall flavor profile. moderate tartness. moderate funk. nice fruit. overall its solid but not something id feel the need to buy again. maybe its better with less time in the bottle but then again it does claim to have a 20-year drinking window.
3910,Framboos,4.46,2019 750ml cork and cage bottle poured into a yeti  a- hazy pale orange brown with a ruby hue one finger foamy white head with short retention  s- plenty of tart raspberries up front followed by some barnyard funk notes of hay horse blanket and acidic tartness  t- super tart up front with a redo berry note that hits the back of the mouth. mid palate gives some funky notes of lemon apple pear and sharp acidic tartness. the finish gives more sharp tart raspberry  m- medium body with moderate carbonation foamy mouthfeel and a dry tart finish
3911,Bathams Best Bitter,4.15,bottled and presumably not bottle conditioned considering the pour presented with a clear straw coloured body with good white head aroma is malty and yeasty some syrup sweet grain thin a slight lemon bitter finish
3912,Bathams Best Bitter,4.8,this is one of the best keep secret drink from england. just only a few pubs at midland do carry this special beer. i was so lucky my friend collin bought a case to me when he was visit me. judge from the package and bottle you wont even consider to have a second look.  poured the beer in my small westvleteren tasting glass. copper color fluid with a little head. only little carbonation visible in the fluid.  but once you have a little sip then magical did happened. there is not bitter at all. the flavor is quite sweet with sugary malt and hop fruitiness. bathams achieves the balance really well. the more you drink it. the more you like it.
3913,Bathams Best Bitter,4.75,my first pint of bathams was drunk at the bull & bladder during the long hot summer of 76. my first rating is based on that unforgettable experience. my second pint was drunk 40 years later at the hook norton beer festival 2016. it tasted exactly as i remembered (and often dreamt about). straw coloured. little to no head yet still with a soft carbonation. floral and hoppy with an initial sweetness that draws to a light bitter finish. hints of caramel emerge gradually and are balanced by the unassuming hop profile. must be drunk from a cask via a hand pulled beer engine and as close to the brewery as possible. a session ale without peers. good \delph to you.
3914,Bathams Best Bitter,4.28,500ml bottle bought online from tuckers maltings  poured a lovely clear golden colour. white head poured pretty thick and foamy then faded to good covering... lots of carbonation bubbles drift slowly to the surface... light sticky lacing...  aroma - quite peppery and grassy salty notes light toasted bready malts butter hints bitter oranges hints of almond coppery metallic traces citric hops light herbal notes some graininess faint caramel...  taste is almost perfect... lovely quite sweet bready malts mixed with some bitter orange marmalade peppery and grassy hops floral honey some biscuity notes pear and grapefruit fruitiness slight hint of sulphur  feel - smooth and creamy with just a slight sharpness coming through... light bodied... this is the perfect example of a session beer - extremely quaffable at only 4.3%...  overall - as good an example of a sessionable english bitter as youll find... outstanding...
3915,Bathams Best Bitter,4.43,at last i can review this beer in its best (cask) version.  drank at the railway bridgnorth shropshire during the camra beerfest.  a straw blonde colour with a firm white foam head very light for an english bitter. light coloured bitters have been around the black country for a long time this is the best.  no huge aroma just a few hoppy smells and some malt maybe but it also has a floral fragrance too almost perfumed. you have to search for the scent though.  for so light a bitter the flavours are tremendous a true great british bitter.  the beer is just a joy to drink i love it.
3916,Bathams Best Bitter,4,had this also on cask at the unicorn along with their mild. lovely golden color with creamy head. sweet smells nice malty flavor and moderate hoppiness makes this brew very easy to put down and get another one! wish i could have some more of this brew. hopefully someday i can return to the west midlands.
3917,Bathams Best Bitter,4.6,a very drinkable black country best bitter from daniel batham & co from brierley hill in the west midlands. the best bitter is a light yellow beer almost lagerish in appearance the finish is dry and hoppy. bathams best bitter is one of the midlands finest a very smooth refreshing drink worth seeking out.
3918,Bathams Best Bitter,4.45,this pale yellow beer is always a pleasure. slightly sweet with a dry hoppy after taste makes it very refreshing. good sweetish nose nice head that settles well and very easy to drink.  one of my favourite session beers !  only available at the few bathams pubs and a few free houses in the west midlands wolverhampton/walsall area.
3919,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,5,närke kaggen stormakts porter 2019  yields a night black color with a smaller mohagony colored head.  the aromas lead with ground coffee honey dipped milk chocolate and matured spicy wood. there is a leathery quality in this accompanied by lighter licorice and a note of caramel.  mouthfeel on this is rich heavier bodied with a well fitting lower level of carbonation which manages to unfold a late effervescence.  taste offers strong notes of bitter chocolate roasted espresso beans dried figs and a well nuanced amount of rich sweet chestnut honey. reveals an intriguing creaminess then with additional camp fire smoke on top blending well into the bitter chocolate maltiness in this together with a lighter note of caramel and mansion dust. finishes with a lingering herb dryness blending well into the coffee and chocolate bitterness in this intensified by the warming spicy and gnarly oak of the beer.  fantastic complex and intense with a great balance to it. this is as good as it gets regarding this style of beer with a beautiful carefully way of crafting a complex yet elegant beer.
3920,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.5,smokey
3921,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.94,had low expectations. but my gawd! this beer blew me away. easily the best porter i’ve ever had.
3922,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.25,excellent porter. one of the best. roasty complex bold. super challenging to acquire but definitely worth the chase. got to try high coast next to it too. amazing combo!!!
3923,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.63,pours jet black with a small tan head. intense roast bordering on smokey. chocolate. definitely some bourbon heat along with vanilla infused oak. quite dry. heat of the alcohol overwhelms my palate making tough to judge ibus. full bodied long lasting finish.
3924,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.44,bottle rbesg 2007 in glasgow grand tasting. pitch black colour creamy brown head. very nice aroma of chocolate and roasted malts hints of oak. intensely rich and complex flavour: oaky vinous roasty chocolate liquorice. an excellent beer but so is the ordinary stormaktsporter.
3925,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.36,l: standard golden yellow lager little lacing s: extremely sweet like sour apple candy not like beer. t: still pretty bad. burnt vanilla corn and green apples (standard for minhas brewing similar to the boxer beers). the harsh taste masks the high alcohol content. f: not as bad as the taste but weird texture luckily goes away quick. carbonation is reasonable. overall: only buy this for the awesome can design and to prank your friends by asking them to drink it.
3926,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.27,this stuff is barely drinkable as with all high gravity malt liquors this one is sweet and it has very little head and it leaves no lacing. this one is no good try at your own risk
3927,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,2.77,jaguar hi gravity lager. nice powerful name. got this from my son he likes cool looking cans. i think he had one and said here dad you can review these...ha ho lets go. hope this is a step up from my previous malt liquor reviews. poured into a pint glass nice golden yellow with a lot of head but left quick. they aroma ah what can i say i really dont know what the hell it is...perfumy metallic damp straw thats starting to mold? not overpowering but different. taste very carbonated feel that leaves a really smooth texture on the tongue a grassy wheatie slightly watery brew. as the brew continues to warm the smoothness hangs in there even as the metal becomes more present. an interesting note a white wine like flavour is coming on kinda like a carlo rossi jug wine chablis. this is beginning to go down too easy trouble is on the way. not something id seek out but too late it found me. good snough i mean enough ;/
3928,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.7,part of a trifecta from the liquor store. we had gotten this in by mistake along with other melanie products. the manager offered me a can of this along with evil eye (we were liquidating stock) i took it home and poured it into my jack daniels pint glass. it was a pale straw color. winey along with green apples. legs were left on the glass. after finishing this i curled up into the fetal position and wanted to die.
3929,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.66,jaguar high gravity lager has a medium white fizzy quickly-dissipating head no lacing and a clear very bubbly yellow-golden appearance. the aroma is of subtle and sickening green apple grain husks barley sickly-sweetness and a shadow of hops. the mouthfeel is light to medium and jaguar finishes somewhat crisp and refreshing but also somewhat harsh. this is pretty hard to stomach and i think its not even worth trying. avoid!  rjt
3930,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.5,this beer will immediately make you question life. why am i doing this to myself?  pale anemic gold color flecks of lace that ring the glass. looks yellow almost green. not much in the way of retention dead glassy surface after a few minutes.  smells like white grapes sweet cereal froot loops vitamins and a general lack of self respect.  tastes like the same. crap adjuncts added sugars. sticky mealy astringent feel. deadening alcohol on the palate. sweet grainy taste some fusels. pretty rough though not the utter worst ive experienced. this is nothing more than a cheap buzz in a shitty package. avoid if you possess any shred of dignity.  yes i bought this for the stupid can graphics.
3931,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.49,big thanks to chris (spycow) for finding this in an out-of-the-way wisconsin gas station. apparently this was less than a dollar. served in a beeradvocate taster glass.  a - quick-dissolving white foam settles to a near-transparent cap leaving spotty lace behind. slightly lighter than earthquake but similarly bubbly.  s - compared to earthquake this is downright terrible. alcohol rotting fruit and garbage and god knows what else.  t - taste is a tiny bit better as it dials down the rotten flavors and replaces them with sickeningly cloying sweetness. not as boozy as some of the other malt liquors although this is a light one at 8.3%.  m - surprisingly chewy texture with a dry finish but tooth-coating stickiness. not as much heat as earthquake unsurprisingly. carbonation is moderate to low. somewhat indescribable and not in a good way.  d - this may be the worst true malt liquor we\ve had so far although there\s always a chance one of the other gems will usurp the throne. a must-try for lovers of bad beer.
3932,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.21,brewed and bottled by mountain crest in monroe wisconsin. this means brewed by the minhas craft brewery. maybe it used to be brewed by city for melanie.  this 8.3% malt liquor pours a glowing yet dark golden yellow in color. there is a quarter to half inch of foamy white head. the aroma is strangely fruity for a lager. there is cherry green apple tropical fruity and a strange chemically-alcohol aroma. i hope this tastes better than it smells. whoa it does not taste better. in fact it tastes worse. this is like a chemical fruity alcohol cleaning product. this is atrocious and all but undrinkable. if your goal is to get drunk cheap there are better-tasting alternatives.
3933,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.03,poured a sort of bright yellow color with a good amount of quickly dissipating white head it. smell is solid alcohol and not good at that. smells terrible no redeeming beer smell qualities at all. taste is god-awful. i wish i was exaggerating but this is complete shit. its only 8.3% but tastes like pure alcohol. got some bubbles towards the end light mouthfeel but the tastes ruins any chance of this beer going down smoothly. its surprising but this beer is even worse than i remembered it being. i will not be drinking this ever again.
3934,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.18,clear pale straw color with a puffy white collar that leaves a little bit of lacing.  aroma was malty sweet with a little sugar mixed in. maybe some graininess.  taste was horrible. cloying sweetness that just astounds me. why? not quite as wretched as in a minahs brew but its still wretched.  feel was slick and oily and nothing pleasing.  i tried to guzzle as much as i could but could only handle a handful of sips...drinking any more is a waste. good thing the drain is always thirsty.
3935,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.81,in honor of the recent lunacy in our neighbor state i decided to go with a self-proclaimed union made beer out of monroe wi. gotta love cans labeled with animals. sconnies...  a: golden blonde with a weak white head. good clarity and looks like a light summer beer.  s: corn musty unidentified adjunct and a bit of banana. pretty mild but what is there is not desirable.  t: sweet and fruity. not sure where this is coming from but i get lime and cloying banana. strange and not in a particularly good way.  m; smooth with fine carbonation and a bit of alcohol bite.  flavor is bizarre like some zima somehow found its way into the tank. this started out as a peculiarity but by the time i finished the 22oz it was a nauseating chore. not quite bad enough to make the list of worst malt liquors but this is classic skip enjoyment and go straight to intoxication.
3936,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.49,served in a snifter.  and swillfest 1.5 rolls on! and in geodesic snifters no less! what better vessel for such a libation eh? when i saw this can a few months ago my mind pulled for me to purchase it. but i demurred. then upon seeing this on a more recent beer run to kenosha i felt it had to come into my possession.  which leads to today. it pours a clear apple juice topped by a finger or so of quick-dying white foam. the nose is indeed how senor chandler (below) described it with cotton candy stalks dancing with remnants of vinyl and motor oil (i dont get the rest of the factory but then again i aint woody be i?). the simple strangeness of it is actually pretty impressive though in the wrong way. the taste takes a slightly different tack more closely resembling some yammy wd-40. yeah. seriously. this is some godawful shit lemme tell ya. the body feels heavier than it probably is (bad tastes weigh more than good ones maybe?) with a light moderate carbonation a watery feel and a dry finish. overall nothing about this horrid thing makes me want to ever drink it again. it was all i could do to muster up the strength to down the rest of my glass hoping against hope that only the minimum would actually touch my tongue and harangue my buds. only one word for this: yicchleggh.  on a strange note feeling oddly empowered (if that\s the right word) i decided to add some tabasco to what remained in my glass after emptying the can. i dripped in some of mike\s old sauce (best by label read 03/2010) and gulped some down much to the painful glee of those witnessing the act. to my surprise the taste was akin to crazy ed\s. now where\s the shooting star running over my head?
3937,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.68,served in a snifter  thanks to tmoney2591 for giving me this...i think  there is too much malt liquor for my liking. this liquor pours a golden color with not much head at all. the smell is equivalent to sniffing pepto bismal...im not sure why. this beer is odd but hell its jaguar. the taste felt like a jaguar mauled my taste buds. there is an acrid horrible feeling that i wish i had never ever ever tasted. the mouthfeel is smooth but horrible i dont know how else to describe it. the drinkability is dont.
3938,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,2.31,thanks to woodychandler for the trade.poured from a 16 oz. can. has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is mild alcohol the only thing really coming through. taste is  uh well lets say you can taste the 8.3% in there some notes of plastic not very good. feels light in the mouth and is not very drinkable. overall this is a beer best avoided.
3939,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.25,i can\t believe it! here is a beer that is already a solid f albeit after just two reviews and here comes the canquest (tm). i am not holding out much hope.  another union made can! i am a unionist but this kind of thing makes me shake my head in wonder. i tried really to generate some head but to no avail. the white foam fell as quickly as i could pour. color was a pretty golden-yellow with ne-quality clarity. nose was the unpleasant combination of plastics factory and cotton candy. how do they achieve this? it is ungodly! mouthfeel was thin-to medium with an inherent sweetness that would throw a diabetic into a coma. omfg! this is nearly unfit for human cansumption. finish left me gasping for air. oof.
3940,Tripel Van De Garre,4.99,outstanding all the way around. everyone on here is describing it well. the only thing i want to add is a found the beautiful head almost marshmallowy in texture right off the pour. don’t miss this if you see it.
3941,Tripel Van De Garre,4.78,on tap at novare res portland. long time want of mine and certainly did not disappoint. honey bread fruity yeast ester herbal hop and warming alcohol abound. my favorite tripel to date and thats saying something given fin du monde was one of the first beers that got me into craft in the first place  96/100 -- surprisingly the highest aggregate score of any beer ive had so far after 6 years of reviewing
3942,Tripel Van De Garre,4.89,enjoyed on draft at novare res in portland me  a beautiful and delicious tripel. served with a huge and long lasting fluffy white head. smell is yeasty with burnt sugar notes. taste of banana clove and candied sugar - sweet but not too sweet. alcohol is warming but not overwhelming. very well balanced. a delicious beer and one of the finest triples that i have had yet.  highly recommended!
3943,Tripel Van De Garre,4.4,750ml bottle into a tulip. coded 17ku.  looks magnificent. hazy medium yellow body with a huge bright white head leaving a sheet of lacing.  not much on the nose a clean fresh aroma.  excellent taste. sweet with a light spice note. smooth clean. light but with strength. abv well hidden. so smooth but with a warming touch.  mouth above medium finish sweet spiced and warming.  overall spectacular beer. so glad to be enjoying this one on a cool spring evening.
3944,Tripel Van De Garre,4.91,just had this in draft yesterday. served in a de garre glass. absolutely wonderful! so much going on in this one! overall i rated at 4.75 but rated strictly as a tripel style i’d give it a 5. i love tripel and this was quite simply the best i’ve had. if you can find it try it!
3945,Tripel Van De Garre,4.48,on tap at the gd bierhuis in prague. wow didn’t expect to see this. never had a chance to drink a tripel of this quality. their traditional carolus is outstanding but this is so much richer and deeper. darker in color with a deeper range of flavors. sweet satisfying just wow.
3946,Tripel Van De Garre,5,quite delicious with lots of foam. had 2 glasses of de garre in bruges at the pub and a 750 ml bottle at home twice. one of my favorites! even the foam tasted great! kind of like a cream soda beer...
3947,Tripel Van De Garre,4.55,fantastic body on this beer. i have had this from the bottle but i long to try this in bruge on tap. it is a masterpiece.
3948,Tripel Van De Garre,4.94,750ml bottle poured into a de garre glass.  appearance: pours a deep golden with ample head with cloud puffs that recede into fine lace  smell: alcohol and yeast esters with simmered cane syrup  taste: follows the nose with some graininess interwoven with the alcohol and yeast developing into a more malty finish  mouthfeel: full-bodied but dry enough to beg for another sip i am impressed with the carbonation that is just at the point of cumbersome but pulls back just in time  overall: i have experience this beer on tap at the incredible de garre pub in bruges. the bottled version is still one of the top belgian tripels you can have in the us. i cant wait to go back and enjoy it in bruges.
3949,Tripel Van De Garre,4.75,poured from a 750 ml bottle into a chalice glass appearance – the beer pours a hazy golden amber color with a peach like hue. upon pouring there is a thick billowy two finger head of white foam. the head very slowly fades over quite a long time leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma is of a sweet candied sugar smell mixed with lots of apricot peach and a bit of pear. at the same time there are some light cracker malt and caramel aromas as well as a nice yeast cake smell. other aroma of spice is there as well with lots of coriander some clove and hints of black pepper and lemongrass. a very nice aroma indeed. taste – the taste follows the nose very well. it begins with a light cracker malt with a very strong apricot and peach backbone flavor. these are mingled with lots of candied sugar some candy apple and a little bit of sweet grape. spice flavors of coriander and lemongrass are there right from the start both of which grow a bit stronger as the taste advances. a yeast flavor develops along the taste transition and is joined with some clove and a light pepper. the sweet seems to surge at the end of the taste profile producing a sweet and very bright taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is very high. for the sweet flavors and the style the feel is spot on and makes this one a very easy and pleasant sipper. overall – a fantastic brew. the flavors are bright and approachable with a blend of spice and malt to make for one very flavorful and easy drinker. at 11 % abv with is dangerously drinkable. a truly fantastic brew.
3950,Tripel Van De Garre,4.44,had this on draft 7/15/22 @ sleeping village.  semi-opaque golden appearance.  huge off-white head; nice tree-rung lace.  banana clove & tart lemon funk notes in the nose.  creamy thick mouthfeel...silky smooth.  caramel clove banana & mild booze heat flavors.  decadent creamy thick & borderline heavenly. christmas eve shit bro.
3951,Tripel Van De Garre,4.6,poured on draft at the brewery in bruges. pours a nice light yellow with a significant amount of head. the nose is honey wheat vanilla sweet candy toffee and a light citrus note. the taste is out of this world. honey cookies lemon cream wheat candy bread vanilla and a slight bitterness from hops. the mouthfeel is creamy and a bit dry. overall just a wonderful experience.
3952,Kirin Ichiban,3.59,polished brass color with a decent head that fizzily drops to a white sheet leaving little lacing. nose is toasty malt sweetness with a crisp mineral whiff and a caramelish malt sweetness thats neither pleasant nor unpleasant but which is most definitely there. it is round-feeling and has a pretty rich malt character all the way through the finish medium carbonation. honestly a more complex beer than i was expecting but still a little hollow and one-note in a way industrial lager all is. there is something about this can that is making me wonder but what its lightly oxidized but regardless a decent enough beer.  3.75...3.5...3.5...3.75...3.75
3953,Kirin Ichiban,5,a very nice offering in the style. smooth and clean. it has a crisp finish. a fine beer to enjoy with any meal. it’s very refreshing and very crushable. i recommend it. cheers!
3954,Kirin Ichiban,2.97,mild maltiness standard enough. inoffensive notes of malt yeast and hops. decently crisp.
3955,Kirin Ichiban,4.66,tastes good; bitter hops tastes; chewy. i am content with this beer forever. nice head that lasts. great with japanese and korean anju (drinking snacks).
3956,Kirin Ichiban,3.1,l: crystal clear golden body with lively carbonation. 2 finger white head that has excellent retention.  s: pilsner malt saaz hops  t: euro lager like. nothing special but not bad.  f: thin and fizzy  o: for $9.99 a 6 pack i’d drink again. not a terrible beer. not good either.
3957,Kirin Ichiban,2.1,japanese beer brewed in germany. interesting. is anything about it actually japanese aside from the strange goaty dragon thing on the label? cool bottle design i like it.  refreshing aroma of dry slightly aromatic hops. small bubbles in the head looks pretty good.  yes its definitely different from a usual german pilsner. the hops are a little more aromatic sophisticated and kind of japanesey. its super light and dry a bit like asahi but the hops seem to have more flavour and its kind of sweet. this would go perfectly with sushi for sure..  its the kind of beer that is refreshing initially but becomes a little boring as you drink more of it. its a little too sweet for me and needs some more hops to balance the sweetness but i do like the hops flavour and the light dryness. but its nothing special aside from the rather unique goat alien dragon thing.
3958,Cisk XS Extra Lager,2.2,**performed blind tasting**  appearance- light golden straw color with a very thing white head. smell - smells sweet with hints of corn and alcohol aroma taste - sweet pale malts corn and alcohol - tastes like an american malt liquor. mouthfeel - too thin and pale to mask the high alcohol.  overall - might as well drink a steel reserve.
3959,Cisk XS Extra Lager,3.2,poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smells of fruits some alcohol. taste is dominated by alcohol a bit of grains and malts. feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. overall this is a decent brew but nothing special.
3960,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.87,i found this single 33oml brown bottle at the binnys store in plainfield il for $1.99 so this is not a cheap beer as that price comes out to $12 a 6 pack. the freshness date on the back label says may 9th of 2o1o and this is already july of 2o1o so i realize i am reviewing an out of date bottle.  the beer poured a hazy yellowish/orange color and made a 1 finger fizzy white head that disappeared in under 3o seconds. there was very little lacing present.  sweet grainy smell mixed with alcohol and call me crazy but im also getting a trace of fruit - perhaps orange.  this beer has an odd taste. very sweet malt and grains steeped in alcohol. i cant get the alcohol off my tongue. i dont know if there are citrus hops in here but there is some underlying orange flavoring to this as well but overall it is not a tasty beer. its an alcoholic mess.  theres enough sugary sweetness in here to make it medium to full bodied but even the relatively high carbonation cannot cut through the heavy amount of alcohol. alcohol coats the tongue and leaves a nasty sweet alcoholic aftertaste.  not a very drinkable beer but it will at least give you a buzz with just one.
3961,Cisk XS Extra Lager,3.07,this is an interesting brew from malta a small island off of italy that used to be controlled by the british. this is there version of a strong lager and this is a good example how the euro strong lager and british influence combine to make a interesting brew.  this is a pale yellow and crystal body. the smell is sweet with a nice hop bitterness.  the taste is crisp almost like a good euro lager with more abv.  not the best beer ever but decent. i really dont know why it got so many bad reviews. this is a pretty good beer much better than a d or f.
3962,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.44,a brew from the fine mediterranean island country of malta eh? 12 oz bottle with a best before stamp of feb 10. pours a clear medium gold color with a pretty nice cap of white foam that lasts pretty long for a euro lager. leaves some decent lacing as well.  smell is nose-wrinklingly bad. smells like a homeless skunk living under the overpass that just drank a fifth of cheap vodka and shat all over himself. okay maybe not quite that bad but i do ask myself: dare i take a sip? smells so damn boozy with corn-syrup cloying sweetness.  whew...those poor poor maltanian bastards! this stuff is wicked bad. imagine a 40 oz of malt liquor boiled down to about 12 oz becoming the consistency of thin syrup and adding 3 ounces of grain alcohol...that is pretty much what this tastes like. sweetness is ridiculously cloying and the beer is viscous as hell feeling in the mouth. avoid at all costs unless you are a glutton for punishment. am i going to finish this bitch? maybe but only because i had to buy two of these mfers cause the first one exploded in my freezer.
3963,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.69,pours out a nice yellowy-orange color with a bit of head deceiving me into thinking this could be a good find.  however upon smelling all i get is a grainy alcohol smell with perhaps a bit of sweetness. i think this beer is 9% abv so i guess i can accept that but have a feeling this could be a bad omen.  the taste is really not enjoyable. ive had plenty of stronger beers but none of them tasted like alcohol as much as this. really overpowers any of the light sweetness in the flavor.  again the alcohol dominance didnt really help the mouthfeel.  i would not drink another one unless someone paid me to. im not really familiar with the euro strong lager style so im not sure if its an acquired taste but i dont think ill be acquiring it any time soon.
3964,Cisk XS Extra Lager,2.14,bright goldenrod (almost orange) with a few tiny flakes being buffeted about by a few tiny bubble streams. either the beer isnt filtered or the filter didnt have very small pores. the cream colored crown looks pretty good. its richly creamy and is doing a bang-up job with lace especially considering the abv and the probable lack of hops.  the nose is similar to the nose on every other euro strong lager on the face of the earth. it features vodka-soaked grain with a side order of noble hops. a very small side order. maybe its the american in me but malt liquor smells and tastes better than most esls.  ive had worse. less jet fuel flavor and more... uh... anything else would have been an improvement. this is far from refined beer but then i knew that going in. it has an odd sort of charm if you like high-octane lagers that numb the tongue. i cant imagine that applies to many beer drinkers... who dont live on skid row.  if youve had any of the euro strong lagers from eastern europe then you already know what cisk extra lager tastes like. think pale malt and grass steeped in grain alcohol then cut with mineral water. moderate sweetness and moderate bitterness keep things moderately uninteresting to the end.  the mouthfeel isnt horrible if you like them on the full and quiet side. a lingering slickness is kept from being stickiness by the solvent quality of the ethanol. no one drinks this stuff for the mouthfeel anyway. they drink it for the brainfeel.  cisk xs is my second maltese beer and is my second lousy maltese beer. on the positive side after two or three bottles the rest should go down pretty easily. if you decide to take the plunge and buy a bottle (not recommended) dont forget the brown paper bag.
3965,Cisk XS Extra Lager,3.78,nose is grainy with very soft noble hops. smells okay.  pours a medium yellow good clarity mild creamy head with lasting retention. looks pretty good.s  creamy malty sweet tart and a little bitter. soft sweet malt makes a great flavor for the smooth creamy body that lends itself to nice carbonation. grainy and toasty with biscuit and nut tones; warm and inviting. somewhat tart/sour noble hops add a little grounding and then almost disappear. theres a little hop flavor - clean flowery and earthy/herbal. finishes fairly clean slight nutty malt just slight. tastes good. feels very good. good drinkability.  i dont know what beer the rest of yall reviewed but this is quite pleasant.
3966,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.95,pours into a pint glass with a hazy deep yellow color. thin white head disapates quickly leaving more scum than lace behind.  aroma is sweet and grainy like canned corn.  flavor is also on the sweet side. like many a macro its mostly corn or rice from what i can tell. it has an awful grain alcohol heat to it almost like a shot of cheap vodka was added.  mouthfeel is pretty bad too with medium body alcohol burn and too much carbonation. drinkability is poor. i wouldnt be looking for another even if it was free.
3967,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.59,poured into an american pint glass this beer is a very pale quite clear straw-gold color with a substantial 2-finger head on top. the nose is quite grainy with a little hint of solvent. ugh an extremely sweet nearly cloyingly sweet beer with no hint of anything hoppy together with medicinal very harsh alcohol. thin-bodied and watery and nearly undrinkable. i couldnt finish a single glass--ill have to find someone to give this away to.
3968,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.98,appearance: its very clear and a lighter gold color. it has a foamy white head that maybe reaches a finger deep. it receded pretty quickly and left an average lacing behind. very average.  smell: its very sweet smelling up front. theres some earthy/grainy notes. smells a tad vegetal. im definitely picking up a slight big of corn. alcohol comes through very strong. at 9% i expected that to some degree. but its more prevalent than it should be.  taste: mother of god. someone needs to head down to malta and teach those doods how to brew some beer. wow. this is one sweet and sugary brew. theres some light fruity notes (pear and apple mostly). light caramel/toffee flavors add more sweetness. it is grainy and earthy. theres a light vegetal corn-like flavor. alcohol is very prevalent and downright hot. its offensive. finishes very hot.  mouthfee/drinkability: its close to being thick. carbonation feels pretty light. its not smooth but its not bad. this is probably its strength (if you want to call it that). drinkability is poor. the flavor is not good and its way too hot. theres nothing to really enjoy here.  i picked up this beer a few days ago out of curiosity. i was told it was bad. its actually worse than i expected. i cant pick out a flaw here or there to pick on. it needs so much work all across the board. i wouldnt recommend it. well maybe if youre looking for a beer from malta. but theres got to be a better one than this right?
3969,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.91,a: much like the original lager poured a crystal clear golden-orange with a frothy paper white head that was 2 fingers high and displayed a very good retention rate. visible carbonation was light while the lacing left a thin film sheeting behind.  s: the nose yielded fresh corn on the cob fresh grains with some dried hay and sweet corn fructose. overall found this to be rather uneventful when compared to their cisk lager which was more aromatic and hoppier. this was average at best with some corn liquor detection.  t: the flavor was overly sweet with some sweet corn green corn stalks and a medicinal taste that was hard to describe reminded me of walking down a sterile hospital hall. some sour bittering with fermented fruit which tasted more like some prison hooch. overall no real flavor just corn meal and alcohol.  m: slick very oily and was light bodied leaving a sour corny finish.  d: drinkability was not good as to be expected. didnt really care to finish this one and was a struggle to justify why. a huge disappointment when compared to its original lager which was more hoppy grainy and flavorful this one came off as cheap corn/malt liquor and comes with a non recommend and a cheers to their original lager.
3970,Cisk XS Extra Lager,2.24,a - pours crystal clear and light gold. head is pure white and tops out at around half inch. retention is average. a fairly healthy amount of lace clings to the sides of the glass. not a bad looking brew. looks refreshing overall.  s - sweeter malt aromas are first to radiate from this one. some honey here some pale malt there. not cloying but i can already tell this beer could be very sweet. alot of graininess pushes through about midway. hot alcohol finishes things off.  t - sweet and hot. pale malt honey sugar and more pale malt kind of get shoved on to the palate by a burning alcohol flavor. just a hint of apple combines with the sweetness but that is just not even close to enough to bring balance. big grainy flavors are present but still cant balance the flavor too well.  m - on the fuller side of medium bodied with light carbonation that seems to work well with the brew. finish is hot and sweet while staying clean.  d - drinkability is really not looking good for this brew. too sweet and too hot. it would be best to just start all over with this brew. take it back to the drawing board and start tweaking until something a little better wass produced. not recommended at all.
3971,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.88,i was absolutely not impressed. im not sure if the beer i drank was skunk or if it tastes like that when it is fresh. i like many others i am sure thought it would be at least a decent buy because of brewery location but i was so wrong. waste of my money and time. i would almost rather be drinking a macrobrew.  appearance was flat with very little lace to the glass. there wasnt much of a smell but if i had to describe it i would say rubbing alcohol. not a smooth tasting brew at all. mouth feel was about average with a good amount of carbonation.
3972,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.06,this is by far the worst beer i have ever tasted. to be honest i couldnt give you an accurate review because the beer upset my gag reflex and i could not get past the second sip. all i remember was pure torment.  the smell was putrid and grainy and it had a rough alcohol taste.  i wish i could give it a zero in all categories (except appearance) because it was truly the most offensive liquid i have ever drank.
3973,Cisk XS Extra Lager,1.03,glass: pokal glass temp: chilled to approx 40 degrees  very light yellow colored liquid. like honey water (not in a good way). only slightly more yellow color than your average bmc product. good two-finger white foamy head that leaves a thin film on top with no lacing. not very appealing looking actually.  sweet sugarey band-aids mixed with artificial fruit flavoring dominate the nose. smells similar to redbull really. very slight malt scent is detected.  oh my god its foul. imagine if you gave someone a tumbler of tequila and redbull (why?) on ice then put out two or three cigarettes in it and let it sit on the counter until the next morning. upon waking your hungover self blindly grabs that glass and takes a drink. this beer tastes like that.  thick and putrid. honestly its that bad.  stay away! dont do it! save yourself! i picked this beer up because of its origin geographically which is malta. never heard anything about their beer making skills. now i know why. avoid at all costs.
3974,Orviamo,4.49,10 year blend poured from a 750ml bottle into a rocks glass. pours ruby red to light amber with a finger of off-white head that recedes into a collar around the rim of the glass. big oak dark cherries plums and raspberries on the nose. taste follows and it’s pretty sour. tasty though. the barrels don’t play as much of a role due to the fruit additions. thick full mouthfeel. lively carbonation and acidity. really good. think it could use a little more time.
3975,Orviamo,4.22,beautiful dark reddish beer that smells of berries and tastes of raspberry jam. probably the jammiest beer ive ever had. delicious but wished for more of the sp funk to come through on this one. still absolutely delicious. glad to have tried it.
3976,Orviamo,4.53,750ml bottle. served in a side project stemmed glass.  pours a dark reddish-brown body one finger white head good retention not much lacing or film. smells of jammy raspberry and a touch of stonefruit a bit of funk a bit of dark fruit and a bit of oak. this is the stuff of dreams. big fruit presence with a complex barrel presence- thats what an awa is supposed to be right? flavour is very similar; tons of jammy raspberry. some stone fruited plum. bright vibrant fruit sweetness intermingles in with dark fruit and the parent spirits. a bit of warming heat on the end not unlike whiskey served neat. mild fruity funk but overall the fruit is the star of the show. mouthfeel is medium bodied soft and perfectly carbonated and you get very little hint of the 10% abv aside from the warming feeling as it goes down. superb very complex. overall another wonderful heavy fruit jammed acetic wild from two of the best brewers in the us doing this type of wild ale. its quite balanced! nowhere near as sour as everyone has made it out to be even more fruit than expected and thats saying a lot.
3977,Orviamo,4.07,750ml bottle poured into a side project oversized wine glass. generously shared by erik enjoyed on 1.16.16 reviewed from tasting journal.  the beer pours a deep maroon color hues of burgundy and crimson hazy and cloudy with a bone colored head about a finger high that has good retention and lace. the aroma is very intense and very complex all of the barrels are immediately present. very fruity loads of raspberry prunes and very cherry forward strong port wine tannic acidic vinous very rich very deep with soft oak a bit of vinegar and some potent booze character. the flavors offer a bit more in terms of balance and lets each element breathe. still the various barrels are front and center loads of port wine vinous red wine and rich and oaky bourbon with a fantastic helping of raspberry and plum more plum than the nose suggested delicate and tart with some light vinegar and some warming alcohol. the mouthfeel is nice coating lively almost juicy at times with a medium body and a crisp finish.  verdict: a very intense wild ale from side project and de garde perhaps too much at once. rich complex with great depth but at times the balance is lacking and the 10% abv is very apparent.
3978,Fundamental Forces,4.25,100 rating like george burnes on a cigar here we go. large and in charge like veronica lake after a martin or three let’s ride. more solid than robert taylor as ivanhoe god save the king.
3979,Fundamental Forces,4.54,for the 2021 version! sweet and rich chocolate malty hint of vanilla and hint of bourbon barrel nose on this one! taste follows with a dark chocolate bitter floral vanilla and balanced boozy bourbon finish. a slight hint of age/oxidation can be detected on the backend but this has aged/settled in extremely well for being about a year old. the bigboi booziness that you would expect at 17+% is there but it is smooth and enjoyable...it starts to peek out a bit more as it warms. and the mouthfeel is darn near perfect. outstanding!
3980,Fundamental Forces,4.51,look - black thick syrup with slight rimming and lacing barely a head smell - a lot of vanilla bourbon barrel chocolate and booze taste - lots of vanilla chocolate great barrel feel - full body creamy light carb overall - really great beer
3981,Fundamental Forces,4.79,fundamental forces is an imperial vanilla stout from bottle logic. the one i drank had an abv 17.17% so a little stronger. i guess the fundamental force i got was the strong nuclear force the one with gluons and mesons. its recommended with brownies. i didnt have brownies but my wife suggested oreo cookies but i thought that i didnt need to double it up. this beer is like 8 oreo cookies and thats enough. maybe a little sweet but its good very good slightly boozy (well abv 17.17%) but with all the other flavors that is not an issue.  look: black with a half inch fluffy mocca colored head  aroma: chocolate vanilla bourbon  flavor: what stands out is the vanilla the bourbon the roasted malts the coffee and chocolate.  body/overall: full bodied dessert in a bottle.
3982,Double IPA,3.5,shared bottle at local tasting thanks to gunnar. abv is 8.5%. golden colour huge white head. sweetish aroma of malts and orange marmalade. distinctly hoppy flavour throughout very bitter finish. maybe not very complex but good.
3983,Double IPA,3.62,presentation: 12 oz. can served in a samuel adams pint glass.  appearance: one finger head that sticks around for a while and leaves some good lacing. cloudy dark gold color.  smell: dank musky hop aroma some fresh citrus peel with faint malt and grain notes in the background.  taste: bitter but not overwhelmingly so. it has more of a juicy fruity sweet citrus character which is nice. a faint piney aftertaste remains.  mouthfeel: smooth and medium bodied with medium high carbonation.  overall: nothing new or groundbreaking here which is fine. a solid dipa and a damn good beer.
3984,Double IPA,4.45,there’s a simultaneous malt & fruity kick on each sip. the piney aftertaste is blatant and incredible. yummy beer!
3985,Double IPA,4.25,l: hazy orange with a rocky white head. medium-plus retention. a thin film hangs out forever. rings of lacing are left behind.  s: huge yellow grapefruit and tangerine aromas; spraying oils juicy flesh and bitter pith. some ripe mango and pineapple honey and caramel and massive pine sap and dankness.  t: orange creamsicle yellow grapefruit peel honey toasted white bread overripe mango pine resin finish. moderately sweet although the finish grows crisp. moderate lingering bitterness.  f: medium-plus well-carbonated smooth creamy and well-rounded. finishes slightly sticky and resinous but fairly clean for the style.  o: a superb example of west coast double ipa. a delicious hoppy offering.
3986,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.9,#171 fantastic!
3987,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.24,2020 vintage. a very solid and canonical example of the style perhaps *the* prototype of what a bourbon barrel aged ris should emulate. i find the style to be a little bit on the roasty herbaceous side and this was no exception. the barrel aging did smooth things out quite a bit in the flavors although i was surprised that the mouthfeel wasnt fuller. overall very glad to finally try this but i definitely prefer beyond good and evil and their other sweeter bba stouts  85/100
3988,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.56,bottled 1/10/2020 consumed 10/28/2022  i just got a job offer today so i needed to pull something out of my cellar to celebrate. i traded a bottle of eh taylor small batch for this bottle of beer so lets see if it lives up the hype and $50 i paid for the bourbon. it does look spot on amazing. its super thick but not syrupy in a bad way. this is the kind of stout that beginners would hate and neck bearded beer nerds crave. on the tongue its super full and soft. absolutely perfect for the style for me. im not getting enough on the nose though to wow me. i get bourbon and chocolate. i smell the typical lovely bitterness of a ris. still its lacking in the nose for me. drinking it though everything lives up to the hype. its less sweet than a typical goose bcs which set the standard for me back in the day. i can taste the booziness but in a good way. i like high abv stouts where i can taste the alcohol a bit. why make a bourbon barrel aged stout if the bourbon isnt front and center? whats different and great is that theres also the balance of the base beer. theres a lot of plain old ris here. take your best like a darkness or expedition and add the bourbon with everything balancing out perfectly. the finish is long and toasty like a good cup of coffee. a great beer and worth the bourbon (at retail.)
3989,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.87,hands down the best beer i’ve ever had!
3990,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.6,pours a deep black with a thin mocha-colored head that dissipates quickly. the aroma gives notes of charred oak bourbon dark fruits dark roast coffee and vanilla. the flavor is less sharp and more rich with notes of dark chocolate espresso chocolate chip cookie and oaky bourbon and vanilla. the flavor lingers well after the sip with rich chocolatey cookie flavors. the body is very full and creamy without ever being syrupy leading to a very balanced finish. overall a very flavorful and drinkable beer. one of my favorite bba stouts i have ever had very well balanced flavor and mouthfeel. highly recommended.
3991,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.7,uh nearly perfect
3992,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.67,2021 release - jet black with considerable tan head on an aggressive pour. smell of bourbon barrel and light char. taste is incredibly balanced between barrel and chocolate no burn. thicker than i expected on the mouthfeel. classic hill world class ba non adjunct stout
3993,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.26,bottled on 1/10/2020; consumed on 1/29/2022  pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large creamy collar and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass.  aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close.  taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish.  mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish.  an honest old-school display of classic russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings this is another example of hill farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure.
3994,San Mig Light,2.74,bottle pour into a tulip glass. clear golden appearance with a foamy white head that recedes quickly to a collar and lasting surface film and no lacing. musty laundry nose. grain scallion metal taste. light body and carbonation.
3995,San Mig Light,2.68,poured into a 30oz thermo-beaker  readily brings up a whitish head that soon dissipates  dry and light  drink when ice cold + ice a twist of lemon to give it some flavour very refreshing  certainly an acquired taste but perfect for tropical countries  benefits from low carbs for the figure-conscious  not for connoisseurs
3996,San Mig Light,2.55,this one pours a very light yellow color with a small head and a little bit of lacing.  this smells like essentially nothing.  the only redeeming quality of this beer is that when it is very cold it is refreshing. there\s essentially no flavor to it - just crisp coldness. there\s a little bit of grain sweetness and it finishes surprisingly dry.  this is very light bodied watery fairly crisp and decently drinkable.  i would only drink this beer at ice-cold temperatures. thats the only way it would be enjoyable.
3997,San Mig Light,1.5,330 ml can brewed under licence by pt delta indonesia. abv is 4.9%. clear pale yellow colour low white head. sweetish industrial aroma notes of artificial candy. thin and fizzy mouthfeel. nearly void of flavour quite dry only a touch of sweetness in the background. one to forget.
3998,San Mig Light,2.74,a bit harsh for a light beer but the bite is not to harsh to enjoy. it works well on a hot day but not when trying to analyze the flavors. aftertaste is a bit metallic.
3999,San Mig Light,1.16,reminds me of soda water without as much flavor. lacks character or taste. this is a meet market brew aimed at those looking for a hook up at the local watering hole. kind of a white zinfandel of beers.
4000,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.24,look: it pours amber on the dark side with an off white head. head retention is low.  smell: it has deep caramel aromas with citrus. there are some orange notes with some nuts and a very low level of molasses.  taste: it has caramel favors with citrus and orange. there are some nutty notes with pine and floral as well.  feel: it has a full chewy body with strong alochol warming edging on the hot side.  overall complex flavors with strong alcohol is nice for one beer.
4001,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.98,this was a fantastic surprise. i expected good things and was impressed beyond expectations. dogfish head has captured the essence of utopias in a highly drinkable ipa.
4002,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.28,12oz bottle poured into a tulip  a- pours a hazy amber with a ruby hue one-finger foamy white head reduces to a ring  s- the barrel dominates the aroma with plenty of utopias notes popping through; sherry and cognac-like notes with aromas of cherry red grape toffee & caramel. faded hop aromas of candied orange and some floral notes. a bit of booze to close it out  t- rich and malty up front with bold notes of caramel and toffee immediately complimented by the barrel adding notes of cognac sherry and wet oak. mid-palate gives a hint of tang that cuts through the sweetness before giving way to the base beer which gives faded hop notes of citrus peel and red berries. the finish is boozy with the barrel notes really coming through lingers of caramel booze oak and red berries  m- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a warming boozy finish  o- huge barrel notes throughout on this one. i love utopias so i enjoyed it but the base beer of a boozy ipa probably isnt the best choice
4003,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.43,12 oz  pours cloudy amber like unfiltered apple cider. no head.  aroma is of apple biscuit honey maybe some molasses. well into barleywine territory.  flavor is very rich. caramel molasses honey pecan biscuit fig eventually giving way to oak and malted barley. there is a notable hop finish but it is no match for the richness of the sweeter flavors.  full viscous body with a stinging carbonation on the tongue accentuated by a booze bite that warms going down.  this is just a really good barleywine at this point. were so far beyond ipa that its kind of comical they still market it as such. the overwhelming richness of the malt bill is the centerpiece of this beer. the hops are barely noticeable in the flavor only approaching prominence in the aftertaste; theyre undetectable in the aroma. im not complaining its a really good beer. im just amused. unfortunately i have never had the pleasure of trying utopias so i cant comment on what if any notes here are contributed from that barrel aging but it is obviously different from the standard 120. mostly its just more than the standard 120. definitely an experience.
4004,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.09,l: a bit cloudy dark amber color. s: really boozy upfront. only a little bit of hops. t: really different. i like how well balanced this beer is but this is definitely a big beer with really intense flavors. this is not for amateurs. f: its a well balanced beer but strong feel at the same time. o: overall i like this beer but would probably like the 90 minute and 60 minute ipa better. very strong and not for the faint hearted yet the key is that this beer is balanced flavor-wise.
4005,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.26,from a bottle. dark amber color with a few bubbles when pouring. brown sugar and raisin aroma. full bodied with moderate carbonation. maple syrup and raisin with an earthy hop finish. definitely unique almost a port/sherry crossed with an ipa.
4006,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.15,growler into pint glass. pours a gorgeous clear amber with a brief white head. no lacing. initial impression is sweet maple syrup candied orange grapefruit rind and caramel. mouthfeel is nice and sticky. finish fades to a sweet citrus. overall a bit sweet for my tastes but at 17% you tend to forgive such minor transgressions.
4007,120 Minute IPA - Utopias Barrel-Aged,4.46,poured at fridge temp. pours a nice amber color with lots of little bubbles rising throughout. not much head. the nose is candied oranges maple toffee and citrusy hops. the taste is pretty insane. wow. i am fighting for the right words here. not really feeling like an ipa. definitely leaning more barleywine. the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate. first comes a slightly bitter hoppy sensation which is followed a pillow of sweet caramel. grapefruit peel is subtle. candy plums and malty greatness. this is truly unique and im in need of another bottle! the abv is not detectable. certainly doesnt drink at 17% abv.
4008,Blåbær Lambik,4.35,pours crystal clear dark ruby with almost purple hues. 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever. an essentially perfect appearing beer. aroma has a huge minerality only mild lactic tartness subtle pungent funk not much fruit. taste is burnt plastic like funk some bitterness moderate tart sourness blueberries are subtle. i poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer a blueberry cobbler character almost. the taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. ok back to the main pour. as it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. fruit comes out a bit and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most cantillons. it’s very clean crispy even with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. overall a very nice beer. is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it? the short answer is probably no but hell it was fun anyways.  5/4.25/4.25/4.75/4.25
4009,Blåbær Lambik,4,bottle rbesg 2007 in glasgow grand tasting. hazy deep red colour. distinct aroma of blueberries and ripe raspberries also some woody notes. very sour flavour lemon and blueberry notes. quite good.
4010,The Devil Made Me Do It!,3.62,a very solid porter with a great aroma flavor and feel. does just about everything correctly but might be too heavy even for a porter.
4011,The Devil Made Me Do It!,3.8,a bottle from 2016.  pours out dark brown with some highlights and forms three fingers worth of light caramel colored crown that stick around well. looks like the carbonation held up well.  the nose is brown oats some chocolate and coffee. there is a nice balanced roastiness that mixes well with that chocolate.  nice chocolate in the taste. an all around balanced porter. nothing is too overpowering and everything is working well together.  it still has carbonation holding on which is nice. not too thin not too thick.  overall an enjoyable drink.
4012,The Devil Made Me Do It!,4.48,lucky enough to have it straight from the tap at tyrannena at the beer run post race party. tasty potent and tremendously robust! do you like coffee? do you like beer? look no further.
4013,The Devil Made Me Do It!,3.5,bottled 11/18/15; drank 2/28/16 @ the yarchives.  black/brown appearance.  a rough pour yielded a small tan head; decent lace.  dark chocolate black coffee mild smoke & faint cream notes in the nose.  medium mouthfeel.  cream & chocolate syrup flavors up front; faint raspberry notes on the finish.  the nose promised a lot but the flavor was muted. disappointing but not bad.
4014,The Devil Made Me Do It!,3.36,tastes like cloying sweet old soggy coffee grounds steeped in a porter.
4015,The Devil Made Me Do It!,4,aroma is chocolate dark malts and slightly grainy/earthy. the flavor is dark malts mild citrus/fruit chocolate slight sugar sweetness and a smooth/acidic finish.
4016,The Devil Made Me Do It!,4.03,solid coffee beer. very smooth.
4017,Red Dog,5,dont understand why score so low. loved this beer when i could find it here in the south.
4018,Red Dog,2.32,wasnt aware this was still in production certainly havent seen it in nh in decades. we would occasionally dip into these for a change from the other equally swill beers of the day rarely ever able to afford budweiser.
4019,Red Dog,1.5,12oz can. can’t say no to free beer (but maybe you should sometimes). my father-in-law bought this because it had a dog on the label. that might have been the best feature
4020,Red Dog,3.9,(12 oz can apr 2020; bought cold single at local basic liquors... poured into a 14 oz mug)  l: inch-high foam on pour sitting atop a polished-clear brass-colored liquid; the foam is actually relatively dense and glossy receding surprisingly slow... holds a half-moon crescent collar and dang if there isnt 3-4 thick bands of lace - huh?  s: very pale almost flour-like vaguely corn-flaky grain smell dominates mellow toasted note; mildly grassy-herbal overtone  t: apple juicy ester(?) up front with a sudden surge of cereal-like (again corn flakes) dried grassy/earthy grain midway; finishes rather dry with a mild lingering pils malt husk note maybe a slight background tinge of masa; moderately bitter for its ilk  f: certainly a vibrant effervescence bubbling and rumbling the center of each sip with a few healthy belches as proof... the body itself is on the meatier side of light  o: first time having this in perhaps 25 years last time being likely a lukewarm can awash in a sea of melting ice in a cooler at a gathering in the woods (or one of my other many haunts)... had no recollection of this being a miller product but given my inclination toward their brands i could honestly see getting this again even just maybe a 30 pack (ive seen em) (1722)
4021,Red Dog,3.08,pours a translucent gold like any other aal with a white head that dissipates immediately. smells like wet grain with a touch of just enough hops to let you know its not a light beer. taste is surprisingly better than most with a less apparent adjunct presence than other macros. this one shines because it doesnt lie. its uncommonly smooth. this goes down maybe even easier than water. overall an exceptional aal but ive only seen it once. get it if you can.
4022,Red Dog,1.85,overall shit
4023,Red Dog,2.46,our dog came back. we rescued him. we thought he was gone but we got him back. its the beer that your dad crushed at dive bars and boson garden. its the classic 90’s beer and we got it back. red dog. is it good? no not particularly. easy drinking honestly probably one of the better miler products. again not really sure what that says. but this beer was bought for the story. the brand.
4024,Red Dog,4.94,red dog is a great budget beer. goes down smooth and taste pretty darn good. great poker beer!
4025,Red Dog,3.69,great cheap beer
4026,Red Dog,5,red dog is the shit. 30 pack from roger wilco in pennsauken was about $21.00. looks great smells amazing tastes even better and then it feels so good. red dawg. признайся!
4027,Red Dog,2,better than a lot of ice beers. that is not saying much this is still awful in almost every way shape and form. the only thing that separates this is that it actually tastes somewhat like beer.
4028,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.15,pretty decent beer.
4029,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.75,12oz stubby bottle - review from notes  i had a friend give me this one thanks janoy!! this is better than any other michelob ive had which isnt saying much but this is decent. like a very watered down brown ale or a slightly watered down amber  its aight
4030,Michelob Ultra Amber,5,best tasting beer ive ever drank in my 40 years of being of legal drinking age!
4031,Michelob Ultra Amber,1.87,pours a slightly darker yellow than the original michelob i wouldnt call it amber. has a thin white head that leaves the glass quickly. smells like the inside of a glass bottle with just the faintest amount of grains on the tail-end. taste follows the nose. the only reason im giving this beer a 2 on taste is because you know what youre getting into when you buy ultra youre looking for a lower calorie brew ultras provide you with one. light-bodied high carbonation smooth extremely crushable...
4032,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.85,rates just a touch above halfway between below average and average. for a low calorie brew its drinkable. light brown color with small head. light smell of malt which transfers to the taste which is a bit watered down. light mouthfeel and light malty aftertaste
4033,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.25,nothing wrong with this. compared with other light beers it’s fine.
4034,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.61,look: dull brown no character it is clear though. smell: mineral water? taste: mineral water very little of anything. not sure what the point of making an amber version that tastes the same as the regular ultra. comical. overall: skip it just get the regular ultra if that’s what gets you off this is just a gimmick.
4035,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.82,first. i see this beer was added back in 2006. why have i never seen or heard of ultra amber until 2019? so this beer is a watery brown ale basically. its taste is pleasant and nothing offputting at all. easy to drink. i have no problems with this beer at all.
4036,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.09,h82
4037,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.28,better tasting than regular michelob ultra or some of the other shitty flavors it comes in. better than pure gold. very watered down amber beer. about the same mouthfeel as yuengling light. 95 calories is impressive. definitely can slam back some of these. there better than some but worse than more. if that makes any sense.
4038,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.78,12 ounce bottle into lager glass bottled on 1/26/2016. pours crystal clear deep golden amber light orange color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. aromas of cracker white bread dough and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of honey caramel roast wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. minimal fruity notes in the aromas. nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of pale/roast malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. taste of cracker white bread dough and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of honey caramel roast wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. light herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of cracker white bread dough toasted biscuit honey caramel roast wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. nice robustness complexity and balance of pale/roast malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. moderately crisp/clean finishing. perfectly clean on lager flavors with no fruity/yeasty notes present. light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%. overall this is a very good amber light lager. all around nice robustness complexity and balance of pale/roast malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. very flavorful and not watery for the abv. very clean pale/roast malt showcase with nice earthy hop presence/balance for the style. mild residual sweetness with crisp dryness. a very enjoyable offering and outstanding style example. one of the best light lagers i have had.
4039,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.8,3.2 carbs. 95 cals. 4% abv. 12 fl oz. $6.99 usd per sixer.  i bought this because i was pleasantly surprised by michelob lager but this compares unfavorably to that superior lager. this has some toasty amber malt notes but theyre buried leaving only an insipid one-two punch of 2-row barley and muted noble hop grassiness to satiate.  shallow and simple but certainly drinkable. not a beer id want to revisit another sixer of but theres no doubting itd pair fine with pizza or spicy wings.  low c (2.80) / average
4040,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.88,i like this. solid light and easy drinking beer.
4041,Keystone Ice,1.44,pounder can from the clearance aisle. actually looks pretty good. but looks can be deceiving. and they are. nasty musty pasty aroma wet paper smell. taste does not improve things corny overly sweet flavors. every time i go back for another sip it loses points. the beautiful foamy head is the lone saving grace and that disappears pretty quickly. hobo piss indeed. and i thought nigeria pal was bad....
4042,Keystone Ice,2,this is what one buys as a college student looking for a cheap buzz.
4043,Keystone Ice,1.3,one of the worst beers ive had.
4044,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.33,bottled 10/5/21  this is cantillon’s most popular beer and i’m somehow only getting to it now. i was originally intending to just buy another bottle of fou foune from mbc but when i saw the seller had this one available for a good price i figured i had to get it. let’s pop it open and see what it has to offer  pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  theres a lot of funk in the nose here but its very well integrated. im picking up on aromas of wet hay sharp oak lemon zest wildflower honey crabapple white wine vinegar white pepper light cracker and pear  the funk is certainly more aggressive in taste though its more than welcome here. on the front end of the sip im tasting lemon juice earthy wheat sharp oak white wine vinegar crabapple pear skin wet hay jammy apricot and white pepper. the swallow brings notes of lemon juice wildflower honey crabapple sharp oak white wine vinegar pear skin jammy apricot earthy wheat tobacco light cracker and a touch of smoke  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a sharp yet slick beer. finishes oddly sticky but eventually dries out  this is wonderful but im honestly a bit surprised that its not super dry. the sticky finish takes away from the experience a bit but overall its still a great expereince
4045,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.5,750 ml bottle split with my wife poured into red wine glasses. 2019 vintage. this is a wonderfully complex gueuze. green apple plentiful but not overwhelming acidity leather funk oak tannins and a hint of vinegar are the primary flavor notes. mouthfeel has average carbonation and a dry finish. stellar.
4046,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.34,750ml bottle poured into tulip. date on bottle says december of 21.  pours a deep golden orange with half a finger of dirty white head that leaves clouds of lace as it recedes.  smells of white wine vinegar sour green apples zesty oranges juicy stone fruit barrel wood and some lacto funk.  tastes more fruit-forward. apricot pineapple sour apple navel orange more sharp vinegar barnyard funk and barrel staves.  feels smooth and delicate. light bodied with soft carbonation. finishes sour and fruity.  verdict: vigorously recommended. world class for sure.
4047,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.5,got one from taiwan and one from la village de la biere in strasbourg. great example of the style.
4048,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.49,2500th review! its only been 9.5 years. super excited to try this legendary cantillon as ive been sitting on it for a few months hoping for a milestone brew. 2021 bottling and purchased from durand for a small but worthwhile fortune. my first loon. served cold into a goblet.  appearance - picturesque bright golden color with a small amount of haze. a finger of small soapy cap that continues to fizzle on as more head forms from the bubbles rising in the glass.  smell - tartness with subtle bits of cherry apple skins woody and slightly musty barrel some earthy funk. theres sort of a deep underlying sweetness there too that ties all the aromas together.  taste - a little sourness and green apple tartness. elements of wood and musty barrel. light grapey qualities too. funky without being too far out in left field. cohesive in the flavors. a slightly spicy element in the aftermath maybe. as it warms the woody barrel note seems to be elevated with a trace of honey. depth of flavor is awesome and lingers on really well in the aftertaste  mouthfeel - medium-light body good expressive carbonation and very dry finish.  overall - awesome sour beer the depth is unreal and its difficult to decipher everything youre tasting. super stoked to have finally tried this and boy does it ever live up to expectations. one of my best new beers of 2022 and a very worthy milestone brew. absolutely worth trying if you can a) find it and b) afford it.
4049,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.49,september 2021 bottle.  looks: slightly cloudy orange/gold no head or legs.  smells: sour and funky lots of fruit for an unfruited lambic (bacteria are amazing hey?). i get apricot orange zest citron green apple pineapple wood a bit of bread and apple cider vinegar levels of fermentation.  tastes: similar to the nose but less fruity mostly apricot citrus and green apple plus the woodiness and bready malt with the sourness and funk being more prominent. gave me a big initial pucker but was smooth after.  feels: nice medium body a slight fuzzy carbonation that doesnt linger very long.  overall: heck yeah. awesome gueuze lives up to the cantillon hype even if its not mind-blowing.
4050,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.34,a 750ml corked and capped bottle 20/21 season bottled on 1st october 2020. poured into a 3 fonteinen gueuze glass.  appearance: a mostly clear golden orange colour with a big two finger white head that had pretty good retention and eventually settled to a thin cap while leaving some nice lacing.  aroma: sour tart funky musty wet wood green apple grapefruit zest with a touch of white grapes.  taste: sour tart slightly sweet funky oak apricot with some light lemon zesty notes.  mouthfeel: light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  overall: a nice enjoyable easy to drink gueuze. perfect for a hot summer day.
4051,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.42,smell of tart cherries and some yeasty bread. orange-ish pour with visible active carbonation. flavor is tart but nothing like the kettle sours of today. more balanced and smooth enough to allow for the fruit notes to come through. this is surprisingly mellow in the finish with the bready notes of the yeast taking hold.  my first cantillon offering and shared with a couple friends at monks cafe in philly. absolutely a must try for any beer enthusiast.
4052,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.19,bottle pour- opaque dark golden color with quickly dissipating white head. nose is a bit funky with hints of tart fruit and yeast.. taste follows with a a tart and tangy crispness. an interesting brew that i liked more than expected.
4053,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.41,rich gold body is almost copper clear and shining forming a fine fizzy head off white and holding retention for a little over a minute before dwindling to a thin layer. aroma is lightly tart and fruity like white grapes wheat honey. fresh bright and light - feels like summer in an orchard; reminiscent of spanish sidre with flavours of crisp sweet/tart apples and hay with a whisper of funk a light lactic tang the freshest mountain water oak; its the perfect level of sourness enough to make you smack your lips but not pucker; the finish is dry and flavour lingers; the feel is prickly and finely effervescent medium bodied crisp yet silky.  beautiful in its simplicity and refinement. not particularly complex it is pure and deftly crafted and approachable.
4054,Gueuze 100% Lambic,1.11,cantillon brewery brussels  looked tasted felt like vomit resulted from alcohol poisoning.  horrendous.  gex.
4055,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.27,bottle received from @snaotheus in bif14 shenagians poured into a teku from that same schnickelfritz  creamy white one finger foam layer over a translucent golden liquid with active carbonation streams  settles to a solid layer with spotty lacings  aroma is tart yeasty  cidery  taste is tart  maybe apple maybe pear definitely tart and sour  lip puckering thirst quenching tart yet a smooth crisp mouthfeel  good beer  world class. thank you for your generosity in getting me this beer tick  wicked awesome wicked pissah!!!
4056,The Wild One,4.04,dark brown in color with a fingernail of beige around the rim and covering half of the top. the aroma is of horse blanket barnyard funk and dark cherries. i’m tasting dark cherries horse blanket and barnyard funk. the mouth is dry and crisp.
4057,The Wild One,4.14,pours a light brownish red with small tan bubbles that dissipate to fast to be really called a head.  aroma is light sweet from the grain venous notes from the barrel light tart fruits grapes cherries dryness from the oak hints of brett.  taste follows the nose light brown malt notes hints of sweetness soon dominated by the venous barrel notes plus the oak and light brett tartness. normally would have trouble finishing a 750 of a tart sour but this one blends all aspects together so its pretty damn drinkable .  mouthfeel is light with medium full carbonation without being too much if that makes sense.  overall a pretty damn good brew.
4058,The Wild One,4.24,clear deep amber/copper color with a minimal tan head. toasted grain and dark fruity aroma of grapes and cherries. tart cherry oak tannin slight cider vinegar acidity. medium bodied goes down easy.
4059,The Wild One,4,i understand la folie might have inspired this beer possibly but this one is much better to me. taste is about the same but theres more fervor to this one. the main plus is this is full bodied where as la folie felt kind of...watery to me. solid brew
4060,The Wild One,4.09,bottle from johnnyhops. roughly a year old. reminds me of an oude bruin.
4061,The Wild One,3.98,medium reddish brown clean pour save a thin cream ring. vinous barrel bring out notes of cherry currant flowers light brett and rustic grain. earth wine dark oak a whisper of cherry skin hints of lemon and pear decent underripe cranberry and dried prune sour brown malts round out. feel is lighter bodied with a tart and vinous light finish doesnt build so the end is kind of bland where you want culmination. good for a rainy day
4062,The Wild One,4,sour brown ale made with wild yeast aged up to 8 months in oak foeders; 6.3% abv... ruddy brown and fairly clear under a finger of tan foam... tangy apple and tannic oak moderately sweet very little bitterness; smooth and amply carbonated; something like sweet grapefruit flesh in there too... 1/15/21 bottling...
4063,The Wild One,4,unknown vintage; drank 6/25/16 on draft @ sheffields.  opaque purple appearance.  no head; no lace.  sour dark grape & soft grain notes in the nose.  medium thin mouthfeel.  dark grape & tart cherry flavors.  easy to drink fruity & great for summer. the mild tartness adds a hint of complexity but this was more fruit beer than sour.
4064,The Wild One,3.68,a beer i have missed on many occasions for 5+ years. now on tap at my local beer bar. how times have changed. on tap at das beer garden. deep orange with a big white head. smells of toasted malt dark fruit and a bit of vinegar acidity. tastes of slight vinegar throughout. never too much but always present. green apple too. toasted malt. a little bit of a red wine character. moderately sour. well carbonated and pretty crisp for what it is. medium body. very good.
4065,The Wild One,4.15,on tap at novare
4066,Supplication,4.53,august ‘23. a fresh bottle. l: ruby reddish orange thin head. s: rich cherry vanilla strawberry hints of spices and oak alcohol. t: tart joyful fruity spices. tart cherry and apple upfront backed with cinnamon. spices through the body mainly cinnamon. faint malty caramel. more sweetness in the body. hints of berry. notes of oak mineral and funk on the finish. f: tart faintly prickly dry finish. o: late summer in a bottle. fall and the harvest are faintly on the air. that’s what this is. the spice the fruit what a beer.
4067,Supplication,4.49,supplication (2023) from russian river. 12.68 fl oz cork and cage bottle from @2beerdogs in nbs bif #17. reviewed 23/06/23 (review 3127). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. label stamped “bottled on 020823”. stored at 34 degrees at home. served at 49.8 degrees f in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 55.9 degrees f. appearance – 4.25 first pour – gold (srm 5) clear. body – deep gold (srm 6) chill haze. under direct light opaque. when rear lite chill haze. head: average (maximum 3.5 cm aggressive center pour) champagne high density quickly diminishing to a 0.5 mm broken ring of bubbles with no cap. lacing – none. aroma – 4.5 – weak cherries and oak. no yeast no hops. no ethanol (7.75 % abv according to the label). flavor – 4.5 – cherry slightly sour with some tannin. no yeast no hops. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. no ethanol flavor but pleasant gastric warming. palate – 4.5 – medium; watery; lively but soft carbonation. final impression and summation: 4.5 another excellent brew from rr. their combo of pediococcus lactobacillus brettanomyces and saccharomyces species yields a great tasting mixture of organic acids and other metabolic end products although as the temperature rises the tannin begins to dominate. still quite good!
4068,Supplication,3.73,375ml cork-topped bottle bottled on 020823 (barrel aged 9 to 15 months pinor noir barrels with cherries). served in my new stemless cbc glass. brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation. mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness. flavor brings on a lot of that tartness approaching outright sour but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the brett nicely. sharp carbonation is suitable here.  if i was more into sours i might find this outstanding. i find it more drinkable than cerise cassée and i really appreciate the balance here. unfortunately for me its a balance between sour brett and sweet cherries not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that id be more interested in.
4069,Supplication,4.44,this pours out copper a bit of haze minimal head and no lacing. nose is a punchy vinegar note wine barrel and fruit beneath. flavor is a less aggressive presentation of the nose with cherry and full red wine elements melding into the strong acidity. the wildness also comes through as a counter to the acidity putting some earthiness and funk on the back end. well built and delicious.
4070,Supplication,2.11,i couldnt get into this one. the taste was all over the place and a bit too sour for my tastes. carbonation and head was good. sad because i really wanted to like this.
4071,Supplication,2.4,bottled in 2014 poured into a tulip glass. this beer has way too much going on. almost like they tried to creat so many flavor profiles it ended up just tasting like a mess. not very drinkable thus not very enjoyable.
4072,Supplication,4.21,bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. fairly clear amber color coming out of the bottle settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. the aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way.  taste is wonderfully........different. this is unlike any beer i can recall in recent memory. the cherries are remarkably present after 5 years but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is whats really making this one interesting. plenty of sweet malts up front but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated.  overall very interesting and very good beer.
4073,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.94,12oz bottle poured into a teku glass. looks copper colored in the body with an off white head that sticks around a bit. not a perfectly clear beer but looks still in the glass as far as carbonation. smell is brown bread grain slight citrus from the hops. taste is pretty well balanced. you get the dark bread pepper spiciness from the malt coupled nicely with the grapefruit lemon pine from the hops. these flavors seem to be well balanced with none really dominating. feel is medium bodied with low level carbonation. beer seems to linger a bit on the tongue. overall i remember this beer very differently from before. this is a very pleasant drink as it is substantial balanced and very good. a bit different obviously due to the rye. i enjoyed it.
4074,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.71,it’s worth shelling out for the fan favorites dozen to get three bottles of this gem. easily the best rye ipa i’ve come across. please bring this back as a year round staple
4075,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.85,poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 4/13/23 into a willi becher pint glass. l - pours a clear dark amber color with a white head. s - smells malty. t - tastes citrusy malty and bitter. f - medium body and carbonation. o - kind of a malty hoppy ipa.
4076,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.68,ruthless rye ipa  sierra nevada brewing co.  ipa-rye  a malty brown sugar and earthy rye aroma. malt hefty with a nice earthy rye dryness and burnt caramel style sweetness in the finish. smooth mostly with a slightly dry feel. rye is a favorite adjunct within a classic malt heavy american ipa style.
4077,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.58,phenomenal beer. im sure the only reason i love it so much is because the rye flavor is rare. strange black-pepper musk in smell and flavor overall a hyper-exaggerated wheat ale. if you took the wheat flavor of a red/brown-colored/rich ale and gave it steroids youd get this beer. (sidenote: im seeing if this posts forgot to click submit and woke up next day to do so and said error no sign in even though i was.)
4078,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.24,from a 12oz bottle dated 4/13/23 into a pint glass.  pours a translucent copper color with about a finger and a half of slightly off-white head.  smells of spicy pine and a bit of earth and freshly cut grass.  nice spicy (rye) kick to the piney bitterness in the taste.  medium to full-bodied sticky mouthfeel. bitter aftertaste. medium carbonation.  havent had a ton of rye ipas but this one is pleasant enough.
4079,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.83,poured from 12-ounce bottle into a tulip style glass. this is one beautiful pour: clear amber color with orange highlights and a thick white head. good retention lots of pretty curtain lacing. brewers notes are spot-on. citrusy and herbal aromas with a floral overtone. these carry over to the palate with a strong caramel malt backbone and a spicy note and lots of bitterness lingering on the finish. much better drinking after it warms from fridge temperature for a few minutes. overall an excellent beer.
4080,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.63,pours copper like brown great clarity slight off-white head builds quickly and sustains for quite some time; collapses into a fat cohesive head that leaves some substantial lacing.  the nose is so vibrant and lively; spicy wood cedar like zesty character sappy orange citrus some vague and light floral character.  taste is very rye forward and carries some toasted grain character rustic tasting in nature caramelized maltiness pine needles and orange citrus rind; black pepper bite on the finish.  medium light body classic smooth creamy sn carbonation the perfect kiss of malt sweetness that is then crushed by a spicy biting bitterness which then flips to absolutely dry clean finish.
4081,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,1.68,disgusting. shameful. this is real crappy beer. new belgium has made terrible changes to their beers...once i drain the 24 pack purchased @ costco i will steer clear of new belgium beer...sad...i used to appreciate fat tire ipa & their attempts @ belgium style beers. all we can hope for is their leadership is fired.
4082,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,3.54,poured from a can into a pint glass. pours yellow orange with a nice white head. smells of bright tropical fruit and some fruit punch notes smells processed. tastes of tropical fruit but an artificial sense. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall an above average beer.
4083,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,4,i am transported back to 1969 with the memory of stirring a glass of hawaiian fruit punch from concentrate. the fruit taste lasts through out with an underlying taste of voodoo. would be good for the ladies that dont like the ipa taste and at 9.5 abv would be a cheap date!
4084,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,4.51,my favorite ipa out right now downing a sixer of these on any off day i can find deliciously juicy and quite hazy lacking the super bitter hops but maintaining enough body to make sure you know what youre drinking. nearly perfect beer
4085,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,1.34,this is possibly the worst beer i have ever tried.  i have been a beer lover my whole life.  i have been drinking beer for over 40 years. i never drank “american” beers even when i started as a teenager in the 1980s. i worked my way through every funky high alcohol import i could find back then and loved them all. pilsners porters ales ipas clear cloudy thick thin you name it. every variation i could find.  as an adult i have tried beers all i over asia and europe. i can find something to like about almost every beer i have ever tried…until a ran into fruit force…  this is a perfect example of “just because you can doesn’t mean you should”.  it tastes like hawaiian punch poured into a mediocre ipa with a half shot of vodka thrown in for good measure.  unrefined unnatural and horrible.  why?  a horrible beer by a decent brewery. and i am an alum of colorado state in ft. collin’s!  do yourself a favor and stay away.
4086,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,1.33,made it through about 2/3 of a can before realizing this was one of the worst beers ive had. not worth finishing. 2/3 and done.
4087,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,5,this ipa is amazing. i dont understand all the hate. it tastes great and gets the job done. highly recommend. great on a hot summer day. my new go too beer this summer
4088,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,3.88,im a big belgium beer fan and have tried many including the ones in the states that try to duplicate. honestly i find omegang my preferred not because i live in upstate ny and support local businesses but because they did a fantastic job of duplicating and improving. probably why large belgium brewery purchased them.  but back to the whole point of this; new belgiums new trip into voo doo ranger brand growth.  i drink all of them especially the imperial ipa which is my preferred but in the scorching texas heat it is nice to have a strong ipa with hints of fruit and citrus that tastes light but gives you a bang for the buck.  now there a many other belgium golden ales that blow this juice for ipa out of the park but for the price its not bad if you are just chilling in the heat and want some refreshing beer.  note i drank the juicy force before the fruit force and think the juicy is much better.
4089,Voodoo Ranger Fruit Force,1.32,what the what??? seriously i just grabbed this at the store because you know new belgium normally knocks it out of the park. i didn\t even see the fruit punch ipa text at the bottom of the label... i just thought oh a new belgium i haven\t tried. talk about a disappointment! i literally signed up for beer advocate just so i could complain about this disaster.  my wife actually asked me if i just ate a fruit gummy candy right after i opened the can (i hadnt even taken a sip). im beyond amazed that new belgium even let this crap out at all... unless theyre trying to target elementary students (creepy but that is how it tastes). never again.
4090,Double Nelson,4.37,look - slight haze orangish yellow with slight white head nice rimming smell and taste - crisp grainy earthy citrus with a slight tropical complex and a lot there feel - light crispness overall - pretty nice
4091,Double Nelson,4.7,this beer is distinctive in its hop character and taste. bittersweet almost earthy but extremely drinkable. it has a quality that most beers dont have a sense of place. a truly unique beer and that is what makes it exceptional.
4092,Double Nelson,4.54,a - pours a hazy golden orange with a large fluffy white head. heavy amount of soapy lacing.  s - aroma is mango tangerine white grapes and floral hops.  t - the taste is tangerine mango apricot white grape honey and finishing with a grassy bitter hop bite  m - medium body with medium carbonation. creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish.  o - top notch neipa.
4093,Double Nelson,4.5,sweet tropical hoppy slightly malty white wine grape and a hint of nelson-dank nose on this one! taste follows with a malty-sweet nelson hoppy bitter finish. east coast vibes on this all-nelson dipa. the maltiness is present but you still get some pretty good nelson hop expression. additionally this feels nice and soft on the palate...fantastic!
4094,Double Nelson,4.9,#162 great stuff!
4095,IPA,4.7,this has been a go-to for many years. once it was on the hairy edge of too hoppy. now it seems to be middle-of-the-road that way. bottles are better than cans.
4096,IPA,4.36,doesn’t look or smell great but makes up for it in taste.
4097,IPA,4,classic ipa at a great value. what more is there to say?
4098,IPA,4.14,a really solid american ipa always a reliable choice.
4099,IPA,4.09,pours a crystal clear vibrant golden amber from the can (two months old) huge fluffy 3 head excellent retention and lacing. hard to find any faults in terms of looks. nose is orange grapefruit and lemon peel; pine and resin; green pepper and some slight astringency. nose isn\t as rich and expressive as say stone ipa but it still hits the classic west coast notes (plus a little spice). taste follows the nose - citrus sweetness (orange grapefruit) and mild malt and bitterness. juicy candied orange and grapefruit peels dominate. finish is a little rough around the edges (green pepper). overall like the nose it\s most reminiscent of a dialed-down stone. mouthfeel is moderate with a touch of softness. as far as mass market pounders go this is one of the best.
4100,IPA,4.23,can dated 4/12: pours a classic medium golden and clear ignoring the chill that adds condemnation to the glass on a humid day. a classic citrus pith and pine with a little more of the latter comes out even on a cold beer. at this initial lower temperature the grain cones out as lightly toasted bread crust backed by a husky to piney bitterness evolving more towards the classic hop flavor. the beer finished in a classically wcipa fashion at this point.  the beer gets a little bit of rye bread crust in the aroma as it warms but a larger amount of pine relative to the colder version. the pine also starts to take hold of the flavor profile and i’m starting to lose any citrus vibe in either attribute a quarter glass into the pour.  feel is medium leaning light (even a tad more so considering the state of ipas today). upon reaching what i would call a proper temp the aroma gains a slight floral vibe pairing with grapefruit pith more than pine. interesting how it seems to have evolved for me today. the taste also turns a bit pithy in the middle while continuing to finish a bit piney.  a nice pretty much classic ipa that seems just slightly less brash than i recall from the era when this was a new thing to me.
4101,IPA,4.06,lagunitas brewing ipa @ 6.2%  originally tasted on tap @ gcbf14  this review from a 650 ml bottle & 500 ml cans a-pour is a light gold from the tap/bottle/can to a golden amber in the glass with a small size white head leaving a fine spotty lace along the sampler/tulip/spiegelau s-piney resin  so west coast t-big tasting california ipa  decent bitter swallow mf-ok carbonation  feels full bodied ov-good beer (even at a $1.99 / can) prost lampertland
4102,IPA,2.72,april 2023. industrial (non-craft) beer produced for my european market by heineken (ned). it can be found in 35.5 cl bottles and the price fluctuates between €2.60 and €2.90 in local supermarkets (which in these parts are not a sales channel for craft beers). sometimes it is more fragrant and gives a greater sense of freshness sometimes it seems more stale. even the vivacity of carbonation is sometimes more lively than others but on average it has a sufficient fizz. not an irresistible scent on the nose in which herbaceous and malt notes are felt. deep golden color almost orange. abundant foam: soft but persistent. medium/light body. partly malty at the beginning with hints of caramel then hops take over with a fair amount of bitterness. main hints of resin citrus and herbaceous (pine needles). dry fairly bitter. sometimes there is a ferrous note. one of the least worst industrial beers the intensity (medium but perceptible even after drinking) of the final bitterness is the thing that most distinguishes it from the other industrial products available on the shelves. drinkable but soulless.
4103,Emperor Julius,4.59,l - opaque hazy golden/orange with a soft offwhite head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing s - floral/grassy piney hops along with tons of citrus and malt t - follows the nose: orange bomb up front and throughout intermixed well with piney bitter grassy hops f - full bodied light to moderate carbonation. soft fluffy smooth. o - an orange dipa bomb and a fantastic example of a neipa
4104,Emperor Julius,4.63,reviewer prior is too hilarious to ignore. i also hope i never fall prey to reverse lupulin threshold shift!!  dang well my reviews get duller and duller over the years.  this is a damn good beer by tree house. you should get it.
4105,Emperor Julius,4.66,serving: can canned: aug-2-2023 consumed: aug-15-2023  thats what im talking about! after a couple th beers that seemed noticeably different in overall profile than my memory of them i was starting to get worried that either they had majorly tweaked something my memory was failing my senses were wonky or (worst of all) that i had fallen prey to reverse lupulin threshold shift. but praise be! that doesnt seem to be the case. this bad boy is dead on.  from the look to the aroma to the taste to the palate the whole thing just pops and met my standard (unconscious audible groan/swearing) for being nigh-perfect. solid representation of the style to my tastes and noticeably a tree house character. cant do much better than that.  the nose and flavor are big characterful mixes of sweet citrus ripe mango with a dash of boozy citrus/lupuline oil aromatics. like the oil that you can see spray off a twisted rind of the light is just right. the flavor is similar and has a nice bitter but not overly bitter boozy but not too much finish to it that kind of dissolves into orange rind and makes it take all my concentration to not just plow through the glass. as it warms (and this one started out at cellar temp*) the perfumey/boozy character mentioned above melts into a creamy sweet sort of character that really ties the whole beer together and sums up that classic estery fruity soft juicy th character. simply excellent.  glad i have a couple more and many thanks minor god of drunken flannel for peer pressuring me into buying it.  4.25...4.5...4.75...4.75...4.75**   *- actually typing this out i realized this is the first of these recent tree house beers that came out of my trusty beer fridge (48.5°) and not a normal fridge temps below 40. i think there well could be something to that and my last 3-4 seeming a little lackluster. lesson to you kids out there that warmer is often better contrary to what big beer™ brainwashes us with.  **- the last drink in the glass made me unconsciously curse out loud alone on my balcony. better than the first sip bumped overall up 0.25 points.
4106,Emperor Julius,4.23,a finger and a half worth of an airy yet fluffy bone white colored froth... sid retention... color is an opaque pale orange... nose is much more muted than expected... light orange juice and subtle tropical fruits... flavor profile is completely inline with the nose... feel is medium to full bodied... rather sturdy and mostly sleek with a good bite... reaaly good and rather unique but didnt quite live up to the rather lofty expectations i had built up...
4107,Emperor Julius,3.93,pours a turbid golden with off white head great retention to be fair. freshly squeezed florida oranges straight off the tree. i find that tree house beers dont always deliver on the hoppy aromatics but this one does somewhat. i get a lot of mango kind of in that dole tropical juice deliver with some rind citrus on the finish. on subsequent sips the rind and citrus which you could call dank is more pronounced and the tropicality has all but disappeared. its sharp as @sabtos said. its kind of boring after the first sip to be honest. and it lacks the balance that regular julius has. this is fine.
4108,Emperor Julius,4.33,tried at gregg’s 6/16/23
4109,Pure Blonde,3.82,good when very hot and thirsty.
4110,Pure Blonde,2.57,when i was a fresh-faced just out of high school 18 year old i loved my pure blondes. truth be told i didnt know shit from shoe polish when it came to beer and i think i enjoyed it for its light crisp taste and its tremendous marketing at the time. the bogan truck driver going through the pristine forest where angels were bottling pure blonde out of a river only for the truck driver to grab a dove out of the area and open up a beer with the dove. its fallen by the wayside for me ever since i had my first pale ale and since then ive watched it go from 4.9% abv to 4.6% abv and now a rather pityful 4.2% abv.  cub have also played around the marketing of this beer over marketing the fact it\s low-carb and vegan and organic etc.  lets see if i still have fond memories of my 18-year old self. poured into my pint glass from a 375ml can  look. having poured this out of the can aggressively its only produced a fingers worth of frothy white head thats dissipating quickly. standard aussie lager look clear pale golden maybe slightly lighter than your more full strength options. clear filtered bog standard.  smell: grassy/citrus hop notes but definitely pride of ringwood in there as well. slightly malty slightly grainy slightly bready. not too bad.  taste: smooth mellowed malt sweetness followed by a slight bitterness. slight grain flavour but a few seconds after the sip i do pick up a chemical aftertaste.  feel: highly carbonated but easy drinking. goes down smooth. highly refreshing. would be worth a can or two to quench the thirst on a hot summer day.  overall. it gets a pass from me. maybe its old nostalgia from my adult teenage years but i cant hate it completely. its not nearly as good as i remember it from being 18 and i think the reduction in abv from 4.9 to 4.2% is playing a part on that as the flavours are quite mellow.  i dont buy into the whole low carb charade a lot of aussie beers are going with now. its probably one of the better low-carb lagers out on the market as its not overly sweet and easy drinking. im unlikely to buy this at the pub or a slab of it unless its on special
4111,Pure Blonde,2.8,a pale clear lemon yellow with a small but lasting and lacing creamy white head. aromas of grain straw lemon pith and grass carrying through onto the palate. light in body with medium to full carbonation a firm but thin mouthfeel with a short finish of lightly bitter citrus zest and grain.
4112,Pure Blonde,2.57,format: a 355ml green bottle with a pretty standard macro label.  appearance: a pale amber yellow in colour with sparse carbonation. a fluffy white head that drops to a thin film sporadic lacing. okay.  aroma: not very much there at all. it was at this time i noticed it was a low carb. oh god.  taste: actually picks up a bit here - some light but quality grains but thats about it. still okay for a low carb.  aftertaste: drops away very quickly as expected. no hop bitterness just a slightest touch of grain.  mouth feel: light in feel with a moderate to higher carbonation. feels pretty much like a standard macro lager which isnt bad for a low carb macro lager.  overall: if my brain fell out and i decided that low carb beers were a good idea (even though carbs are low in beer anyway and it is kilojoules to watch out for) this wouldn\t be a bad one. fortunately i am still have my full faculties however so this is going into the not bad for a low carb but still pretty ordinary as an actual beer category. probably okay for au$43 a case for the hottest of hot days but i\ll still just have my good old carlton mid - cheaper and better.
4113,Pure Blonde,2.19,unpleasant to smelllargely tasteless quite bland.
4114,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4,yeast bomb with banana and clove esters quite nice and a fantastic example of the style.
4115,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.57,white fluffy head more than 2 fingers high slowly recedes to a ring and intermittent film. some lacing. minor to moderate haze. banana esters on nose and taste. really like the heavy body with trace of prickly carbonation on mouthfeel. really like tis a lot.
4116,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.44,beautiful looking beer on the pour....gold color big white head and lots of fluffy lacing. aroma is fresh bread. taste is wonderfully bold and fruity (citrus banana dried fruits) but the finish is creamy smooth. tastes more like a fruity wheat beer than a bock but this is a world-class brew worthy of its reputation. weihenstephaner is my favorite german brewer and this is the best of the best. not too boozy but 7.7% abv is evident.
4117,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.33,yellow-orange body with a nice fluffy head. good lacing. a nice looking beer.  love the clove banana and fruit nose. a bit of the abv is noticeable too.  taste follows nose with everything amped up from the nose. wonderful mix of breads malt banana fruit and clove. strong flavor little booziness and all smooth drinking.  good carbonation and mouthfeel.  a top shelf beer in my book.
4118,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.69,330 ml bottle  pours hazy golden yellow with a lasting creamy white foam head. smells like banana clove apricot orange citrus wheat toasty bready malts some hay apple pear with grassy floral earthy herbal pine. tastes like strong banana clove apricot orange citrus creamy wheat toasty bready malts some apple pear plum with grassy floral earthy herbal pine. feels medium-full bodied creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. overall a really great weizenbock.
4119,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.5,great beer! pours super foamy. pepper and spice heavy yeasty flavors. little strong on the alcohol.
4120,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.89,on my initial pour i was like very good but…after several additional samplings i have changed that to “this is excellent” and possibly my favorite beer currently. pours a hazy golden color with a thick creamy head and significant long lasting lacing. smell is very wheat beer like with a fruit sweet aroma. alcohol content is a little high at 7.7%. my only complaint is the availability sometimes a little hard to find locally.
4121,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.78,poured from 11.2 oz bottle to a weizen glass. looks solid gold slightly hazy unless you swirl and add the sediment at the bottom of the bottle then it gets pretty cloudy. some carbonation bubbles popping up. white head falls to a thin cap. some sticky lacing left behind in the glass. smell is banana clove ripe apple a slight citrus smell. taste starts sweet and fruity with apple banana citrus up front. middle of the sip tastes of clove pepper more banana. finish is spicy with pepper up front clove and allspice mixed in maybe some cinnamon and a long banana clove wheat cracker peppery aftertaste. feel is medium to full bodied with a nice tight carbonation almost coats the tongue. feel is very smooth and easy to drink with a bit of alcohol warming in the end. overall wow! i really love this beer. so much flavor so easy to drink. the abv slows things down a bit but this is worth taking slow. honestly i think i have a new favorite beer.
4122,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.5,i am so glad i tried this beer. pours a hazy gold. the smell of banana and clove is incredible. has a bit of a bubblegum taste with a slight peppery finish. i could drink this all day but with high abv i would be in trouble.
4123,Society & Solitude #6,4.9,#156 good stuff!
4124,Society & Solitude #6,4.25,had a single draft at the mule bar in winooski for eight dollars. my eighth brew reviewed from these guys. very good but not one of their best beers.
4125,Society & Solitude #6,4.49,3 months old. can to wine glass.  l: pours an opaque orangeish yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. no floaters.  s: ripe orange and grapefruit with some piney woody hints. a bit of mango as well.  t: orange mango and peach. a bit piney grassy and herbal. both hoppy and malty. not as sweet as its smell. minimally zesty and a bitter finish.  f: full and creamy. low carbonation.  o: nice east coast/ west coast hybrid ipa uniting fruity citrus notes with piney and grassy hints. as always great craftsmanship from hf.
4126,Society & Solitude #6,4.31,on tap at armsby abbey.  l -- hazy golden orange in the glass with the usual fluffy hf head that lasts and retains wonderfully s -- mango sorbet orange juice yellow grapefruit zest lightly creamy oat malt and a light berry note t -- wave of pithy yet creamy citrus pith citrus flesh and dried blueberry followed by a moderate earthy bitterness that is pronounced but rounded. light malty sweetness makes for a nice tapering finish that continues to be lightly bitter f -- soft fluffy drinkable o -- a hair more bitter than my favorite s&s variants. still fantastic as expected  87/100
4127,Jakobus,3.98,on tap: pale straw with maybe just a bare impression of haze and a sustained full thin white cap. nose is a lemon citrus grain when cold; taste at this time is a slightly stale white bread with a mix of lemon and orange zest. carbonation is medium heft is light and finish is pretty dry and dry grass bitterness.  a peppery note comes out in the nose as it warms and sweet bread flavor starts to gain on the citrus during this time. the balance works itself into an enjoyable experience by a third of the way down the glass.
4128,Jakobus,4.27,lightly foggy yellow-gold with a dense head of white foam.  rounded malt characteristics of corn nut and white wheat are contrasted by a pleasantly grassy bite.
4129,Jakobus,4.16,poured from a 16 oz can dated 06/29/23 so 4 weeks into the test glass. a - beautiful looking offering clear excellent carbonation works in the lemon straw colored backdrop. a tight knit white cap rides the drink to the last sip. s - floral up front with lemongrass being prominent with some time there is a lovely grain  cracker baguette crust thread. as the offering warms a bit there is more noble grassy spring hops in the nose. t - more grainy flavors on the palate but al in that tight window of crusty bread cracker the lemon drp aspect transfers well and balances out the offering. m - snappy those hops keep this on the bitter side of the knives edge with that grain aspect being adding some needed heft. dry finish pulls you toward another sip o - a very snappy bright german style pils one that rewards with every sip
4130,Jakobus,4.59,an easy pour produced a finger of creamy and soapy white foam with very long retention and swatches of lacing. clear golden-straw body with a few fast-rising fine bubbles.  cracker greets the nose first followed closely by toasted wheat bread and dough floral and herbal hops.  semi-dry with big hop flavor yet moderate bitterness at first. matching the smell closely toasted grains are added to the malt taste grass and a hint of lemon joins the hops. a white peppery spicy bitterness builds in. the finish is dry clean crisp and softens quickly peppery spice lingers briefly.  medium light bodied with lots of carbonation a moderate pour yielded a 3-finger head. great balance alcohol is very well hidden. overall bitterness is on the high side but so is the malt flavor true to style thanks to quality ingredients and skillful brewing.
4131,Jakobus,4.6,can. clear gold with ring and island. my dishwasher is broken and my glass was not perfectly clean. earthy noble grassy aroma with hints of honey. medium sweet grainy honey with a touch of light toast. spicy finish cleans it all up and lingers long enough to satisfy but not too long. lively but not fizzy and light. excellent.
4132,Jakobus,4.4,canned 2023/03/21 pours a fizzy bubbly 1/2 finger head with fair retention low lacing very clear blond light pale color  nose plenty of grainy-sweet malt rich grain straw bread dough cereal a bit of decoction like malt depth hint of floral hops with some lemon-lime notes  taste brings more malts up front cereal crackery grainy-sweet malts doughy a bit of straw more layered decoction mash character very soft up front fair herbal floral hops getting a little grassy spicy late hint of lemon-lime as well med-lighter bitterness gradually increasing and then kicks in with a high spicy hop bitterness on the crisp finish long finish as well  mouth is med to a bit lighter bod very soft and delicate med carb  overall very nice german pilsner with unique addition of that lemon-lime character but otherwise nails it again
4133,It Was All A Dream,4.37,pours very dark with minimal head has occasional coconut floaters. aroma is metallic coconut boozy bourbon barrel chocolate. flavor is dark chocolate loads of coconut sweet vanilla boozy middle gentle coffee finish accompanied by a pervasive sweet maple flavor. very thick texture light carbonation adds to a creaminess. overall a delicious ba adjunct stout.  6/14/22 bomber from 2022 wakefest 4.5 rating
4134,Dutch Gold Imported,1.25,in ireland for 12 days and nights. handful of euro notes to spend before next days departure. just enough to buy 3 of these that cost 1 euro apiece. this pours a crystal clear uninviting pale gold. it does pour a head of foam. it is the fastest disappearing head of foam i have ever seen. no side glass lace period. looks like a sample you drop off at the lab for your own personal lab values aroma: a very little bit of grass. taste: is this really beer? the only reason why this beer gets more than the bare minimum 1.00 is that there was nothing offensive in the odor.
4135,Dutch Gold Imported,1.67,appearance: poured from can into (non-real) pint glass in low altitude galway ireland on september 18th 2010. pours a clear yellow with an abominable thin head that quickly reduces to nothing. a pathetic appearance that looks a bit like urine - cant wait.  smell: a nasty aroma of stale hops and overcarbonation. this isnt looking good.  taste: barely one note of light hops bleeding into a sharp finish. theres very little to say about this beers taste. its a bit like water with a beer flavour; in fact the main note is water. this beer is bland uninspired unambitious and poorly built even for the price.  mouthfeel: wet and fizzy throughout. unrefreshing. neither smooth nor coarse but discernably awful.  drinkability: at least its a bit better than most american macro lagers. at this price range if youre just looking to get intoxicated youre better off going with steel reserve. this beer might taste better on the way up. if i werent a broke student i wouldnt be having another.
4136,Dutch Gold Imported,2.49,i am not sure but think this beer can be bought only in ireland where is quite popular in discount stores.  pours golden with arge head that slowly fades scarce patchy lacing. aroma is very light malty. taste is light lemony hops with some sweetish malt nothing complex. light mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  overall it is below average supermarket lager.
4137,Summerfest,1.88,dry bitter pretender of a pilsner. from draft no head flat. slight citrus doughy smell. taste was more bitter than ibu rating. refreshing at first but couldn’t get over the bitter aftertaste that left my mouth dry reaching for water. in fairness maybe it was a bad draft but i will steer clear of this.
4138,Summerfest,3.5,has a beautiful golden color decent head and practically no aroma. the taste is lemony and light. it is a fine and refreshing lager but im more likely to grab a slightly cheaper pack of miller high life or pbr. jeremy piven probably loves this stuff.  style: lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 5% | rating: 3.5
4139,Summerfest,3.75,its definitely better then that pilsner (nooner). its got a slight fruity taste in the background. its a little bitter. i thought this would be much more refreshing. i think its the dry bitterness of it all.
4140,Summerfest,3.5,not a bad beer by any means just kind of boring. imo another over-hopped lager. for those of you who love this stuff i will leave it on the shelf for you. enjoy
4141,Summerfest,3.92,poured from a 12oz can into a half pint glass. pours straw gold with a slight chill haze to it. a finger of soapy white foam head. lemon and herbal notes on the nose. taste follows. it’s super easy drinking. medium-full mouthfeel bordering on thinner. pretty good.
4142,Summerfest,3.94,color is clean and transparent and golden yellow. nose is light lemon and mild yeast taste is a nice lemon tinged malty profile with a subtle hop dryness not too bitter just right. excellent medium body with a smooth and clean finish. some light carbonation through the taste and a bit of thickness at the end.  overall a very worthy beer and one that should be brewed year-round. just a bit different from other bohemian or czech style to make it fun!
4143,Summerfest,3.49,clear as a cloudless day. lemon floral and biscuit on the nose and tongue yum yum
4144,Summerfest,3.88,crystal clear straw yellow voluminous white head of loose/large-ish bubbles but the head goes away pretty quickly. no real lacing. nose and taste are both herbal/grass/ lemon zest with some barely there hop bitterness. very easy drinking. nice mouthfeel with moderate to mild fine carbonation and clean finish. very easy to drink multiples of this on a hot day
4145,Summerfest,2.88,not as refreshing as i was expecting. still drank quite a few though.
4146,Summerfest,2.53,poured from 12oz can into my trusty guinness glass.  golden yellow beer color. nothing unique but it’s pretty. kinda like a newscaster is pretty in a generic way.  smells floral lemony and round. full. not quite lemon pledge but full. even for my poor smelling.  taste: too spicy-hoppy to be refreshing. the can lied to me. tastes like it’s trying hard to be a proper snobby craft beer instead of a drinkable lager. or like sierra nevada just couldn’t help themselves and made another ipa.  feel: a little thick and syrupy. decent carbonation but the overly heavy feel kinda goes with the hifalutin beer thing.  overall: not for me.
4147,Summerfest,4.1,april - july 2023 seasonal release - 6 pack 12 oz. can dated 060523 (6/05/23) - 5.0% abv / 28 ibu brewed and canned in chico ca or mills river nc poured into a bells branded nonic pint glass  look - pours a thin and fizzy off-white head that dies down pretty quickly. crystal clear golden yellow appearance with tons of streaming bubbles. smell - the scent is mostly floral hops and lager yeast. also picking up some woodiness and slight zesty lemon qualities. taste - the taste follows the nose with the floral hops and woodiness dominating the most. the slight bitterness seems to be cancelled by a lemon sweetness in the aftertaste. feel - medium bodied with a semi-crisp mouthfeel and finishes dry. overall - nice hop characteristics for an easy drinking lager.
4148,Summerfest,3.53,meh not up to the hype. not bad not great.
4149,Summerfest,3.71,look - clear pale straw white head that disappeared quickly no lacing smell - floral bready malt light menthol taste - lemon zest grassy bready fruity spice feel - light body and carbonation dry finish overall - so intrigued by all the pics posted and solid reviews of this lager that i had to pick one up and see for myself what all the hype was about. pour was an old school pale straw and the scent brought back memories of the lagers i grew up on. bready malts floral and a hint of menthol on the nose. the taste is bready grassy and fruity but enhanced by the lemon zest and a bit of spice. good brew that is a refreshing summer lager best enjoyed while listening to du hast by rammstein.
4150,Summerfest,4.29,good hop profile. slight lemon and bread taste. great summer beer.
4151,Imperial Jack,2.77,similar to the other rhinelander ipa i have tried odd color for an ipa. nose was almost sour as was taste. not a great beer or even drinkable in my opinion. sorry i had to pour it out.
4152,Imperial Jack,3.55,somewhat british in nature rhinelander brewing takes that uniquely sweet hoppy and balanced taste and simply amps it up.  imperial jack leaps right out with a lightly foggy honey amber for a slight orange appearance. a foamy and froathy cap gives a slight sandy hue that soon succumbs to its strength.  strong malt aromas portray bold elements of peppery hops and their citrusy herbal stone fruit and grassy perfumes with a balanced scent of toast honey and nutiness. flavors of sweetness soon follow with an earthy-sweet taste of caramel barley corn buttered toast sorghum and biscuit.  a rise of british hop flavors reveal aspects of tree bark earthen peat and light walnut provide a nealry tobacco-like sweetness to bridge the sweeter early palate with a more earthen mid-taste. trending toward the bitterness of fresh cut grass and resiny pine the balanced but not overly complex beer fares well but not nearly to the extend of the high ibu rates prescribed by the style.  full bodied to start the beers sweet weight persists into a worty finish with a candied hop balance. finishing malty-sweet and residing slightly on the sweeter side of bitter-sweet the beer may fare well in traditional england as a strong or stock ale but todays imperial ipa have drier more bitter and more hop aromatic standards.
4153,Imperial Jack,3.43,865
4154,Imperial Jack,3.03,this is definitely not a stellar beer. but it is actually drinkable smashable...you just need to give it some help. it looks like a good micro. the aroma is kinda skunky and soapy with a hint of malt base. taste is a bit dank and has almost an apple cider note...again the bit of soapiness. yet it is not terrible for a cheap dipa. reminds me of new belgium imperial ranger ipa. the flavor grows on you but i personally never forget that this is really not good. cheers!
4155,Imperial Jack,1.5,dark orange; very murky.  decent white head strong lacing.  not much of a nose; just a hint of malts & citrus. faint.  heavy mouthfeel.  flavor is faint & bad; like licking an aluminum can. hops are nowhere to be found; i can only hope i got a very old bottle. a bit bitter on the back end but calling this an double ipa is ridiculous.  not going to finish this one.
4156,Imperial Jack,5,dark bold and one my favorite.. cheaper than every other double with just as good taste.. you like heavy beer this is your beer.
4157,Imperial Jack,4,not sure why people rated it so poorly...i enjoyed it. if you like more of a malt forward aipa its pretty good. not too hoppy and doesnt really go down like a double ipa or an ipa. its definitely different. i can smell and taste some banana. goes down smooth for an 8.5%. 6 pack for 6.99. cant go wrong.
4158,Imperial Jack,1.12,imperial jack is the weirdest beer i\ve ever tasted. it cannot be an imperial ipa rather it\s a dank lager with a hint of fumes which escape slightly from the corpses of long dead hops which are completely overpowered by a mash filled dripping sweat sock of malt. the aftertaste hits you in the face like a mud - footed bullying jackrabbit leaving you grimacing and saying to yourself wtf was that? it\s only saving grace is the alcohol content so after a couple bottles you don\t feel bad for having bought a six pack of this swill.
4159,Imperial Jack,3.01,by the date code on my bottle containing 2017 and this being early february i think i bought a fresh bottle. the aroma was of an old beer gone bad. maybe improper handling? maybe a confirmation of previous review. this tasted like an experimental recipe of a a friend who home-brews. time to change it up.
4160,Imperial Jack,4.15,im a huge minhas/rhinelander fan being from wisconsin imperial jack is a dam good beer at a low price point you cant argue with that.
4161,Imperial Jack,2.71,aroma is fairly strong and hoppy with a hint of sour citrus but not remarkable. it pours a clear amber with a so-so pale head that doesn’t last too long. flavor is hoppy a little bitter just slightly fruity barely says it’s an ipa - let alone a double ipa. texture is smooth and firm none too fizzy though it leaves a hoppy and woody finish and a persistent tingle on the lips. fair to middlin’ and leanin’ towards fair. give it a try anyway.
4162,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.39,poured from an undated 24oz can. also does anybody actually know who owns this brand?  on the pour a quite surprising 4 finger albiet quite fizzy white head that dissipates down to 2 fingers after a couple minutes. color is your standard golden yellow straw and carbonation is fine but active. some lacing  smell is generically cheap. light and dominated by mistreated lager yeast. not the most disgusting thing and honestly quite bright smelling but still not good by any means.  taste is syrupy and odd. diacetyl is present and the malt is intensely sweet and syrupy. there is some actual barley present but it\s hiding in the very back. slightly metallic as well.  feel is mouth coating and weirdly flat. maybe this is an old can but there is still carbonation. maybe the liquid just chemically couldnt hold carbonation well. medium long finish that i wish was shorter.  this is a disgrace to market as a pilsner. once g. heileman moved out of la crosse and city brewing took over just figuring out who owns what and even what beer comes out of that brewery is a nightmare. about the only good city brewing beer ive had was montucky cold snacks and that was just a decent lager. this on the other hand is a cheap disgrace. id rather drink colt 45. and to be honest with you the lost lake website says this is higher abv but im not sure if its a typo because the listed abv is the same as the ice version and it really seems like they just dont care.
4163,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.38,i got a 24pck of this beer from the woodmans in la crosse wi whilst moving my daughter to school. it poured a clear golden with no head and no lace. the scent had grain notes. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with good biscuit like presence. the mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. overall it is a good beer.
4164,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.02,$4.49 usd plus tax per sixer of 12 fl oz pull-tab cans at a shitty liquor store (poindexter liquor) in bartlesville oklahoma.  naturally brewed pilsner beer.  off the first sip i\m calling bullshit on the pilsner designation. this is very clearly an adjunct lager...it\s immediately obvious.  a biteen syrupy. driven by a deeply off-putting creamed corn sweetness. cheap 6-row lends more generic malt sweetness.  a bit metallic. certainly too sweet. lacks any balancing hop character.  i wont get into its lack of any noble hop character or pilsner malt since itd be disingenuous...it aint a pilsner its a budget adjunct lager.  but even as a budget adjunct lager its pretty bad to be honest. i often find myself defending the coors banquets and miller high lifes of the world but i can offer no such effort with respect to this...its bad and generic with obvious imbalance and no redeeming characteristics.  even on a budget beer basis it comes up short against ballantine xxx the less repungant malt liquors and many mainstream adjunct lagers (schlitz gusto coors banquet rolling rock miller high life hell even budweiser - yes i said it).  this is in that weird market segment of budget lagers brewed by generic sounding corporate conglomerates by shell companies in wisconsin (this one is brewed by universal sales inc. la crosse wi - i\m sure that\s a down-home operation run by passionate former homebrewers...) and even in that unenviable cohort it\s a loser of a beer.  i feel like i need to wear a wifebeater and have a ball game on (with maybe some casual child abusing thrown in) to be able to appreciate this beer.  low d / not recommended
4165,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,4.28,pleasantly surpised with this one.  l- light golden/yellow....clear...a lot of carbonation bubbles.  s-dry tingling pomegranate australian red licorice  t- full-bodied this delivers bold notes of coffee bean and kola nut along with red pepper on the back of the palate before a long leathery caramelized conclusion. an overture of flavors that’s at times heavy and rich with notes of dark chocolate and wood and other times subtle and understated with hints of fine caramel and toasted almonds.  f-highly carbonated...clean....no off flavors.  o-not what i was expecting but wow is this loaded with flavor for a basic aal.
4166,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.13,a crisp refreshing pilsner. a light beer for a nice outdoor adventure.  taste rating in words: the crisp snap of a stick in the breeze
4167,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.79,i am slowly getting around to reviewing & rating beers for the canquest (tm) that caused my local in-person some cansternation since i was not getting to them quickly enough. fair dinkum but fear no longer @tone77  there is movement!  from the can: made with natural ingredients. serve cold.  made with natural ingredients?!? when has a beer other than a minhas product been made with unnatural ingredients?!? this does not bode well!  i crack!ed open the vent & held my breath hoping for the best but girding for the worst. the glug revealed a gorgeous golden-amber colored (srm = > 5 < 7) beer with ne-quality clarity calling forth the gelt gang of midas mammon & croesus for a taste. they had to wait until the just-better-than-a-finger of dense foamy rocky bone-white had subsided to get at it. nose was not bad kinda grainy trending towards wheat but seemingly adjunct-free. mouthfeel was thin-to-medium mere steps above wateriness. the taste was just too sweet but not metallic or adjunct-ridden. what?!? no discernible noble hops in a pilsner?!? 8=( finish was semi-sweet but more bland than anything else. this one simply lacked ooomph! ymmv.
4168,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,4.19,im going to be honest if you’re struggling with cash and need to get a quick buzz 2 tallboys if these will get you. the taste is more tolerable than most it feels good when it hits your gut and it’s easily drinkable. highly smooth too.
4169,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.86,not a great beer but good for what it is. that is a cheap aal. more body than you might expect. clean dry taste nothing offensive. i have paid more for worse.
4170,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.74,taste: slight hop mellow thin not much zip. mild grain nose.gold clear with white soapy head and delicate lace. lite body. a boating beer that closer to a lite beer.
4171,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,1.87,look - ok to be honest... my rating of the look is not very objective. i know this beer well yet i bought a 24 oz. can (for $1.15 nonetheless) just to have a fresh take on the review but having had this before when i pour it out it looks kind of like they bottled the urine of a dehydrated 95 year old man.  smell - trying to be a little objective here. smells sweeter than id like lots of mixed in adjunct aromas. a little bit of malt.  taste - not the worst beer ive ever had but definitely on the low end. it tastes kinda like an anxiety attack... ok its not that bad. the flavor on the initial draw into the mouth isnt that different from a macro american adjunct lager but the lingering flavors and aftertaste seem more like the metallic powder used to exacerbate the yeild of high explosives... ok its not that bad.  feel - light and watery.  overall - yes i have been heavy handed in this review but do not let that scare you away from this beer. this beer holds a special place in my heart. it is what i call a party beer (but not a frat party beer). this is the kind of beer that the college guy in the studio apartment buys for a party because he\s very poor (yeah that was me). it\s not great but it is serviceable when needed. really it\s not that bad but i\m making this review based on comparison... and by comparison this beer falls quite short of others on flavor and quality.
4172,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.29,poured from a 24 oz. can. has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of corn grains. taste is malts corn grains a touch sweet very easy drinking. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is not a bad beer and at $1.25 for a 24 oz. can its a good value as well.
4173,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,4.19,in my opinion this was a really solid clean tasting beer. i could drink that all day and it tastes nice hbut hey what do i know
4174,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,4.5,
4175,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.5,
4176,West Ashley,4.28,had on tap. cloudy pale yellow pour with a pearl white head. barnyard funk big citrus apricot bright oak and faint flowers in the nose. taste is much the same moderate potency amongst a delicate and artful body. otherwise sour with beautiful oak texture bright and medium bodied with a kiss of acidity
4177,Gumballhead,4,slightly hazy dirty yellow dense white head splotchy lace grapefruit and orange hop aroma grapefruit and mandarin orange hops slight caramel and wheat malt medium light bodied and appropriately carbonated dang good wheat
4178,Gumballhead,4.25,9/15/23 poured from a 12 oz can purchased from washington beer store.  beautiful slightly cloudy yellow with some lacing.  pine lemon rind.  nicely complex and very drinkable. smooth and nicely balanced!
4179,Gumballhead,4.11,12 oz can filled 5/23/23 from a variety 12pk into a pint glass. l: pours 97% clear dark yellow with a bit of yeasty sediment in suspension vg steady carbo a thin soapy white head with no retention light lacing. s: pineapple citrus fairly tropical a hint of apple light dank notes. t: fairly floral with passion fruit bright orange blossom a hint of berries lightly rich with a quick fade of flavors. it has a halo of sour gumball candy and lemon. f: gently crisp med-light body with a wet middle that feels a bit slimy and a med-length soft and lightly dry finish. smooth overall. o: a curiously tasty pale ale that is very easy drinking slick fast finishing and not too dry. not overpowering in any way and is fairly tame by 3 floyds standards. it is excellent in its style.
4180,Gumballhead,4.3,poured cold from a 12-ounce bottle into a weizen glass. bit of a gusher on opening. hazy dark yellow-orange colored body with a magnificent long-lasting snow-white head that left rings of lacing. excellent carbonation start to finish. typical banana/clove aromas and flavors augmented by bright citrus notes and a ton of bitterness. finish is crisp and clean. it is also quite astringent which id guess is due to the yeast sediment (?) present. all in all an outstanding beer.
4181,Gumballhead,2.84,looks the part. smells like a decent apa which is exactly what this garbage is. if i wanted an apa i’d buy alpha king. the only aspect of this beer that represents an “american wheat ale” is the wheat. the rest was brewed as a standard apa. this will be my last go round with this beer.
4182,Gumballhead,3.28,pleasant beer very smooth and once warmed up can taste the lemon coming through. not sure where this sits on a wheat beer scale seems like its top notch on that however but a good change of pace from hop forward ipas
4183,Gumballhead,4.37,i’ve had this beer on tap at the brewery tap room a couple of times over the years and although it was good it never impressed me. maybe due to the fact that i would be drinking zombie dust at the same sitting. today of all places gumballhead was on tap at midway airport (chicago). i was psyched that anything from 3 floyds was on tap at the airport so i decided to have a 20 ounce pour while waiting for my flight to depart. well all i can say is wow. first the beer exceeded my expectations for freshness. i figured i would be getting some old kegged beer that’s been sitting around. not the case this beer was crisp and had some life to it. it was served colder than a wheat pale ale should be but man did it quench my thirst. the beer had an orangish wheaty look to it and had similar aromas. the taste had a touch of sweetness and the bitterness was subdued and hit my palette just right making the beer extremely smooth and drinkable. just a great drinking experience and i have a whole new respect for the quality and taste for this beer.
4184,Gumballhead,4.09,l: translucent light copper color. fine carbonation bubbles throughout. generous head trying to hold on. s: citrusy subtle rather than overpowering t: citrus taste on top of a satisfying wheat base f: matches the carbonation and color very well o: a fine wheat ale. glad 3fs are now in md
4185,Gumballhead,4.09,canned on 8.16.22  12oz can poured into a willi glass  pours bright bjt cloudy golden with a finger foamy head little lacing left behind and settled into a slight ring. 4.25  aroma off the can is mostly lemon dominant citrus. off the glass i get much more hops and then followed by some lemon zest. 4  taste is a fairly mild bitter hoppy and bready mix with lemon peeking its head out. 4  body is even balanced carbo and creamy wheat mix with a residual but subtle bready aftertaste. 4.25  overall a great and very tasty summer wheat beer. more savory than sweet filling over refreshing but very good overall. 4.25
4186,Double Shot,4.6,looks like motor oil completely opaque. foam like dalgona coffee. notes of molasses vanilla and coconut on the nose. taste is nicely balanced with tons of bittersweet chocolate. nice mouthfeel not too heavy. overall a great stout perfect for a late fall day.
4187,Double Shot,4.42,appearance - the beer poured a silky black color with brown bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.  smell - the nose had a strong coffee presence with noted sweetness.  taste -there was a lot of coffee here. notes of chocolate syrup and light vanilla we’re also present. it was not overly sweet to the point of being calling and allowing the coffee to shine. the coffee and chocolate continued in the finish.  mouthfeel - the body was slick and not overly thick with small bubbles.  overall - this is a great stout that coffee stout lovers will love.
4188,Double Shot,4.36,i usually like to sample a base beer before dipping into variants. however when it comes to th i take what i can get when i can get it. so i tried the espresso version of this beer before sampling the og version that is before me now.  pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with over a finger of head that is milk chocolate in color. like the espresso variant i am not overly impressed by the nose - some coffee not much else.  the flavor profile is dominated by fresh black coffee. the bitterness off the roasted beans is the highlight here. the body is hearty and the finish has just enough residual sweetness to counteract the bitter coffee.
4189,Double Shot,4.42,jet black body opaque; thick frothy light brown head long lasting; patchy splotches of foam stick to the glass. rich dark roasted malt smell; cacao nibs and bitter chocolate. rich and flavorful taste; fine blend of sweet and bitter chocolate; chocolate fudge and brownies; bourbon undercurrent; bitter. heavy body; heavy sweetness throughout with a mild dryness at the finish.  ah a coffee stout eh? after the fact i can sense coffee but its well-hidden on my palate. still this is a rich decadent stout and quite the treasure.  pouring temperature: 42 °f; canning info: spring 2023 source: @ocalafox
4190,Double Shot,4.4,big dark foamy head. nice blend of coffee malt and vanilla - smooth.....
4191,Double Shot,4.29,look...a black viscous motor oil with a vibrant chocolaty wealth of big and little bubbles of light brown smell...a rich chocolate and coffee but faint with a malt back. molasses and hint of alcohol taste...a rich roasty chocolate malt with almost no hint of coffee. i think that the coffee presence has been quelled or reduced by the nine months on this beer. anyway a complex sweetness and a bitterness that is definitely overpowered feel...i believe the best quality of this beer. a pesky fullness with the 8.2% abv seemingly heavier to me. to me this is the part of the beer that i fin craft beers are so superior to the huge stout boys like founders sierra just to name a few . the local varieties have a creamier touch overall...this is a sweet stout. i believe the time on this beer (holding it for science haha) has made this beer sweeter than the normal and a practice i would not do to this beer in the future still a well made beer but i like a little more balance of bitter. re-evaluation is in order i believe i liked this beer on the fresher
4192,Double Shot,4.46,received a 16 oz can in a trade from dim 10-19-22. no canning date; consumed 2-12-23.  beer poured black with a pretty tan head that has some good hang time.  nose is nice coffee forward with notes of mildly roasted malts.  taste is really nice a larger medium roasted malt base that is enhanced nicely with a dose of espresso. finished perfectly balanced and no astringency.  mouthfeel is perfection medium bodied and one of the smoothest beers i ever had!  overall this is a really good world class coffee stout!
4193,Double Shot,4.15,from a 16oz can with a ‘spring 2023’ date stamp which inasmuch as it’s still early february puzzles somewhat. served in a tulip.  pours an unhighlighted chestnut-black oily in appearance with a finger of coffee-colored foam. retention is on the order of a minute or two leaving a thin tattered sheet of lacing.  a pleasantly warm and roasty mildly sweet nose. aroma of molasses-sweetened coffee and bakers chocolate. dreamy.  taste is utterly in line with the nose sparing me the trouble of having to think of new words. molasses-sweetened coffee and bakers chocolate. a dulce de leche sort of caramelized milk and vanilla character comes forward with the coffee as the beer sits. there’s an oily prickly tingle throughout which is as much a taste as a feel.  feel is thick and syrupy unctuous heavy bodied with oily super-fine prickly carbonation.  overall overly sweet and syrupy to my tastes. i understand the appeal i just don’t quite share it. still at 8.2% it sure as hell gets the job done i mean right?
4194,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.06,(bbd 28 dec 22) - nitro version. poured a velvety black color from a 14.9 oz. can into a standard pint glass with a creamy finger high head that receded slowly and left curtain lacing that clung to the glass as it dissipated. aroma is earthy and grainy which is fairly standard for the style. taste is chocolate forward but is not overly chocolaty and has hints of chicory roasted malts & grain. mouth is smooth medium bodied with a clean finish and is very drinkable. picked up for under $10 for a 4 pack and was quite pleased wit the purchase.
4195,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.61,very tasty beer. thick... not too heavy!
4196,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.58,poured from a 11.2oz bottle dated 28 jul 22 to a diagonally cut tumbler at fridge temp but was slowly sipped and allowed to warm. the body is opaque black with a short deep tan head on top that fades but provides some quickly disappearing lacing. chocolate is dominant in the smell as is the alcohol. some dried fruit can be sensed also. the taste brings the dried fruit out more prominently; cherrys raisins all “chocolate covered”. this beer bridges between the sweet and the bitter. overall the taste is reminiscent of a box full of a fruity alcohol chocolate sampler. mouthfeel seems rather thin frankly but it does leave your lips sticky. i am not quite sure about how i feel about this beer. it was worth the experience but will not be a repeat purchase.
4197,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.87,16oz nitro can into a pint glass. best before 9/19/22 so a couple weeks late on this one.  looks superb in the glass. jet black body cream colored creamy head which persists throughout leaving a layer of lacing.  creamy aroma but smells a little off.  on tasting not getting as much chocolate as i hoped but a sweet creamy stout with a light roast at the end for balance.  mouth just about reaches medium finish roasty.  overall some flaws in all categories except the look.
4198,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.19,a bit surprised i had never reviewed this beer before.  poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. rich dark brown color with great beige head and nice curtain lacing.smell and taste of dark chocolate and roasted malt. clean not overpowering taste. rich smooth feel. i wish i had another bottle!
4199,Hold On To Sunshine,4.42,super tasty very dark desert beer. very thick and a bit overpowering so one will do it.
4200,Hold On To Sunshine,4,can from jeff thanks for the hookup! inky black with a huge frothy creamy light tan head that slowly recedes. rich milk chocolate and creamed coffee with bits of licorice and dark fruits. pretty nice!
4201,Hold On To Sunshine,4.56,poured from 16oz can into pint glass in february 2023 that i purchased at their brewery in charlton ma. there is a date of winter 2023 on the bottom of the can and i drank this about 1 month after i purchased it.  appearance: very dark black with 1-finger head. the head was dark brown and disappeared after a minute. it left only a little lacing on the glass and no head remained after a minute.  smell: strong mix of aromas filled the room as soon as the can was opened. roasted coffee caramel and chocolate aromas. not much hop style citrus or pine aromas.  taste: there is taste of coffee chocolate and licorice. also some vanilla peanut butter and roasted malt flavors. they are more balanced than i expected from the aroma. flavors are very bold. there is a strong alcohol presence that matches 7.6% advertised. a sweet chocolate and vanilla aftertaste with edge of coffee that is really enjoyable.  mouth-feel: very thick but with an extremely smooth and creamy body.  this is a very good porter and one of the best porters i have ever drank. it has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. the balance of flavors is outstanding. the flavors of coffee and roasted malt nicely balance the bitter coffee with the sweet chocolate and caramel flavors. this is even better than the tree house cartharsis porter which is very good. this is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. i have enjoyed all the beers ive bought at tree house and i would buy this again.
4202,Hold On To Sunshine,4.08,dark brown with a half finger of audibly fizzy dark khaki head that quickly settles into a lasting crown. no real lacing.  roast peanuts peanut butter roasted malt and quality breakfast blend coffee in the aroma.  the taste spotlights peanut butter very light chocolate and caramel and some roastiness from the complementary coffee.  creamy full bodied feel with a mouth-coating oiliness and light zip to the carbonation.  peanut beers aren’t my thing but this is a very nicely made one.
4203,Hold On To Sunshine,4.19,16 oz can no date on the bottom  pours an opaque inky black color thick tan colored head. big chocolate peanut butter aroma. similar taste like a reeses peanut butter cup. not really any coffee detected. fairly sweet definitely a dessert beer. full bodied slick mouthfeel
4204,Hold On To Sunshine,4.56,16 oz can poured into a pint glass. pours black with a nice head. nice peanut butter backbone running through this to compliment the overrriding chocolate flavor. reminds me of an imperfect peanut better cup. very enjoyable stout.
4205,Hold On To Sunshine,4.59,6 months old. can to tumbler.  look: pours pitch black with a full but patchy dark brown head that dissipates quickly. a lot of very fine floaters visible.  smell: peanut butter and milk chocolate combined with some roasty hints. almonds and tobacco appear as the beer warms.  taste: peanuts chocolate and coffee. slightly sweet somehow roasty and minimally bitter.  feel: creamy and oily with a clearly present carbonation. quite smooth.  overall: no barrel-aging no double digit abv but still a fantastic stout with a classic flavor combination. all flavors are incorporated very nicely resulting in a great balance and a smooth drinkability. there are plenty of chocolaty peanut butter stouts out there but this is clearly the best one i‘ve had so far.
4206,Fest of Both Worlds,4.17,incredibly clear light amber appearance. light carbonation with about a medium body. aroma is everything bread. fresh white bread rollsmild cereal and grainfloralhoneyand malt. tqste for the most part stays true to the aromahas a bit of a dry finish. overall its a great beer if you can get your hands on some
4207,Fest of Both Worlds,3.94,sampled this as a side-by-side with the ja munich fest.  pours a clear straw color with a half finger of head. the nose is fairly mild - some essence of biscuits and crackers. the flavor lacks the nutty character of munich fest but by contrast it is much more malty and full-bodied.
4208,Fest of Both Worlds,4.46,received a four-pack courtesy of jzellinger 9-11-23. canned 8-7-23; consumed the first two cans 9-12-23.  beer poured golden with a nice white head that has some good hang time.  nose is fresh bread and notes of herbal and citrus.  taste has a lovely theme of honey bread and is perfectly balanced with hopping that gives a very light touch of pepper and lemon. finishes with the toast and honey flavor.  mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth.  overall what a privilege to be trying this collaboration. this is really well done and thoroughly enjoyable! thank you jeff!
4209,Fest of Both Worlds,4.31,canned 2023/08/07 super excited to try this one. pour a large frothy foamy creamy 3 finger head with good retention fair soapy lacing crystal clear pale color  nose fair grainy sweet doughy malts cereal straw a touch of layered complex decoction herbal floral hops with a touch of a grassy and fruity note more cereal grain as it warms and hint of corn  taste brings a balance of hops and malts doughy malt grainy cereal semi grainy-sweet a touch bready a touch of a biscuity note on the back end a bit of pilsner malt corn fair hops with med-light bitterness floral a bit grassy herbal into a faint piney note and citrusy fruit a hint of the layered decoction mash dry semi crisp finish with med to a bit higher bitterness with a hint of spicy hop note  mouth is med to a bit fuller bod med to higher foamy carb soft lager  overall pretty good i did have super high expectations and it didnt bring as much of the malt-forward character i hoped but still a great festbier
4210,Fest of Both Worlds,3.87,pours a beautiful bright golden with white wispy head. i get a little white grape on the nose with maybe a bit of unsweetened corn cake. its quite grain forward. a touch of soapy noble hops. its light bodied compared to say a house lager. carbonation is super soft. something about this isnt hitting for me and i want to like this more.
4211,Fest of Both Worlds,4.25,a - pours a nice medium gold color with perfect clarity moderate carbonation and a thin creamy layer of bright white foam resting on top.  s - nice herbally earthy citrus spice on the nose. the aroma is really quite nice overall.  t - nice subtle honey malt base with just the right amount of hops over top to balance the beer out perferctly. bright citrus earthyy spice a little bit of pine and a trace of juicy floral really hits the spot.  m - big medium body with prickly carbonation that ends soft on the tongue.  o - this beer is about as perfect as it gets i could drink this year around. really nice and well worth checking out if you like o-fest beers.
4212,Fest of Both Worlds,4.06,16oz can into a tall glass. canned 8/9/23 so a little over 2 weeks old.  looks splendid. crystal clear golden body. small white head persists leaving scattered lacing. strong malty aroma which continues in the taste with a light hop note. smooth and clean nice finish. could drink this all day long.
4213,Fest of Both Worlds,4.37,it pours a bright and crystal clear light honey gold. enormous head of white fluffiness forms with little encouragement although i tend to pour aggressively. it falls to chunks and a ring decent cling. outstanding.  the smell is deliciously malty - not heavy a bit of a blend of crackery and bread dough. the hops are pretty subtle - light citrus and some faint herbal spice some floral over the top. very laid back.  the taste is deceptive to me. it starts off a bit of ho hum but it opens up into a blend of clean malts mild bitterness and then those new world hops blossom. lemony brightness floral and herbal earthiness then a mildly surprising kick of spice in the aftertaste. so some aspects of noble hops playing with more new world character. the bitterness seems appropriate - not quite a complete reset of the taste buds but enough while the aromatic hops continue to play. the lemon eventually seems a bit candy-like. im thinking the malt tends more to the bready side and there is an ever so slight sweetness.  the feel is slick and silky smooth. medium bodied kind of middle of the road carbonation. it has that slightly richer than expected feel ive gotten in other beers using decoction mashing.  this is plain old good stuff in my opinion. i think both teams brought their a game and the result is a beer that starts of with subtlety and finishes in a wholly different place. looking at the style description this beer could be the poster child. ridiculously drinkable.
4214,Eureka - Citra,4,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours a very hazy golden-yellow color with a small head of white foam. the head fades rather fast leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma of the brew is heaviest of a wheaty and grainy smell mixed with a bit of yeast and lemongrass. along with these smells comes a bit of orange and some grapefruit along with notes of tropical fruits of mango and papaya. there is a bit of herb and a little bit of grass rounding out the aroma nicely. taste – the taste begins with a slightly grainy flavor mixed with a decent showing of grapefruit (for the style) and flavors of orange and lemon. at the same time there are flavors of yeast and cracker malt mixed with some other tastes of grass and herb. there is a little bit of a increase in the grapefruit and herb as the taste advances leaving one with a rather clean taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a moderate carbonation bot which are nice for the style and taste making for a nice sipper. overall – a nice easy drinking and flavorful brew. a nice summer time brew.
4215,Eureka - Citra,4.07,a: murky burnt orange and light yellow color with a large 3 finger frothy white head. a bit murky for a blonde but thats ok  s: very delicate aroma. sweet citrus sweet grains and a very faint touch of sweetness. faint onion and pineapple. lemongrass and sweet citrus. nice crackery backbone  t: crackers onion and light pineapple. lemongrass and grains. sweet grains and very faint sweet lemons. lots of dry crackers in here with some oranges  m: light mouthfeel with strong carbonation  o: light and easy to drink. i dont get too much citrus and i might like to see a bit more grainy from a blonde but thats just me. nice one but worthy of the #1 rank....im not sure
4216,Eureka - Citra,4.33,canned 7/12/22. “with citra” stamped on the bottom of the can. thank you tree house i’m aware  alright the last beer from my mini trip to tree house earlier in the week and i saved the best for last. this is the highest rated american blonde ale on ba and i’ve been waiting a long time to catch this one. they’ve only brewed it a few times since i’ve started going but i always seem to miss it. when i saw they had this and i had some free time on a weekday i knew i had to go. let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about  pours a cloudy pale gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  this is super bright and fruity in the nose not really distinguishing itself much from its neipas in that regard but i do enjoy it. i’m picking up on aromas of orange juice lemon zest toasted grain peppery hops crackery malt light toffee and pithy grapefruit  in taste it’s a bit more subdued and traditional and much better than the aroma because of it. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting bready malt pithy grapefruit toasted grain lemon zest floral hops light honey and orange juice. the swallow brings notes of lemon juice crackery malt orange zest floral hops fresh grass white pepper honey and light gooseberry  a light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a very crisp beer. finishes very dry with a slight sweetness for balance  i really enjoyed this one. downright crushable regardless of whether or not you can really define the style but i don’t really care about that
4217,Eureka - Citra,3.79,pours a hazy golden. it tastes how it smells. some light amounts of mango and grapefruit. definitely some residual vegetal hop matter. like in a abrasive hop burn way but close to that. it was light and nice to drink but definitely far from perfect.
4218,Eureka - Citra,4.27,canned: 04/20/21  l: pours a pale gold color with a full haze. a gentle pour gives a finger and a half of fine white head with good retention. the head leaves fat rings of lace as it goes down.  s: oranges grapefruit citrus rind a touch of grainy malt and a hint of tropical fruit.  t: this one is packed with flavor for a 4.2% abv beer. i get orange rind grapefruit flesh a touch of lemon-lime a light grainy malt character lending a touch of sweetness light notes of passionfruit and a bit of herbal bitterness on the backend and finish.  f: medium-light body with medium to medium-low carbonation. the mouthfeel is smooth with a bit of creaminess coming in mid palate and riding to the finish which has very light dryness to it.  o: this is an excellent blonde and an excellent example of what can be done with citra in a low abv beer. if i didnt see the haze i could almost imagine i was drinking a lawsons super session; granted the mouthfeel has definately got a bit of the signature treehouse house style to it. highly recommended!
4219,Eureka - Citra,4.28,a: pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap  s: lots of citrus up front along with some lighter tropical fruit and floral notes  t: follows the nose. starts off with the citrus and then slowly picks up some tropical fruit floral tones and crackery malt. lightly bitter. finishes with lingering citrus  m: light bodied with moderate carbonation. soft  o: a very good blonde ale that does a great job highlighting the citra. super easy to drink. definitely worth checking out
4220,Eureka - Citra,4.35,pours a hazy yellow with a quickly dissipating head. looks more carbonated than a typical th beer maybe because the body is thinner (no surprise at its low abv).  nose is straight citra: grapefruit and lime with just a touch of grass.  really nice body certainly lighter and less fluffy than th ipas but just right for a easy drinker.  flavors are once again pure citra this is just delicious.  a wonderful beer. perfect for a warm afternoon or to cap off a day of heavier beers.
4221,Eureka - Citra,4.3,this beer is a conundrum to me. it doesn’t look like a blonde ale (never seen one that is cloudy) and the mouthfeel is a bit “brighter” than i’ve seen in blonde ales.  but it smells great (obvious citrus aromas given the citra hopping but also a malt note) and it tastes great.  all in all i’m not sure it’s a blonde ale but i am sure that i really like it which is what matters imho.
4222,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.39,750ml waxed and capped bottle into a bbt snifter.  pours as thick as motor oil. dense dark no head or lace but with thick sticky mocha colored legs that stick around. nose is incredibly aromatic. chocolate dense mocha dank espresso all dusted with cocoa powder. beer opens chocolate molasses espresso and mocha. notes of syrup tobacco and barrel in the middle enhance a deep coffee bean presence. more mocha espresso and a funky coffee bean bitterness in the aftertaste. body is thick and chewy with low carbonation. rich and full on the palate and goes down messy. long lingering aftertaste. few imperial stouts rival perenniala consistent body.
4223,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.38,2022 version. this was really good - dark black pour - great viscosity. i think the coffee overpowered the barrel a bit - i wanted more barrel to say the least. very enjoyable but ive had better coffee stouts.
4224,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.43,look - black thick syrup nice rim smell - coffee chocolate barrel taste - same as smell just fantastic feel - thick and creamy medium light carb overall - pretty fantastic
4225,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.5,been sitting on this for awhile and finally cracked it at a share with a few friends. it was well worth the wait! definitely have to have it a little warmer.
4226,Camo Silver Ice,2.5,(24 oz can same as one in photo here 1023 0406 code naturally brewed (in cursive - fancy!); purchased cold single somewhere in the dakotas this past week... poured into a busch pint)  brilliantly-clear gold liquid; foam fireworks upon pour head gone in 20 sec... smells like corn syrup flavored hard candy maybe approaching cough drop territory with its slightly medicinal ethanol; bland expression... tastes like bad malt liquor (stop) mixed with discarded woodchuck cider and left out on the coffee table overnight after a party; cider-blast; virtually no aftertaste; subsequent sips taste mostly of enhanced corn liquid tainted with malt snot... as far as mouthfeel its practically champagne!...  this is in the running for arguably the worst malt liquor thats crossed my lips (its not quite the worst on second thought); what a roller coaster ride these past couple days with some of the worst to the best brands ive ever had; this is trash redeemed only by not having an aftertaste reminder of the trauma youve just experienced (2180)
4227,Camo Silver Ice,3.69,i like malt liquor. i like it rough raw and powerful. not drunk powerful just punchy. theres something classic down-home american about it...like a 1970 chevelle 454. and i like the price of the stuff. no handcrafted pretense. no installment loan required. camo silver ice is affordable and flavorful (if a bit sweet) with no unpleasant aftertaste (unlike like some malt liquors). and camo silver ice is plenty potent: drink it fast and one might wish one hadnt. frankly this brew might merit a 5.0 if it had a little less alcohol so the malt flavor wasnt overpowered by ethanol. dark gold thick and punchy...an ice cold can of camo can last the evening if sipped rather than slammed. sip it in good company slam it at ones peril. good stuff. rock on!
4228,Camo Silver Ice,3.41,24 ounce can into lager glass no can dating. 0170 1459 can code. pours slightly hazy/cloudy medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense/creamy head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. aromas of lemon cracker corn white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. a bit too fruity corn aromas but not overwhelming. okay aromas with pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. taste of lemon cracker corn white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. light-moderate herbal woody floral grassy spicy bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of lemon cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. nicely clean lager flavors; not overly fruity/yeasty. light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and spicy alcohol. medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a creamy/bready/grainy and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is good. a tad rough but smooth to sip on. mild increasing warmth of 10.6% with minimal lingering booze after the finish. overall this is a solid high gravity malt liquor. all around good robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; smooth easy and fairly crisp to sip on slowly with the mellowly bitter/spicy/drying finish. nicely clean/rich pils malt/grain showcase with nice earthy hop presence/balance for the style. not overwhelming on adjuncts. not quite the jet fuel i expected it is quite drinkable. a fairly enjoyable offering for what it was.
4229,Camo Silver Ice,2.34,after the first few sips it gets slightly better but still pretty rough.
4230,Camo Silver Ice,2.3,drank from a glass 40 ounce bottle. scores are based on the style.  look - label looks like it was made in microsoft word. i somehow doubt it was ice brewed for extra smooth taste probably just for more alcohol. the 10.6% is not nearly as advertised as i thought it would be. the beer itself is a decent golden color looks better than some other offerings.  smell - immediately after opening strong wafts of sweet corn and wet grains. nothing too special but nothing bad.  taste - a surprising first hint of sweet and pleasant caramel malt but immediately overpowered by a strong alcohol flavor. if it was a lower percentage it might actually be good.  feel - carbonation and body are fine but the alcohol burn is mighty powerful. your throat will sting and your sinuses will be cleared.  overall - the icarus of malt liquors. it could be something good if it wasnt trying to kill you but instead it flies too close to the sun of having all the alcohol for the least amount of money.
4231,Camo Silver Ice,3.94,camo silver ice 40 is a tasty malt. made to sip slow and enjoy the levels of the buzz it gives you each time you take a snag at it. it gets me where i want to go and i do enjoy the taste when very very cold.
4232,Camo Silver Ice,2.16,24 fl oz can.  d+ / not recommended
4233,Camo Silver Ice,4.37,id never consume this now but in college its a cheap beer to get you wasted so it deserves a high score because it achieves the level of its intention.
4234,Camo Silver Ice,1.22,where to start... uh... ok no prelude... lets just get to it.  look - something is off here. it pours a golden color not unlike a macro adjunct but it has a haze to it that just doesnt seem to be right. remember buffalo bill from silence of the lambs? yeah... looks kinda like that. upgraded from 1 to 1.25 as it does have some (fast dissipating) head that settles into a surprisingly nice little foam ring.  smell - nothing... no im serious... literally nothing! had to bring my wife over and ask for verification. she said she got something but it was very subtle. once it warms a bit it does get somewhat of sweet grain odor but it never really develops a proper smell.  taste - naturally brewed my a**... there ain\t nothing natural about this s***... prior to the first sip i ran in place a bit... like when a god fearing human being sees a wasp on the patio. fear and anxiety ensued. however... tasting in wasn\t quite as bad as confronting the evil that is the wasp (seriously... one of god\s sick little jokes). while this is one step away from worshiping the devil it does develop some adjunct flavor as it warms. i never thought i\d appreciate grainy corny adjunct nastiness... but it was a nice distraction from the actual flavor of this beer.  side note - many have complained about the booziness of this beer... i honestly cannot taste the alcohol (even at 10.6%) over the overall yucky blah in this so-called lager.  feel - its carbonated. i think.  overall - i feel like i need a bible an old priest and a young priest... the fact that i drank 24 oz of this is proof that i am not living right with jesus.
4235,Camo Silver Ice,1.62,grabbed it just to see how bad it was. even as a poor college kid there is better beer i fan afford. i think budweiser is much better. thats..... saying something... drank a victory moon glow and firestone walker wookey jack to clease the palate :d
4236,Camo Silver Ice,1.08, fortune favors the bold .  yeah..well see about that.  l - poured see through piss yellow without any trace of a head  s - this one smelled like some booze. not good booze either. more of the kinda booze that leaves an ever present headache of bastard children after a one night stand turns into an unwanted.comittment and a shotgun wedding type of booze.  t - tases like grain alcohol had geschlechsverkher with a stalk of pesticide ridden corn.  f - numbing at least.  o - this may rival steel reserve in terms of worst beer ive ever consumed.
4237,Camo Silver Ice,1.62,it does exactly what you want it to do. i picked up three of these for $7 and just one of them got me to a real good place. its not for enjoying.
4238,Camo Silver Ice,1.26,in retrospect (about 10 years since ive had one of these) theyre terrible. but i suppose theyre bearable when youre a broke college kid.
4239,Camo Silver Ice,1.5,high abv for $2.49. taste is rough. does the job though
4240,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.38,poured out of a 12 oz bottle into my tulip glass this beer pours a deep dark amber color w/ a creamy looking slightly tan/slightly off-white head thats about an inch thick when first poured. head eventually settles to a very thick coating of surface foam along w/ a thick ring lining the inside of the glass. good lacing here too. aromas of some toasted bready caramel malt sweetness that gives way to some figs and plums along with bourbon oak along w/ a bit of alcohol on the nose. the taste is pretty much exactly the same. w/ the toasted bready caramel malt sweetness followed by suit fruit notes of plum and fig just a hint of spice and bourbon oak. pretty well balanced flavor profile. has a somewhat crisp also smooth and frothy medium to full bodied mouthfeel w/ light to medium carbonation. easy to drink especially for a 12.2% avb beer. has a pretty clean finish and all of the flavors linger nicely on my palate for awhile after each sip.  eric
4241,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.39,dark murky ruby/brown with a small white lasting head. just below average carbonation with about a medium body. it all adds up to a nice feel. aroma is a nice mix of maltdark fruitoakslight medicinal alcohol. taste is maltbrown sugar medicinal alcohol oak with a boozy lasting finish. overall its a top notch beer thats totally worth trying.
4242,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),3.83,poured from a 12-oz bottle well past its date range but … hey it’s 11.2% abv.  appearance: looks like darker apple cider with a 1/2” off-white head that lingered and left nice lacing.  nose: not overwhelming sweet fruit sweet alcohol.  mouthfeel: medium; adequate carbonation.  attack: follows the nose; not as full-flavored as i would expect — maybe the age is important on this one.  finish: just a hint of bitterness; alcohol warms the stomach.  overall: it’s a good beer and again this sample may be affected by age. if it were on a beer list where i’m having dinner i wouldn’t hesitate to order it. it doesn’t though quite measure up to a st. bernardus abt 12.
4243,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.21,look is a deep and dark amber with a pale head that fades quickly smell is malty and sweet pallet has heavy molasses malt and oak with light notes of vanilla and stone fruit. finishes sweet and clingy.
4244,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.25,12oz bottle served in a d\achouffe tulip glass. date stamp on label please enjoy by 30 jun 2024. l070122 10:28.  appearance: slow pour to leave the sediment behind yielded a slightly cloudy dark amber beer with a thin tan head. some occasional islands of lacing noted.  smell: bourbon with a definite belgian yeasty smell - fruity esters and some bready notes.  taste: bourbon again with vanilla candi sugar lots of malt which approaches a danish-like bready flavor probably from the fruity ester flavors. lightly bitter finish.  mouthfeel: nicely smooth with good carbonation for the style. dry finish and a bit warming but not excessively so from the bourbon barrel aging.  overall / drinkability: truth in advertising here with this beer. definitely a bourbon barrel aged quad. the quadrupel is not lost under the barrel aging - the two complement each other nicely. a nice slow sipping beer - very nice.
4245,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),3.99,great aged ale good bourbon after taste strong but not drinking strong
4246,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.01,poured this somewhere between 50-55 degrees. aroma is mostly bourbon and vanilla. taste is mostly bourbon and vanilla with a slight hint of a quad. i would have liked more quad flavor but i guess thats what the sixth glass is for.
4247,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.69,boulevard bourbon barrel quad has a thin egg shell head and a translucent tan appearance with major yeast sediment chunks and some lacing. the aroma is of faint dates and brown bread. the flavor is of bourbon barrel smoke dates golden raisin and brown bread. the body is light to medium and the finish is medium dry. rjt
4248,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.45,6 oz mini-snifter pour on tap at lures bar & grille. pours reddish brown with a small light tan head. good retention. aroma and flavor feature dark fruit (fig) candi sugar bourbon vanilla cherries toffee leather and oak - very complex and well-balanced. hides the 12.2% abv very well. mouthfeel is full and creamy. overall a stellar bba quad.
4249,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.4,had about a 5oz pour from a 40 just to sample it. really didn’t pick up any off flavors at all. fairly easy to drink. i’m sure a headache would result if you drink more than 12oz of this however.
4250,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included.
4251,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.99,poured into a 12oz glass from an undated 25oz can.  on the pour a decent 1.5 finger white head formed. the head has decent retention but its a pretty fast dissipation to a thinner cap. the body is a solid gold with lots of fine carbonation.  aroma us a bit rough. some off apple juice and a bit of a funky lager. a bit malty other than that but meh.  taste has a bit of off flavor. there is a nice malty sweetness right off the bat and its quite attenuated and stays pretty balance. there is a twinge of tartness but for the style this is decent. biscuity finish with a hint of corn.  feel is drinkable and relatively crisp but its not the most chuggable beer with some odd esters here and there. medium finish with a pretty neutral mouthfeel.   overall for the style this is pretty good. i still prefer colt 45 or mickeys but this is a lot better than oe or hurricane. not bad for a cheaper buzz.
4252,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.77,the first time i ran across this beer was 30 years ago in jacksonville fl. i was in florida for the daytona 500 and swung by the anheuser busch brewery in jacksonville on the way to daytona. at that time my beer palate wasn\t all that developed and the extra malt flavor of this beer was appreciated since i was drinking pilsners at the time. 30 years later i stumbled across the 25 oz cans in a local gas station (i never said it was highbrow) and decided to give one a shot. upon arriving home i cracked the can open and poured (most of) the beer into a 16 oz glass. the color is light (for a malt) and the head is respectable due to the fairly high carbonation. the first sip brought back memories of the caramel-malt flavor i remembered from years ago. it was refreshing and was a good match for the 102-degree heat. this is not a complex beer nor is it something that one would go to the ends of the earth for. however it is a good cold beer for a hot afternoon and has fallen back on my lawnmower beer list!
4253,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,5,goes down super easy but dont let the smooth taste fool you! this beer packs a punch which makes it a staple in my house whenever i can find it but lately something has been afoot at the circle k and i cant find it anywhere. pours a nice golden color gives you a little head doesnt have a disturbing odor satisfies your thirst when you take the plunge and doesnt make you regretful in the morning
4254,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.27,40ozer - no date  i bought this in honor of kingcobrajfs thats whats up. looks like urine and doesnt taste much better: intense blast of corn mixed with a touch of grassy hops and garbage can juice  shout out to my cool cobras out there twu
4255,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.36,25 oz can. very aggressive pour yields a huge head over a beautiful golden body... completely fills my gigantic warsteiner mug.  smells like apples.  taste is actually almost decent. vastly superior to the mickeys that i had earlier today.  feels like the king of malt liquors.  overall...i wouldnt be mad if someone gave me a can of this.
4256,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.27,pours golden yellow with a 1 white head which fades to a wisp. moderate lacing.  aroma is grassy bready faint sweetness.  taste is the usual corn associated with cheap beer bready grass light maltiness slight sweetness.  light body moderate carbonation. dry finish.  as far as malt liquor goes this one is fairly ok.
4257,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.51,25oz can born on code 21059. poured into an arcoroc nonic pint glass.  a - pours a clear yellow with a foamy white head that fades to a ring.  s - faint malty and adjunct notes. the smell isnt very strong.  t - taste is somewhat bland. primarily malty corn flavor with a slight alcoholic bitterness at the end.  m - medium-light body medium carbonation. goes down smoothly and finishes dry.  o - inoffensive as far as malt liquors go; will likely pass on it in the future. rated to style ymmv.
4258,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.25,king of the malt liquors. put some lime in there and you got decent high abv beer.
4259,Mickey's,2.6,l- gold body with a white fizzy top that disappeared rather quickly. s- not much at all on the nose. maybe some corn? very faint. t- drier than all other malt liquors that i have tasted. goes down easily. f- full bodied beer. enjoyable mouth feel. o- i picked this up for a dollar a bottle. what could go wrong?
4260,Mickey's,3.77,just a good old cheap american-beer. delicious when served super cold. great summer brew. not a pretentious light beer.
4261,Mickey's,3.16,had mickey\s fine malt liquor at the thunderbird inn savannah poured from 24-oz. can bottom stamped (apparently) best by jun0523 into hotel water glass.  pours light yellow with clarity and 1- to 2-finger foamy near-white head with good retention leaving sticky lace down the glass. hugely sweet malt aroma off pour becoming a little more corn-like with some vague fruitiness and finally a little herbal quality. begins only moderately sweet and surprisingly mouth-filling then its all creamy malt (both barley and corn) until a little unidentifiable (fruity?) wang appears as warms before a drying slightly-bitter herbal finish.  a beautiful pilsner-like appearance delivers . . . not much but a creamy body but not much unpleasant either unless you let it warm up but thats not the proper protocol for malt liquor. better than anticipated. might drink again?
4262,Mickey's,2.47,pours out of the can a crystal clear light yellow-gold with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly. smells malty and grainy not too crazy. tastes follows the nose but the back end has a bit of bitterness. good carbonation that gives it a good mouthfeel that keeps you wanting another sip. surprisingly a good beer.
4263,Mickey's,3.1,thicker slightly heavier version of a miller high life imo. on par with colt 45 possibly better. would revisit and recommend. thick lasting head good lacing good sweet malted barley and maize taste. good product. from enclosed case of 6 pack grenade bottles. best by december 2022.
4264,Mickey's,4.96,my first time it sorta resembles normal american beers but more flavor
4265,Mickey's,3.53,pours a brilliant gold colour with a nice head that evaporated almost instantly. smells cheap and syrupy. the taste is ok way better than i was expecting. i get sweet notes and corny notes it seems thick and viscous. dry mouthfeel june 30 2022
4266,Mickey's,3.32,the king of this category for me. the old pull-tab big-mouths flew down the throat throughout high school and college. stung by the bee way too many times and dont regret a thing.
4267,Pseudo Sue - Peacharine Dry-Hopped,4.21,summer never says die now that toppling goliath has total access to peacharine hops. taking sue to a place where sue has never gone before a more orchard fruit stone fruit and tropical taste comes from the dry hopping regimen that pseudo sue has undertaken  peacharine dry hop speudosue pours with the fresh squeezed pulpish haze of any new england style pale ale and then crowned with a faint tarnish meringue before casting a fragrant stone fruit spell upon the senses. striking the nose with the bold perfume of citrus laden scents softly muddled herb and a bold overcast of stone fruit and the mere scent leaves the mouth salivating. juicy sweet and fruity the malt structures share the light caramel and honey of fructose along with a bready backbone seemingly of shortcake.  as the malts slowly release from the palate the peacharine hops roll in with a confident array that starts with mandarin orange nectarine apricot and mango along with more citrusy flavors of red grapefruit and lemon. the middle palate soon invites the tangy succulence of pineapple passionfruit and cantaloup for an extra measure of juiciness. fresh grass clippings verbena softly shaven pine and the fine hemp-like herbalness of chive create a smooth and spicy pectin bitterness that has the tastebuds begging for more.  like catnip for hopheads the medium bodied beer trends largely crisp and clean with a malty-dry finish. its smooth bitterness keeps in keeping with the pale ale style but its hop-forward attitude has the senses seeing ipa of the highest degree. a medium-long aftertaste of fruit peels vegetal spice and herb evokes the memories of fruit sweet tea and creamsicle.
4268,Blanc De Blancs,4.7,batch #2  clear golden colour with no head  the smell is mouthwatering with a nice tartness some fruity funky notes but quite clean some wood some vinous notes   the taste follows with a very sour profile white stone fruits from the chardonnay the oak is present but compliments well the whole thing. quite balanced. it gets better as it warms up  the mouthfeel is dry but not astringent fine natural carbonation  overall its a pleasure to drink such a nice brew which was waiting in my basement for some years now. not in style if we speak of bière de champagne but a wonderful wild ale with grape
4269,Blanc De Blancs,4.25,tasted from bottle. pours a hazy yellow with slight white head that quickly fades. lots of wine grape notes with some apples and a little pear. tart and sour but overly so. excellent sipper. well done.
4270,Blanc De Blancs,4.9,#121 yum!
4271,Blanc De Blancs,4.43,look - very slight haze bright and golden smell - funky tart lemon grape farmhouse taste - funky tart lemon grape farmhouse like the smell but also has a great woody slight champagne feel - medium body with a champagne carb and dry overall - fantastic
4272,Blanc De Blancs,3.98,very clear light gold body; lively carbonation; no head. nice farmhouse smells; barnyard funk fresh cut hay some lemon and other citrus notes. very pleasant flavors; sweet white wine; green apple lemon raspberry and peach; tart. moderately heavy body; smooth and rather flat; very acidic overall with a touch of underlying sweetness for depth.  i heard good things about this beer and paid a pretty price for it ($65 actually ordered it by mistake but so it goes). overall this is a decent beer for the style but not something i think warrants the price paid for it.  pouring temperature: 49 °f; bottling data: vintage 2020
4273,Blanc De Blancs,4.31,2020 vintage  a huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! it’s the highest rated bière de champagne (and #245 overall) so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on new years eve. the rest of the day/night will consist of old classics but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. let’s get into it  pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. eventually fades to absolutely nothing but its still a decent looking beer  man im really digging the nose on this one funky and delicate at the same time. im picking up on aromas of white grape white wine vinegar tangerine sharp oak and earthy apple  its straight up explosive in taste in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. on the front end of the sip im tasting tart green apple sour white grape wet hay sharp oak lemon zest and crackery malt. the swallow brings notes of earthy white white old leather tart white grape apple skin sharp oak floral honey and lemon zest  a light medium body pairs with fine carbonation resulting in a tart and crisp beer. finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness  this is great stuff and a great kickoff to nye. its been a hell of a 2021 both on here and in my life and general. so cheers ba happy new year!
4274,Blanc De Blancs,4.3,a 375ml bottle blend #2 poured into a 3 fonteinen stemmed glass.  appearance: a clear golden colour with a half finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass while leaving only sparse lacing.  aroma: sweet lightly tart vinous white grape oak honey with light funky notes.  taste: sour tart vinous white wine grapes honey oak funk with notes of sharp acidity but not overly so.  mouthfeel: medium bodied with moderate to soft carbonation.  overall: solid beer with nice aromas and flavours with abv completely hidden.
4275,Blanc De Blancs,4.49,i received a bottle from @fbarber in the nbs bif #14. poured into a side project lambic glass also courtesy of @fbarber. it pours a cloudy bright orange. it looks like orangina. the head fizzled away almost immediately but that is typical for the style. the nose is just superb: like a fine chardonnay; im smelling lemon orange peel and peach. its taste is sublime; funky oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the brettanomyces and native missouri microflora. its so delicate and fine. it has the expected effervescence and it doesnt drink like 10% abv. overall blanc de blancs is an absolute delight. im privileged to have had the chance to try it.
4276,Redbridge,4,quite light and refreshing i enjoyed this for what it was. a little watery but when youre looking for something light this is a good choice!
4277,Redbridge,2.23,wifes friend had this and offered two of these to her. told me to have one and truthfully i was not able to finish it. strange taste to me. guess its the non-gluten. not my kind of beer.
4278,Redbridge,2.7,trying this out as i may need to go gluten free. i so wanted this to be a good alternative. first off its too carbonated for me. the actual flavor is difficult to pin down but im not sure its a beer i could have more than one of...which will please my wife. looking for a better solution.
4279,Redbridge,2.64,date: february 19 2022... occasion: back from the wmc semifinal loss we turn to the office (and i to this beer) to lift our spirits... glassware: baltika stonge... an orange-amber body shows reasonable effervescence that builds a quarter-finger of off-white sudsy head... looks palatable... light lemon zest toasted biscuit faint hard fruits honey and cough drop... a rather clean refreshing cider-like movement through the palate... its start has a bit of hoppy chatter while its finish is refreshingly soft and swift... not much of the limited aroma makes it to the flavor profile--what does is honey pear apple wood and banana... there isnt a lot to its substance but it does hit the genres goal well enough... at its abv% this wins for a long night of drinking... as a stand-alone not too much to celebrate... in can be found in most beer stores so that is also a plus...
4280,Redbridge,1.83,gluten free? yes? taste free? yes! i understand there’s a market for this but this was almost undrinkable and got worse as it warmed. sorghum makes for a funky musty overall aroma and taste. blech.
4281,Redbridge,3.19,purchased as a single bottle from ingles for $1.50. poured into a nonic pint glass.  l - clear amber with a one-finger sudsy off-white head. actually great lacing. s - sweet but not in a sugary way. herbal. some kind of fruit but i cant pin down which one. t - it tastes like literal raw sugar cane minus most of the sweetness - but i can tell its sweet if that makes any sense at all. almost tastes of granny smith apple skin but then it doesnt. a somewhat metallic finish. it doesnt taste objectively bad though. f - medium-light body with nitro-like carbonation. refreshing. wet. crisp. o - this beer\s flavor has to be an acquired taste. not for the reason i see many people drinking it (i don\t) but because it doesn\t taste bad but for the reason that i\m not familiar with the flavors present. it\s this non-cloying sweetness with some sort of herbal vibe minus the herbs. it almost tastes like a sassafras soda but not in any sort of exact sense. it\s almost like malta goya but swap the raisin bran flavor with some mysterious flavor you\ve never had that can only be in the area of molasses - but not really. buy it to try it yourself but i probably won\t again.
4282,Redbridge,5,i have celiac and redbridge is the best tasting gluten free beer!
4283,Redbridge,5,love this! having to be gluten free is the absolute pits and i had no high expectations for this beer. while it doesn\t have that pungent beer smell it\s light and smooth and actually tastes great! i was very pleasantly pleased and will definitely buy this brand again. the beer guy at my local kroger said this was the best gluten free beer on the market. right now i\ll agree!
4284,Redbridge,2.52,recently diagnosed with late-developing celiac disease. looks like its redbridge and other gluten-free offerings going forward for this newly semi-retired reviewer. my reviews will steadily decline going forward. run towards the fire with eyes wide open grinning ear-to-ear my fellow reviewers!
4285,Redbridge,4.9,great finally a true gluten free beer send it to me for life would drink everyday
4286,Redbridge,2.8,i had to try this sorghum-free beer...  ...not that it was bad or good just different. the strangest thing was the smell it had a coca-cola-like odor to my nose. i couldn’t shake it. anyway it’s nothing really bad but certainly nothing special either.
4287,Redbridge,3.42,got this since my girlfriend is gluten free - ive had it occasionally over the years. it wasnt a stunner but felt like a reliable red lager. drinkable and inoffensive.
4288,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.53,resinous and bitter in the first sip with a rounded citra sweetness. each sip gets less bitter and rounder. extremely smooth going down but the mouthfeel could leave more to be desired. aroma is a huge citra bomb and i wish they made candles like this. pretty dang hazy too exactly what youd expect in a neipa.
4289,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.34,canned 4/6/23  i had the og ghost in the machine early last year and while i enjoyed it quite a bit i found the hop burn to be a bit of a problem with it. a ddh version sounds like it could make things even worse on that front but this is a highly regarded beer so i had to order it when i saw it on tavour. let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about  pours a hazy milky yellow with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is aggressive here but it’s aggressive in a great way that does not suggest hop burn. i’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe pineapple juice orange juice bready malt grassy hops dank weed white pepper and a touch of caramel  and unfortunately this one also gets a bit too aggressive in taste but i’m still enjoying it. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting earthy hops orange juice dank weed overripe cantaloupe bready malt white pepper and light pine. the swallow brings notes of earthy hops dank weed orange juice overripe cantaloupe pithy grapefruit bready malt pine pineapple juice and an odd hint of gasoline  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a slick beer. finishes mostly dry and bitter because of the hops burn but it eventually settles out  i really wanted this one to be better than the original but it’s really about the same. a bit less hop burn leads to a greater drinkability but the odd gasoline note prevents me from bumping up the taste score
4290,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.63,poured from a 16oz can into a veil willi becher pint glass. pours a thick milky hazy orange with a finger of bright white foam. candied melons and oranges on the nose. maybe even a little peach as it warms. big citrus in the taste. slightly bitter finish but overall juicy and smooth. thick full mouthfeel. incredible nedipa.
4291,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.54,sweet orange citrus hoppy slightly malty and an orange-tangerine hoppy-dank nose on this one! taste follows with an orange-grapefruit citrus slightly malty and hoppy bitter swallow. this is nice and murky-soft...with some juiciness mid-palate. this is fantastic!
4292,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,5,ddh ghost in the machine pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head that leaves behind a beautiful lacing on the glass.  the aroma is incredibly inviting with prominent notes of tropical fruit citrus and pine. the double dry-hopping process really shines through in the aroma with a depth and complexity that is unmatched.  on the palate the beer is just as impressive. the first sip is bursting with juicy hop flavors with mango passionfruit and grapefruit dominating the taste profile. the bitterness is well-balanced and not overpowering allowing the fruity flavors to shine through. there is also a slight sweetness to the beer likely from the malt bill which provides a pleasant balance to the bitterness.  the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium body that coats the tongue and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. the carbonation is just right providing a refreshing bite without being too fizzy.  overall parish brewing co.s ddh ghost in the machine is an outstanding beer that deserves all the accolades it has received. it is a beautifully crafted ipa that is both complex and balanced with a flavor profile that will please both hop-heads and beer novices alike. highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch ipa experience.
4293,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.49,12 oz bottle cold into a can glass. pours hazed orange white foam. big time aroma! hops hops and juicy juice. taste follows exactly citra hops really dominate in the best possible way. grapefruit lemon & orange flavors compete for dominance. then the resiny hops chase everything down the throat leaving a great fruity bitter finish with a hint of alcohol burn. feel is medium heavy. mediun carbonation. overall citra is the sensation in this well executed neipa.
4294,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.21,draft poured into a 9 oz collins glass. looks like orange juice in the bar light hazy. nice foamy head good lacing. citrusy smell lemony taste initially but then becomes piney hoppy. overall an exemplar of neipa. not my favorite style but i think i’ll have another.
4295,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.47,this was a share at my local beer enthusiast club bottle shop iron & glass. look is orange haze. smells of citra to the second power. absolute juice bomb medium feel. overall an amazing ne ipa.
4296,Porter,3.26,pours darkest brown into my guinness glass. tall head that shrinks to about 1/3 inch and stays.  no strong smell to me.  tastes more bitter than i expected it would. lots of roast coffee dark cocoa flavors no real sweetness. i’m not getting the graham cracker that the label tells me about. lots of dark chocolate still.  feels good. medium body not light at all but not heavy. not much carbonation sting. a little on the top at the front but it fades before the swallow.  overall: good if you want to drink unsweetened cocoa and get a buzz.
4297,Porter,4.28,very dark black coffee color with ruby highlights moderate but lasting milk chocolate colored creamy head and some decent lacing. the aroma is dark roasted malt coffee burnt toast dark chocolate some hints of caramel and vanilla. the taste is all of that with a bit more emphasis on the burnt toast and dark roast coffee giving a pleasant bitterness. the body is medium/full moderate carbonation creamy smooth very drinkable and inviting. altogether this is an outstanding example of a robust porter incredibly smooth moderate bitterness very enjoyable even better as it warms up a little.
4298,Porter,4.29,not had in a few years - this is a classic done right. pours just short of black with a finger of creamy tan coloured head. nose strikingly chocolate some vanilla and coffee roasty but the chocolate shines. the palate is attacked more with the roasty notes - coffee a bit of char; hint of vanilla and a dark chocolate bitterness that betrays the more milk chocolate nose. medium mouthfeel - creamy with a lasting cafe au lait bittersweetness. smooth as heck.
4299,Porter,4.71,very good porter
4300,Porter,4.53,on tap at the brewery.  appearance: very dark brown nearly black. small tan head lingered and left moderate lacing.  nose: rich roast.  mouthfeel: medium enough carbonation.  attack: omigoodness — roasted malt dominates deep flavor — the beer shines here. just the slightest smokiness.  finish: gentle bitterness from the malt — perfect.  overall: outstanding flavor —clearly deserves its #1 rating in its category.
4301,Porter,4.71,always keep some in my frig!
4302,Porter,4.14,had on tap at bulldog saloon lynnwood wa
4303,Porter,4.34,appearance absolutely black out. pitch black in all regards with no red or brown on the edges. the pour produced a hefty three fingers of off-white head.  aroma lots of roast and i mean a lot. its like a cup of coffee though i dont think it is specifically brewed with any coffee. i get some sweet caramel notes and even some vanilla. a good hint of chocolate syrup rounds out what is turning into a decadent dessert beer.  taste i tell ya that roast from the aroma is singing just as loud and proud here on the taste. its bordering on burnt coffee but is reeled in just enough where it is just dark roast. with that comes a big blast of bitterness but it is quite pleasant. my next swig just got me a ton of that chocolate syrup which brings us right back to dessert beer territory. subtle caramel notes in the front and the end is more of that coffee bitterness.  mouthfeel not too thick but not watered down. very smooth and velvety as the brewers description prepared me for. despite all that coffee bitterness it is a pleasure to drink and it doesnt leave behind a sticky film despite all the sweet flavors.  overall lives up to its reputation and then some. its a robust porter at a reasonable abv and is available year round. a winner in all aspects.
4304,Porter,4.08,a fairly straightforward brew. not as sweet or milky as i expected from the nose. expresso dark chocolate hoppy bitterness i get the graham cracker and faint sweetness. taste is rich and unfortunately mouthfeel lacks silkiness to support that. overall pretty good though i prefer their stouts.
4305,Porter,4.58,bottled 2.1.23  poured into a willi glass at fridge temp and letting warm up.  pours a deep brown coffee totally opaque and with a tall head (aggressive pour my bad) but leaves behind a fine and spidery lacing with a tall domed cap. settled into a 1/4 ring with no signs of disappearing. 4.5  off the bottle i get some dark and roasty coffee but accompanied by a fair bit of sweetness too. off the glass i pick up the same but the sweetness gives off a bit of char and a bigger dose of roasted malts. 4.5  dark coffee again char good punch of hop balance bitterness of coffee starts to come out as it warms up. 4.5  body is incredibly soft and rich with a slight oiliness and mouthcoating. carbo is very light and delicate even for being freshly bottled i could swear it was aged. 4.75  overall likely the best porter ill ever have and was not left disappointed at all. 4.75
4306,Porter,4.17,a- jet black with some brown mixed in brown fluffy head looks great  s- huge roasty malt chocolate espresso toffee  t-toasted malt some bitterness smoke oak butterscotch  m- thinner than expected but good  o- it’s almost a stout. and it’s great
4307,Porter,4.25,a highly hopped brew with coffee chocolate & roasted and burnt flavor. the color is inky black but balanced. the abv is well hidden at 6.5%. overall if you like espresso you will like this beer.
4308,Porter,4.25,poured into a tall clear pint glass. matte black in appearance brown head around a finger thick.  aroma: dark chocolate smoke/charred wood espresso roasted malts dark fruit toffee dark caramel nuts.  taste follows the aroma mostly comprised of the dark chocolate espresso and smoky flavor. hoppy and not as sweet as the smell may suggest. body is medium-light.
4309,Doubleganger,4.9,#181 yummy!
4310,Doubleganger,4.57,a - pours a hazy orange with a two finger sturdy white head. insane amount of soapy lacing.  s - aroma is peach pineapple and mango.  t - the taste is nectarine pineapple passionfruit grapefruit and grassy hops.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. pillowy mouthfeel with a soft finish.  o - top notch.
4311,Doubleganger,4.5,poured on 1/7/2023 from a 16oz can into a snifter glass.  a: the beer is a deep gold color with a large foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  s: the aroma contains strong floral and dank hops strong juicy citrus & tropical fruit and caramelized malts.  t: the taste likewise starts out with a strong floral and dank hops bitterness that is quickly followed by a very strong and juicy citrus & tropical fruit sweetness. the malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. the after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.  m: crisp and very smooth medium body medium carbonation finish is slightly sticky.  o: very tasty goes down quite easily not too filling good kick very good representation of style. this is a very nice dneipa to drink for a long time.
4312,Doubleganger,4.65,look - thick bring slight haze orange with a frothy white head and lacing smell - sooo tropical taste - tropical easy going feel - medium full body with a medium light carb overall - pretty fantastic!
4313,Doubleganger,4.27,appearance: pours a cloudy orange color with a two finger head; strong retention and streaks of lace  smell: dank aromatics with passionfruit and pithy orange tones  taste: orange pith at the outset with passionfruit adding a milder aspect; pretty high bitterness after the swallow  mouthfeel: medium to full body with moderate carbonation  overall: a bit more like the west coast than other tree house beers  thanks devoured_by_vermin for the opportunity
4314,Doubleganger,4.54,poured from a can 3 weeks from canning into a willi. very aromatic on the nose - very tropical with a mango and citrus. similar notes on the palate with just a foamy pillowy balance that tree house is known for. very mild bitterness. theres nothing different here. definitely one of their better offerings. id love to just have a four pack of this in my fridge at all times. just a top notch neipa.
4315,Doubleganger,4.68,nice and hazy. two finger head that dissipated in a short time. some lacing. i was interrupted after pouring it. so i may have to have another and reevaluate the “look” aspect of this beer. great smooth fruit hoppy flavor with kind of a syrupy finish. treehouse makes great beers and this is one of their best.
4316,Doubleganger,4.54,canned 8/15/22. purchased 8/16/22 at charlton.  l: pours a hazy deep gold with a white fluffy head with big bubbles. pretty and irregular lacing.  a: aromas of mango peach and tangerine. more complex as it warms.  t: follows the nose beautifully up front then a surprising hop punch - with no burn - in the middle. finishes dry but not too bitter.  f: soft mouthfeel. medium carbonation. pleasantly sticky and resinous aftermath.  o: this is a typical tree house tropical/citrus delight until the mid-palate hop jab sets it apart. not necessarily better than the standard offerings but a bit more distinctive.
4317,Cerveza Aguila,2.68,cold beer from colombia. if you’re seaside and want fizzy flavored corn water have at it. looking for good beer? search on..
4318,Cerveza Aguila,3.14,the pour is golden yellow with a moderate amount of carbonation. the taste is grains & mild corn. oh well it was interesting to try a beer from colombia. cheers! b-
4319,Cerveza Aguila,3.02,bottle from half time country tick brilliantly clear medium gold in color with a small bubbly white head fed by a steady stream of carb bubbles. cereal grain and light green apple with faint earthy spicy hops. typical macro not offensive.
4320,Cerveza Aguila,3.81,this was given to me by a friend who picked it up while on a cruise. he said it was the worst beer ever but i found it to be a pleasant surprise. poured from a 473-ml can into a lager flute. very nice appearance with a thick snowy white head atop a pale golden colored body. aromas and flavors of light biscuit and notes of grass grain and herbal hops. there is a spicy hop kick on the palate with some pleasant bitterness and a crisp dry finish. light bodied as expected with a little sweetness that is not at all overpowering. recommended if you can find it.
4321,Cerveza Aguila,2.93,there is a lesson here: that when you chase getting beers from countries as i have (columbia is my 63rd) then you are far more likely to end-up drinking beer that is not as good as you like to drink. so it is with aguila.  there are adjunct lagers that define the style... and then there are those who brew but dont have lots of competition. i suspect aguila is a product of the latter.  aguila looks of average color but mine is almost non-existent foam. smells are pleasant (almost a faint hard fruit in there) but then it fades to not much quickly. tastes are so nondescript that i almost want my money back (but the goal was to get to 63 countries.) feel is semi-dry like most good aals but aguila is thinner than at least half of the competition .  as for who barranquilla is and who owns them that is above my pay scale. google says they are columbia\s #1 beer because it is balanced (not too far from my truth) and that it is owned by millercoors. then ratebeer claims barranquilla (now bavaria) is owned by ab inbev. regardless of who owns them i\m not getting rich off of any of them... or are they elevating my enjoyment.
4322,Cerveza Aguila,3.74,decanted from a 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; best by june 20 2019. a: pours a crystal clear golden color with a one finger foamy white head brief retention bit little lacing. s: grainy and grassy aromas with an apple note. t: dry. fruity (apple) and very lightly malty with light bitterness only enough to create crispness and balance. m: light bodied with low carbonation. drinks smoothly crisply and cleanly. o: this is a solidly constructed lager. i would say a cut above most aals international or domestic.
4323,Cerveza Aguila,3.19,from the 11.2 fl. oz. bottle with no date shown. sampled on march 15 2019.  yellow bubbly and carbonated pour with good clarity and a fizzy short-lived white head.  like all these adjuncts i pick up a kind of crackery and gassy sensation on the nose. it seems to be sweet but it does not put me off worth at least a 3 rating based on the style elements.
4324,Munich Fest,3.99,an easy pour yielded a fat finger of creamy off-white foam with average retention no lasting lacing. clear golden straw body golden yellow in sun light. fine rising bubbles support a lasting ring and cap.  cracker and toasted wheat bread greets the nose with somewhat mild herbal/floral hops. bread dough is noticeable with raisin and apple cider.  neutral taste with above average bitterness herbal hop flavor is moderate overall bitterness is on the high side. as in the smell there is malty bread wheat cracker and a faint apple cider tartness. bitterness builds to above average white peppery with a hint of cajun spice. semi-dry at the finish-almost crisp-bitterness last and lingers peppery and spicy.  medium-light bodied with lasting effervescent carbonation. the ipa level bitterness takes away (just a bit) from the balance cant call this one smooth but close. alcohol is hop hidden and it warms well. jacks abby known for hoppy lagers went a little heavy for this style. great looks and appropriate smell it doesnt quaff quite as well as most.
4325,Munich Fest,3.99,sampled this as a side-by-side with the ja collab fest of both worlds.  pours a clear straw color with a half finger of head. the nose has modest notes of sweet maltiness and toasted bread. the flavor has that slightly sweet nutty character that i like so much in this style. the body is lighter that the fest of both worlds.  id give this offering the slight nod over the collab. but neither would crack my top tier for the style.
4326,Munich Fest,3.95,16oz can into a pint glass. canned 7/25/23 so coming up on 2 months old.  rich golden body but the head quickly disappears. clean malty aroma. quite sweet a faint suggestion of hop. body is much thicker than you would think. sweet and clean in the finish even a little warming.
4327,Munich Fest,4,pours a nice clear light amber color with a nice head and lacing aroma has malt and hop hints taste has hop and malt flavors a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a good festbier
4328,Munich Fest,4.25,on tap pours a clear deep gold. smell and taste feature toasty malts and spicy slightly floral hops. a ton of flavor in a nice-drinking beer. excellent.
4329,Munich Fest,4.5,had this on tap at the source poured into a fest beer style stein! pours a crystal clear orange yellow color with a medium bodied white colored head that left some lacing down the glass. it smells of sweet toasted malts and a hint of hops. tastes of sweet toasted malts and light hops its a very good munich style fest lager. it was very fresh crisp clean perfect amount of carbonation. excellent beer!
4330,Munich Fest,4.03,pours clear orange gold in color with one quarter inch head. taste is white bread toasted malt and floral hops. medium light body medium low carbonation slightly sweet. another exceptional lager from jacks. certainly reminds me of the beer i had in munich.
4331,Munich Fest,4.34,on tap at aurora brew works in east aurora ny.  this one pours a clear straw yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells like biscuity malt spicy and floral hops toast and a light fruitiness.  as expected this is quite nice. its super clean and smooth with a wonderful lightly sweet toasted malt breadiness to it and a touch of slightly spicy and floral hop character.  this is light bodied with a great drinkability and a refreshing crispness.  i had been meaning to try this for a while and im glad i randomly came across it.
4332,Munich Fest,4.21,pours a clear yellow straw color with visible carbonation. a thumb length foam head shows great retention.  the nose yields a malt forward sweetness. this includes notes of honey and biscuity malt along with caramel. there is also a touch of orchard fruit.  sweet and doughy malt flavors evoke chewy biscuit toasted bread honey and caramel. balanced with yeasty spices and a modest hops bitterness. notes of grassy and earthy hops flavors and light touches of orchard fruit. the finish adds a kick of crispness and is dry.  medium bodied and moderately carbonated. the mouthfeel combines soft malt smoothness with a crisp finish.  another quality lager from jack’s abby. robustly flavored yet easy to drink.
4333,World Wide Stout,4.57,1000th ba review - 12 ounce bottle purchased in redding ca at a bevmo in august 2017. 6 ounce pour. pours a rich black colour with scant brown head that emerges briefly with swirling. aroma awakens as warms - bready malt caramel fudge; there is a note of raisin brown sugar but also a bit of char and some wafting booziness. taste is a bittersweet blend of cocoa toffee brown sugar a hint of coffee raisin and bready malt with an earthy hop bite. the sweetness is accented by the distinct booziness that manages to not be overpowering (but this is a sipper). full rich mouthfeel - sweet but never cloying - leaving with that warming boozy after burn.
4334,World Wide Stout,4.85,a: pours a very bark black color. the head on top is a deep brown. by the looks of it you know its going to be strong.  s: the smell of this beer consists of both bourbon and coffee. the aroma lets you know that the taste will be rich.  t: very rich in flavor. you can taste chocolate coffee plum and bourbon. the beer is very rich an wonderful with its taste.  mf: this is a heavy full bodied beer.  o: excellent imperial stout. i toughly enjoyed this one.
4335,World Wide Stout,4.25,pours dark as night. tan foam. earthy aroma. big sweet roasted malt body. cocoa and coffee. very heavy. alcohol not as prominent as you would think. bitter finish. a very good imperial stout.
4336,World Wide Stout,4.41,poured from a bottle with date of: 11/07/09! purchased from the rehoboth beach location a few years back by a friend.  pours a thick black. smells like it’s been barreled aged! tastes like a vintage sherry. decadently sweet but not in an off putting way. drinks like liquid figgy pudding.!
4337,World Wide Stout,4.5,i tried a 10oz glass of this beer off the tapper at dry ground brewing as a guest tap in paducah kentucky. it poured an opaque dark with thin tan head that did not leave much lace. the scent had subtle common russian stout notes. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip. there was dark chocolate roast malt and subtle bitter hop presence. the mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. overall it is a solid beer.
4338,World Wide Stout,3.95,2016 vintage. from the bottle it pours a deep dark brown/black color with a tiny head that soon dissipates. the nose gets burnt malts and alcohol. the mouth gets a smooth creamy black malt flavored brew. a real sippin brew. 2019 vintage enjoyed in 2023 - still yummy after all these years!
4339,World Wide Stout,4,super high alcohol content. it tastes good but it doesn’t really taste great because it is like drinking toasty booze. fun to try once but not really worth having more thn once or twice a year due to the super high price.
4340,World Wide Stout,4,dark brown with a ruby hue and two fat fingers of airy mocha-colored head. rocky dissipation fairly quickly settles into wisp and crown.  big aroma of chocolate cherry cordials and finger nail polish. strong umami and shoe leather behind.  plenty of umami and leather in the taste. a good kiss of chocolate and plum too. a bit of root beer. decent alcohol heat. relatively dry finish.  slick oily feel. light carbonation.  tasty and complex. 11/1/16 bottling.
4341,World Wide Stout,3.99,2019 version coffee bean variant.
4342,White,4.73,lovely pale-white color in the glass good retention on a 3-finger head. nose is cloves banana orange herbal citrus and a bit of yeasty lemon pee and wheat sweetness. most of this follows through on the palate but the banana is less present. i do get more grapefruit peel and yeast notes. the texture is velvety and creamy. one of my favorite beers.
4343,White,4.26,pours hazy white with light head. aromas of spice and fruit. getting grapefruit or grapefruit peel like tastes but very nice overall. also notice that there are sour notes which is somewhat unpleasant but because of the other tastes its overall very nice. has a medium feel in the mouth.  overall one of the nicer wheat beers ive tried.
4344,White,4,ive had many a witbier but this was the first i recall that actually tasted like toast. surprisingly light but still left me wanting to squeeze a lemon wedge into it. great accompaniment to heavy food.
4345,White,4.25,12oz can.  pours cloudy yellow with an inch-plus head of white. plenty of tattered lacing and persistent retention. hints of spicy citrus in the nose an a wheaty twang. light bodied with a creamy soft mouthfeel. faint lemon and citrus zest on the palate. finishes dry with zero malt a balancing bitterness and fading spice.
4346,White,4.94,one of the best
4347,White,5,honestly its like my favorite beer. the perfect amount of every quality a beer can have. it fits every day and every situation. if i cant decide what to buy i buy white.
4348,White,4.21,7/9/23 on tap at mad mex at robinson center. get together with tom and sarah.  this beer was not on my radar to date.... boy i i have been missing something!  beautiful all around look taste and feel. citrusy spicy and very drinkable! (dw not around to help with better description!)
4349,White,4.87,this classic is a go to summer holiday beer just had it on the fourth of july  when it was hot as hades and this was the balm. served cold on a hot day pours pale straw yellow with a frothy head smell light hint of orange taste cracker hint of spice hint of orange. light carbonation easy drinking highest recommendation. easily one of my favorite beers and a founding father of craft beer!
4350,White,3.99,poured from a can into a pint glass. pours straw yellow with a fluffy white head. smells of sweet wheat and citrus. tastes of citrus especially orange with nice wheat. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall a very good beer.
4351,White,4.41,one of my favorites highly recommend.
4352,Famosa (Gallo),2.71,12 ounce bottle poured into a shaker style pint glass. best by: mar/24  l: very clear and pale half inch white head has medium retention lively pour. s: lots of skunk aroma at first pour after it off-gases mineral bread grain corn syrup. t: clean lager subtle flavor light grainy malt with hints of bready sweetness dry green/floral finish. f: very crisp light body a little numbing tongue coat. o: poor but drinkable.
4353,Famosa (Gallo),2,picked up a 15 pack of cans expecting very little. indeed it is everything you would expect it to be and less. if average fizzy lager were to be a rooster and espanol it would appear in 2d and be on a 3d can. no need to mention anything else about the beer. drink it cold.
4354,Famosa (Gallo),2.48,look: it pours golden and clear with a white head. head retention is low.  smell: it has corn aromas with some grass. there are hints of sweetness in the background.  taste: there are corn flavors and it is quite syrupy. there are some grassy hops in the background.  feel: it has a medium light body and it finishes sweet.  overall the flavors are standard for pale lagers but the syrup notes are quite different.
4355,Famosa (Gallo),3.24,from a 12 oz can with a bb date of mar 2024. theyre optimistic since im sampling it may 25 2023.  golden-yellow appearance with great clarity and a modest white head. busy carbonation.  typical mass produced aroma of cooked grain bread corn syrup and a whiff of floral or grassy hops.  light to medium mouthfeel. better than some of its ilk.  sweet grainy and bready taste. nothing that really stands out. crisp finish. easy to pound it down.
4356,Famosa (Gallo),4,taking a trip to guatemala we have famosa lager. it pours a straw gold with a quickly disappearing white head. it smells of malt and the taste follows suit. the body is pleasant and leaves you ready for another sip. in a blind taste test id have thought this was german. i would absolutely drink this again.
4357,Famosa (Gallo),3.74,cervecería centro americana s.a. famosa american adjunct lager 5% abv. pours light golden with a 3-finger white head that left some lacing. nose is malty and sweet. taste is malty slightly sweet slightly bitter and faintly tart. the first sip seemed over-carbonated and alka-seltzer like but after it sat a few minutes it seems fine. overall very good.
4358,Famosa (Gallo),4.33,40ozer - oops i mean 33.8ozer  clear pale yellow lacing on the glass. smells like sweet corn dough just slightly sour. drinks surprisingly clean just a very faint aftertaste of garbage juice and booze mildly bitter. i plan on buying this one again
4359,Famosa (Gallo),5,its not gallo beer being rated here it is famosa beer being rated. its like an american version of sofia vergara. it doesnt compare.
4360,Famosa (Gallo),2.75,its pretty average. very light in color with minimal head. slightly skunky bready non- offensive flavor. quickly dissipating head almost non- existent. easily poundable and inexpensive on sale at 10 bucks a 12 pack at fresco here in central florida. overall average af to say the least though drinkable and not undesirable. for a cheap summertime brew not bad. nice and light with a slight bit of flavor and hugely refreshing. although i prefer icehouse or budweiser to this stuff to be honest. definitely not my weekend truck washing/ grass cutting beer for sure but i would take it over natty ice any day. great brew to try out if you havent already but wont be rushing back for more. its ok if ya get it on sale. worth a shot.
4361,Famosa (Gallo),1.38,shared bottle at local tasting as famosa. pale golden colour low white head. artificial and chemical sweetish / sourish aroma. sourish flavour otherwise bland as hell dust no bitterness
4362,Famosa (Gallo),3.73,funny that this is rated as awful. for what this is and the travel it goes through as well and the unique quality it has over other beers from its region make me question if reviewers are simply saying its bad because its not an imp stout or ipa.  it looks like every other adjunct lager yes. but the smells are spicy and herbal underlying beneath a cracker base. the flavor follows the nose and is pretty unique given the region and style it comes from as previously stated. the feel is light enough and inoffensive.  if you are comparing this beer to american craft beers then youre doing it wrong. if all you drink is a dipa then why even bother with this. from a point of view of this thats why i believe the rating is low. if you like clean lagers then this is a great beer.
4363,Bard's Gold,3.35,date: 2/16/21; i am not seeking a gluten-free beer. however having a family member who cannot drink beer because of gluten; having produced sorghum from sugar cane in a previous job; and knowing that sorghum has a smell and viscosity similar to canned malt from previous brews this beer piqued my interest. when pouring from the can i was surprised by the light color since sorghum has a dark amber hue. i was disappointed with the head which quickly disappeared (apparently a trait of malt-free beverages). i began to think i was drinking a bud-light. i was wrong. the smell had a hint of sorghum nothing powerful since there was no head to capture it. the taste was subtle but having a palate for ipas this is what i expected. first sip to last i enjoyed this beer. the second can was as good as the first. i imagine i would enjoy it more on a warm summer day after cutting the lawn.
4364,Bard's Gold,5,tonight i had my first bards gold and i am pleasantly surprised. my first thought is this is exactly what michelob light or bud light should taste like and if i remember both beers used to taste better but now taste like water especially bud light. it had a nice bold taste good flavor and sits well with my dinner. this is a new beer at my liquor store and ill be buying it again.
4365,Bard's Gold,1.56,date: march 28 2020.... occasion: two weeks into the covid-19 quarantine still (mostly) gluten-free i measure a beer shared by my coors light-loving friend billy... glassware: 22oz. pilsner... pours a tawny sallow champagne-tinged body with active effervescence... its head does the usual malt-free disappearing act though its bubbles continue to rise and disperse at the weight of air... really not appealing in this light... immediate sorghum hard fruits like apple banana and pear candied sugars cosmetic counter perfume overload and a base solvency... nothing really alluring here unless you dig cider or sorghum... its first sip is dry thin nearly lifeless (watery) and without fanfare... a late bubble in the throat may suggest its intentions but it doesnt muster much beyond a thin rinse... i turn to billy and his reaction suggest coors light has not been approximated... the flavor is constantly ebbing with faint hints of berry apple sorghum cheerio and bubblegum fluttering in and out of the picture elusively if not frustratingly so... its singular profile doesnt leave much else to say so i end with a simple disclaimer: if you have already enjoyed malted beer in any form theres no need to dance with this one.... if you are a celiac sufferer maybe these will grow on you... all the same cider might be a better option...
4366,Bard's Gold,2.55,the smell reminds me of a gluten beer i had many years ago but really cant put my finger on it - an amber ale or an english or epic pale ale? the mouthfeel and actual taste are not very beer-like overall. candy syrup possibly molasses but not much flavour. the telltale sorghum astringency is there which slowly builds up as i drink. youd probably get used to this overall if you drank it a lot.  for a sorghum beer the sorghum is pretty well masked. drinking multiple beers in a single session is the real test but not sure ill be up for the challenge. this is probably preferable to cider but overall feels like a weird soft drink. as i live in australia i had to buy a whole box to get my hands on this. hmm.
4367,Bard's Gold,2.01,well as other reviewers have stated it just doesn’t taste like beer. how do you make beer without wheat barley rye or oats? obviously you can’t if this is the only answer. not my cup of tea... or beer.
4368,Bard's Gold,4.42,i recently tasted bard\s gold a lager. i\m an avid beer drinker and have been trying to reduce the amount of gluten in my diet so i did a taste test of all the gluten-free beers on the market. bards was the best of the lot. it is important to note that many of the competitors in the gluten free space are not truly gluten-free...they have warning labels that say they have been brewed to remove gluten...after a bit of research it appears that these beers use an enzyme to break down the gluten protein so the gluten can\t be found in a test...but the gluten parts are still in the beer. i don\t fully understand the science but if there are parts of gluten present it seems like misrepresented marketing to me??? bards is made with malted sorghum (which doesn\t contain gluten) and not wheat or barley (which contain gluten) like many beers. looks like ab has a gluten-free sorghum beer too but it is made with a syrup and not the malted grain...we all know how important malting is to the beer\s taste!  my body feels so much healthier as i eliminate and reduce the gluten in my diet and am glad that i found bards. im looking forward to drinking more bards in the near future!
4369,Bard's Gold,4.06,bards gold | bards tale beer company. poured from the bottle into a pint glass this beer has a two finger thick head with spotty lacing and a goldish/copper body.  smells like hearty grains actually.  it has a decent lager flavor but i can tell something is missing.  the mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation.  overall ill rate bards gold | bards tale beer company with a solid 4.
4370,Bard's Gold,1.48,this beer has a funky taste to it its bland and what flavor is there isnt very enjoyable. theres better gluten-free beers out there than this stuff.
4371,Bard's Gold,4.08,bards gold brewed by bards tale beer company with an abv of 4.60% this brew brew pours out a nice brown color with a small white head. the head to this brew is small and goes away fast. i really like the color of this brew . the smell of bards gold is rich with sweetness. you pick up on roasted grians and malts. there is also a hit of hops in the smell of this brew. the smell of this brew is really inviting. now for the taste it is nice with flavors and sweetness. there are mild notes of grins and malts. i really like how smooth this brew goes down. now  bards gold  has a real nice balance to it there is nothing overpowering about this brew. i like how this brew ends with the sweetness. this is a fine drinking brew. the mouthfeel of bards gold is rich clean smooth and refreshing. i cant get over how smooth this brew is. overall im going bards gold a 4 out of 5. i thought this brew would be a bit more bolder however it is a nice drinking brew. i would buy this brew again. bards tale beer company did a nice job with this one.
4372,Stone IPA,4.16,this is my go-to ipa. it has a nice strong bitterness with a good warming resin and malty flavor there is a nice lemon note in taste and smell throughout. i can take this in the can or pour in a glass. main reason its my go-to is it packs a nice punch for a nice price.
4373,Stone IPA,4.18,this classic american ipa starts with bready malt and a restrained note of stone fruit then finishes with decisive bitterness. an ultra classic rarely improved upon. for a more adventurous brew ska’s modus hoperandi takes this concept further into parts unknown. for perfection bell’s two hearted ale leans in the direction of drinkability.
4374,Stone IPA,3.87,plenty of bitter-acrid hops. lovely pine-y complexity with the hops here. this is not a beer that is going for balance. primarily bitter. of course its much better than your average beer - but its not my favorite ipa.
4375,Stone IPA,5,this is the best beer ever. the quintessential so-cal ipa. phenomenal. perfect in every way.
4376,Stone IPA,4.39,look - golden clear solid white head lacing was minimal smell - piney citrus lemon peel taste - piney resinous citrus lemon peel feel - medium body moderate carbonation piney resin bitterness lingers overall - ive had this many times and its still a damn good beer. if you love west coast ipas then youll love this one too. pine resin citrus lemon peel and good bitterness that lingers. this is the brew that put stone on the map and kept them there for good reason. the bitterness was hitting so good tonight so i paired her up with stone cold crazy by queen.
4377,Stone IPA,4.59,look- liquid gold smell- strong piney resin and lemony zest taste- pine resin lemon and bitters with very tame and subtle malt feel- crispy and refreshing overall- one of the most refreshing bitter-hoppy and satisfying ipas on the easily accessible market
4378,Stone IPA,4.13,solid ipa. tame and restrained compared to most current hop offerings but remember this is like rating your middle school girlfriend while you have been kicking it at studio 54 for a few months. everything is well done but tamped down which is understandable. brown pine straw wheat bread and a little corn sweetness. sul ross ms. 1985. pour one out for ray-dog. oh-duh-lay.
4379,Stone IPA,4.1,pours clear dark amber gold. notes of citrus and hoppy goodness. taste follows with a smooth feel. nice fresh aftertaste. not acrid at all. really good.
4380,Stone IPA,4.22,poured from a 12 ounce can into a teku glass.  look- deep gold very hazy visible small particulate cream colored very frothy head above average head retention and lacing.  smell- clementine pine resin lemon zest between medium and high strength of scent.  taste- clementine pine resin pineapple lemon zest medium strength of flavor.  feel- medium body average carbonation high bitterness highly creamy mildly dry finish.  overall- deep gold and very hazy with above average head retention and lacing. bouquet was clementine pine resin and lemon zest. flavor was similar to the nose with some notes of pineapple. the feel was medium body with high bitterness and creaminess. overall this was a very nice example of a west coast ipa that provided a nice drinking experience.
4381,Stone IPA,3.42,mediocre.
4382,Stone IPA,4.05,chill haze orange gold body with a sticky white head. nose is orange and grapefruit pith and zest some fresh pine needles and a hint of spice. theres a bit of a sweet malt backbone to the beer that wasnt obvious to me in the nose. it seems a bit more than i recall from having this over the years but the can has a date that puts it at a month old so its not that. the citrus note melds into the malt weakening its pop compared to the nose. pine comes through with a little more power to make up for that although it isnt as fresh - more like the pine needles have fallen to the forest floor. still a solid ipa but it isnt as brash as i thought it once was.
4383,Skol Beer,4,i am trying to get myself as close to a milestone before tomorrow evening as possible so i am running through as much of the backlog to position myself to be able to meet it as possible. as such the canquest (tm) is going to be hitting some oddballs.  from the can: european brewing tradition * premium quality beer; imported; \one of the top 5 selling beers in the world\ source: canadean.  i kind of liked that this is a simple epl. it gave me the chance to simply canduct a quick & simple crack! & glug resulting in the formation of just under two fingers of dense foamy rocky bone-white head with admirable retention in the face of tonights heat & humidity. color was yellow-gold (srm = 4 - 5) with ne-quality clarity bringing the gelt gang of midas mammon & croesus in from the living room where they were watching tonights pgh pirates (black & gold) game on teevee. nose was malty sweet but very clean & quite simply a lager. i prefer this style over aals any day of the week at any time. mouthfeel was medium big for the style. the taste was quite malty & sweet more bready than malty but still a refreshing drink on a hot humid summers night. i have baseball on the telly & this would be a welcome alternative to drinking an aal at the ballpark. finish was semi-sweet just sweet enough for my taste. this was not a bad beer. ymmv.
4384,Skol Beer,2.18,got this in malaysia. 320ml can poured into a pint glass.  l: clear gold in color with decent white head and average retention there is some lacing left behind.  s: metallic sulfur grain dms grass.  t: metallic sulfur grain dms grass a bit yeasty sour quite insipid.  f+o: light body moderate crisp and carbonation not that smooth semi-dry finish. better no repeat.
4385,Skol Beer,1.69,320ml can from 7-eleven in malaysia (rm7.50): light and incredibly clear golden straw coloured with a thin half centimetre head that is bubbly but at least it manages to hold for a little while barely budging at all over the first few minutes.  sweet with a lot of corn and grain plus a little bit of alcohol and plenty of skunk coming through. there is a sort of metallic smell initially as well but the beer smells quite cheap on the nose.  bland tasting at first with a sort of sweet carbonated water taste and some mild bitterness and some skunky flavours as well. there is some faint grassy hops and a little corn with some cheap lager malts as well.  grainy & light bodied with a skunky flavour throughout but nothing overpowering at least. there is a clean but very bland mouthfeel and the finish has touches of bitterness and is dry too.  a very poor effort and if im honest it was pretty much what i had been expecting from this one. not one i can recommend and i cant imagine the beer is any good no matter where it is brewed around the world.
4386,Pliny The Younger,5,perfect. boozy be careful
4387,Pliny The Younger,4.86,ive been chasing this beer for the better part of 13 years. today was finally the day. 500ml capped bottle into a fuzzy ipa glass.  pours crystal clear goldenrod with a slowly building 2 finger foamy white head that sits around. patchy stringy lace sticks to the inside of the glass. nose is citrus pine grass and sap. fresh aggressive resiny. very pungent. beer opens grass pine and citrus. zesty towards the middle with loads of fresh pine unripened tropical fruit and tree sap. finishes with a crystal clean bitterness that is dry and lingers in the aftertaste. body is light to medium with ample carbonation. prickly and lively on the palate and goes down dry with a lingering sticky aftertaste.  i may be buying into the hype a bit after all this time but in a category that everyone in the world tries to do 10 times over this is somehow the best of the bunch. a near perfect beer in every way. this juice is worth the squeeze.
4388,Pliny The Younger,4.68,bucket list beer. pretty darn good.
4389,Pliny The Younger,4.88,fantastic beer. very light and golden in color. very little head on it. much better than pliny the elder. there’s a very subtle fruitiness to it and it goes down very easily
4390,Pliny The Younger,5,quite literally the nectar of the gods
4391,Pliny The Younger,5,on tap at finleys pub in denver. absolutely delicious !!
4392,Pliny The Younger,4.5,poured from a 17.2oz bottle into a snifter at home. thanks darin for the share. i love the pine in this.
4393,Pliny The Younger,4.99,good god man! holy shit this is a really good beer. having been blessed with national travel for work and fly fishing trips - and the expendable budget to have had the opportunity to try many of the top beers on beer advocate and those celebrated by fellow beer lovers. i’ve had many many ipas from vermont to colorado and new york to california - but my brother and his gang of beer connoisseurs demanded that i join them in boulder colorado for the tapping of a 2023 pliny the younger at the annual celebration at backcountry pizza & taphouse… and i couldn’t be more delighted that they did - might be best beer that have ever crossed this unrefined pallet. perfect all around and holy shit drinkable …
4394,Budweiser Select,4.05,(shaker pint in the biergarten at the st. louis brewery)  decent for a light lager. cant tell its low carb or any different than their other light lagers. it seems to have that slightly doughy flavor that i find present in busch. never seen this in my market and why would i?... slight dried flower grain grassy scent... certainly not dull for what it is. (2167)
4395,Budweiser Select,5,it\s not perfect but for a light beer at 4.3abv it is not bad. rated it a 5 because budweiser select in my opinion is the best light beer available and it should not be rated awful.
4396,Budweiser Select,1.98,i guess its beer.
4397,Budweiser Select,3.06,poured from a 12oz can best by september 9th 2023  on the pour a finger of sudsy verging on fizzy head formed with surprisingly decent retention. head settles at a fine but thin covering. body is highly carbonated and a clear golden yellow.  aroma is very close to bisch light but perhaps slightly more substantial. theres definitely corn in this beer. cheap macro smell but not the worst.  taste follows the aroma. slightly fuller busch light. decent doughy grainy thing and it doesnt taste too watered down.  feel is surprisingly full drinkable and refreshing but not heavy. this is actually a smooth macro lager.  overall this was impressive. in my opinion better than bud heavy and maybe even mhl.
4398,Budweiser Select,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included.
4399,Budweiser Select,3,of all the low calorie low carb beers i’ll take this over to others
4400,Budweiser Select,1.7,pours a very pale yellow color with a very small white head. it has the taste of a beer .. sort of .. when you drink one ice cold and are dying of thirst. havent had one in years and now i remember why. blah.
4401,Budweiser Select,3.5,this is my favorite backyard all-nighter beer. in my fridge you find 3 types of beer: a stout buy-of-the-week miller lite budweiser select. love budweiser select cant complain. full of memories of the good ole college years where we all chip in to buy a 24-pk or two.
4402,Budweiser Select,4.27,one of the better light macro beers out there - itll never compare to the craft beer but its excellent for what it is. great lawn mowing / fishing / golfing beer on a hot day.
4403,Saison Du Fermier,4.18,tart light refreshing nuanced acidic and dry. taste is grape oak barnyard funk and lemon zest.
4404,Saison Du Fermier,4.65,blend #6.  tart musty peaches and lemon zest on the nose. palate with a restrained acid and pleasant pucker bringing mild oaky funk & bright citrus. finishes dry yet juicy with a lingering tartness. such a good blend.
4405,Delirium Tremens,4.09,an absolute classic for a reason. ive always noticed a bit of cherry and a lot of clove in this beer and its not as bitter as duvel. this one needs to be served at cellar temp and not cold in my experience. it makes a big difference in picking out the nuances of the yeast strain. an all-time favorite for me.
4406,Delirium Tremens,3.5,i had this on draft 9/12/23.  semi-opaque dull yellow/orange appearance.  huge eggshell-colored head; strong tree-rung lacing remained.  bubblegum & soft wheat notes in the nose.  soft medium mouthfeel.  bubblegum & soft wheat flavors.  drinkable and itll do in a pinch but this classic just isnt for me.
4407,Delirium Tremens,4.03,11.2 oz bottle acclimated to 56°f and poured into a goblet.  pours a rich amber/honey gold with a long lasting 1 finger foamy white head leaving a think ring of lacing.  initial aroma is clean fruit esters (my brain is saying pear and pineapple but its very faint and im not sure) with a somewhat sterile clear alcohol smell. additionally a pepperiness a light fresh light green grassiness and a light white floral note can be found. maybe damp hay? i guess thats probably the yeast. after agitating i notice the alcohol comes forward and a clean and pale maltiness can be found.  initially before swallowing i get a peppery tingling may be due to the alcohol theres also a sweet vague fruitiness.  after swallowing im hit with alcohol upfront stays at the back corners of the roof and bottom of the mouth and top of the front half and tip of the tongue and reminds me of a fruity brandy im getting specifically pear. i get a malty note i can best describe as damp hay just like i smelled. the pepperiness i smelled is there too it seems almost paired up with a dry somewhat bitter grassiness which differs from the grassiness i smelled. a note of dry white wine reveals itself to me upon getting further in and is now present throughout the whole process. the aftertaste comprises dryness alcohol burn (which fades) fruity fumes and that dry white wine taste.  feel is very smooth with almost a chew to it. fuller body than average genuinely almost a little syrupy. additionally the carbonation persists meaning that i can truly enjoy this one slowly which is how i drink beer.  overall it excels. the flavors pair with each other exceedingly well and it exhibits a top display of coherence in beer. the only thing i can think of that i would prefer is a lower abv i generally quite enjoy high (and quite high) abv beers but the alcohol burn in this one is reminiscent of a brandy or other spirit and its harsh to my tastes. still this beer could be renamed delirium tremendous.  will absolutely buy again at some point though not often. thats on me though i love love love belgian dark ales but belgian pales are not my absolute favorite. otherwise it would be a common purchase. will be recommending to people for sure.
4408,Delirium Tremens,4.03,appearance: pours a nearly completely clear (90% clarity) light golden color with a massive white head that lingers. srm of 7. (4.00)  aroma: strong aromas of belgian bread spice cloves yeast and bread malts. faint citrus and flower underneath. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of belgian bread spice flower yeast upfront. it then evolves and shows the alcohol for only a bit before a rich smooth and sweet bread malt comes through with some sweet citrus and alcohol warmth to back it up. finish is smooth bready and sweet. (4.00)  feel: medium bodied strong carbonation. creamy smooth shows the alcohol warmth and sweet. (4.25)  overall: not my favorite style in a belgian strong as sometimes too heavy and boozy but this is a good one. probably the best ive had. still rich and boozy but also great belgian bread spice and sweet citrus flavors with a decently clean mouthfeel. i usually prefer a saison or tripel with stronger yeast and spices. for a belgian strong this is authentic and excellent. (rating: 4.03)
4409,Delirium Tremens,5,i have tried to beer from tap from the delirium tremens brewery and from the can and the bottle all of them we’re perfectly balanced strong ale with a nice sweet candy flavor finish looks clear and smells like sugar definitely a great beer
4410,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.94,welcome to a winter ipa. this is a dark amber colored robust hoppy ipa. its feels dense and well carbonated. you can taste the hops all through the beer. i would recommend this to anyone who is an ipa lover.
4411,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.3,poured into a goblet: color is amber transparent head is off white and presents 1 finger thick dissipates to a solid top some lacing and streaking on the glass sides.  smell is big bitter slightly biting - notes of pine earth citrus juniper some honey and syrupy notes light caramel.  taste is similar with big bitter notes of hops and alcohol - pine earth citrus honey syrup light toast and caramel some tonicy/herbaly/juniper notes.  mouthfeel is moderate carbonation moderate sweetness strong bitterness and slight boozy burn.  overall - amazed that big big non-hazy ipas are this hard to find - so much more nuance flavor and drinkability.
4412,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.82,poured from a 12 oz. can. has a burnt orange color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of caramel malts pine. taste is a pine forest a strong malt backbone some alcohol significant bitterness. feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer.
4413,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.05,6 oz pour on tap at lures bar & grille. pours a clear caramel color (lighter than a brown ale) with a small head. aroma and flavor feature dank pine grapefruit rind caramel malt sticky resin and moderate booziness. bitterness is offset by malty sweetness. mouthfeel is full and moderately carbonated. overall its a nice throwback dipa but doesnt blow me away.
4414,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.33,(12 oz can ejby 08/13/22; purchased cold single at shangys last week... poured into a fat tulip)  l: clear tawny-colored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze; cratery exploded foam sponge upon pour collapsing quick into a thick gummy collar... two droopy eyebrows of lace  s: semi-characteristically stone melange of piney outdoorsy juice nectary hops along with a cane-sugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident tonic ethanol kick... upon further sniffage an herbal cannabis overtone all day... supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers  t: bitter-herbal pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy booze-shocked essences... the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top even cutting through to the sinuses... its almost like a malort and cointreau-infused strong amber ale  f: resinous silken near cordial glory lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent... its glassy ghostly undercurrent is perhaps (along with its hot sauce fire) its most striking characteristic as it seems to just float in the ether  o: for all its brashness quintessentially stone in its relentless (to me fantastic) bitterness it sports jagged facets of two-dimensional static obscure muddy expressions... im somewhat enjoying this but craving something more characterful though its tactile sensations are leaving me perplexed and intrigued (1970)
4415,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.85,deep gold with decent head. it smells like alcohol and piney hops. taste is bitter a little hot some malt  herbal piney with some fruit flavor poking through. pretty strong and a little rough around the edges but not unbalanced and fairly easy to drink despite its profile. it reminds me of the original hoptimum a little. not a bad strong ale but i’ll file this in the been there done that and move on to other things cheers!
4416,RuinTen Triple IPA,2.89,disappointingly long lasting bitter after taste with no sweetness at all - unusual for double digit abv. reminds me a little of scotch ales with a strong dark almost metallic mouth feel followed by the bitterness. a strong beer that unfortunately did not get better with a second can. i like stone beers but this i wont buy again
4417,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.76,canned april 15th enjoy by august 13th 2022.  pours a clear gold not much to talk aboot in the foam department.  smells extremely hoppy but with a big malty bite. citrus some pine leans into some tropical fruit but not hugely.  huge citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge call it in balance i reckon. alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with. a little bit spicy earthy vegetal short sips are best for me.  sticky somewhat juicy mouthfeel.  kind of wearing on the palate but i enjoy it.
4418,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.7,definitely awesome nose and color just has a bit of too much alcohol after taste to it at the end and bitterness lasts for ever
4419,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.31,so cool they decided to brew this beer again.  look: old gold body nice off-white head.  smell: pine floral notes orange peel  taste: intense grapefruit hops--almost abrasive (in a good way!). some sweet toffee malts mid-palate fresh squeezed orange juice too. clean citrus-lemon finish with slightest white pepper alcohol note/burn. wow.  feel: very big beer fuller medium to full bodied ipa.  overall: this beer would be awesome to pair with food. doesnt make sense to have more than one of these imo but this is an awesome west coast ipa. the kind of ipa that got me into craft beer in the first place--very nostalgic and fun to try. and a pretty reasonable price point to boot. if i can find another fresh batch im definitely trying this again.
4420,Cable Car,4.55,2020 vintage.  clear golden coloration; soft white head of carbonation settles in a thin ring around the beer.  the nose opens with a musty sweetness and candied lemon peel. really nice balance of funk and citrus.  the palate is tart and predominantly fruity with a bit of a tightening pucker on the back of the palate and a long mildly acidic finish. nice juiciness to the overall profile.  a touch of dryness with a soft finish and gentle lingering tannin.
4421,Cable Car,4.53,2019 version drank 06.19.22 out of a hill farmstead bulbous wine glass. straw color with very delicate islands of head but other than that not to much there. not too much nose either. funky and acidy taste strong. very pungent strong and tasty. pretty amazing beer. just wow.
4422,Yeti,4.27,poured from a 12oz can. almost black liquid with a light brown head. sticky foam fingers coat the glass walls from top to bottom as you drink. smell and taste of dark chocolate and coffee. im a big fan of most yetis and this one didnt disappoint. not my most favorite but damn good.
4423,Yeti,4.44,i am putting this beer up with narwhal as a go to imperial stout. surprised i had not reviewed previously. a bargain as well six pack for about $15.  poured from a can into a tulip glass. oily deep dark brown color with an exquisite light brown creamy foamy head and excellent curtain lacing. smell and taste of dark chocolate sweet plums and cinnamon. some smokey malt and vanilla. silky smooth feel. i understand why this beer is a craft classic!
4424,Yeti,4.29,black and impenetrable to light. there’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top. heavy soapy lacing. there’s plenty of dark lightly roasted lightly smoky and a touch chocolatey malt. i’m tasting roasted barley and dark chocolate. the mouth is thick and sticky.
4425,Yeti,4.27,opaque black color with some ruby highlights and a massive milk chocolate colored head with some nice lacing. the aroma is dark roast malt caramel toffee espresso and hints of dark chocolate. the taste is dark sweet malt up front followed quickly by the bite of dark coffee dark chocolate and a blast of herbal hops. this is almost taste overload massive malt sweetness backed up with serious bitterness from both the roasted malt and major hops. the body is full good level of carbonation still smooth and drinkable but best for sipping after dinner or anytime you can just relax and enjoy something really appropriate to the name.
4426,Yeti,4.51,the roastiest (?) stout i’ve ever tried. sweetness up front gives way to awesome bitterness! smells of nice bitter chocolate that definitely carrie’s over to the taste. i will definitely be searching this out again!
4427,Yeti,4.4,poured from a 12oz can. the color is pitch black. moderate foamy tan head. mild hop aroma with coffee hints. flavor is quite hoppy. reminds me of victory’s “storm king “. nice dark chocolate flavor. dry finish and thick mouthfeel. i’m glad i finally got around to trying this!
4428,Yeti,4.37,pint can poured into an avery snifter. pours a deep brown with a fine tan head that lingers. aroma is dark roast malt french roast coffee cacao powder. taste follows; chocolate dark coffee and a killer late hop bite. full bodied low to medium carbonation. overall one of my personal favorite american stouts. well crafted travels well.
4429,Yeti,4.9,great flavor (not too bitter or too sweet) and mouth feel.
4430,Yeti,4.39,strong almost expresso bean flavor followed by dark / slightly bitter (bakers) chocolate. mouth feel is pretty good a little syrupy compared to north coast old rasputin - but the flavor is very similar. a bit of alcohol on the aftertaste that quicky gets overpowered by the coffee / chocolate flavor. very solid imperial stout one of the best ones ive tried and ive tried a ton of them.
4431,Yeti,3.87,12oz can poured into a teku glass. look is nearly black with one finger of brown head. retention is average leaving an island and collar. smell is medium in strength. i smell caramel semisweet chocolate a little ash or pipe tobacco and a light spicy hop smell. taste is medium-high in strength. i taste caramel dark roasted coffee a little semisweet chocolate a little ash and a long spicy medium-high bitter hop finish. feel is just below medium-high in thickness. its a little creamy. carbonation is low. astringency is just below medium. its quite dry. overall its a very good beer. the mouth feel is a bit disappointing.
4432,Yeti,4.13,poured from a 12 oz can dated 6/07/2022 into a snifter glass. l - pours a dark brown with a medium tan head that dissipates slowly. s - smells of cocoa and coffee. t - taste matches the smell lot’s of baker’s chocolate and coffee. f - full bodied and carbonation on the lighter side. o - for an abv of 9.5 % the booze is hidden well. very tasty stout.
4433,Storm King,4.47,poured from 12-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. pours black as a moonless night with a thick foamy tan head that showed great retention and beautiful sheets of lacing as it receded. lightly herbaceous aroma and lots of hoppy bitterness up front. aromas and flavors of roasted malt espresso bean dark chocolate and char. satisfying mouthfeel with a mostly dry finish and lots of char lingering on the palate. the alcohol is well hidden among the bold characteristics of this beer. delicious and highly recommended
4434,Storm King,4.05,12 oz botle into a snifter. pours midnight black tan foam good lacing. smell is deep dark cacao dark toast malt cuban coffee almost burnt malt. taste goes dark chocolate rich espresso a fine bold hop zing on the side of the tongue that’s unexpected. feel is medium carb medium body medium slick. not syrupy at all. overall this is a good little stout with no barrel required.
4435,Storm King,3.96,i’m really late to the game on grading this!  l- pitch black color.  s- roasted dark malt. slight smoky smell.  t- dark chocolate almost cocoa flavor.  f- decent mouthfeel.  o- great unadulterated imperial stout!
4436,Storm King,4.44,poured this into a glass. poured out a ritch and dark black with a hop malt and slight chocolatey smell. the taste was different to me since this is my introduction to this type of beer and it wasnt quite what i was expecting. the abv (9.1%) is apparent and the added hop flavor is just right. i like it and will be having it again for sure.
4437,Storm King,4.16,poured from a botle dated bb 10/22/22 into the test glass a - solid black color excellent tan tight knit froth lacing with each draw. s - bakers chocoalte char a bit of espresso pine. t - again with the bakers chocolate add a hint of orange rime and piney coffee with flourless chocoalate cake. m - medium in body start is semi sweet then rolls toward and stays on the bitter side. finish is ashen dry. o - a new favorite for me assertive edgy and with all the pieces of an american ris. thankful to have this in our area.
4438,Storm King,4,pours dark. tan foam. malty aroma. big hop body. fades to a malty goodness. bitter finish. im surprised how hoppy it is. good balance of malt and hops. this ones a classic.
4439,Storm King,3.86,look: pours like black coffee with a nice tan head with great retention. sticky foam lace on the glass. taste and smell: strong espresso notes with a hint of chocolate. somewhat bitter. feel: a full mouth oiliness going on. overall: pretty good coffee imperial shout.
4440,Storm King,4.02,from the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. this classic pours a dark blackish brown with a fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick fat layer with excellent lacing. nose of dark cocoa pine touched hops dark coffee and moderate char. flavors follow the nose nicely with dark bakers cocoa char coffee and floral as well as pine touched hops on the rear. nice mouth feel; medium full body smooth lightly creamy and finishing with a char and bitter malt note balanced by strong hops.  overall a solid brew a touch more hops than i remember but solid all the same!  cheers
4441,Storm King,3.94,victory storm king is a well balanced stout with elements of malt roasted malt and hoppy bitterness. the 9.1% alcohol content is well hidden. the flavor is more assertive than a guinness stout nitro. i recently tasted a carlow ohara stout that was more aggressively flavored than storm king even having half the alcohol content. all things being equal id prefer to drink two of the oharas than just one storm king.
4442,Storm King,3.89,pours an opaque deep dark black with a creamy/foamy mocha colored head. deep roasted nuttinessalmost peanut butter scent taste is smoky coffeeespresso even more. dark chocolate.feels full bodied with enough carbonation.finishes dank and chewy- overall this is a stout that lets you know its a stout an above average hop presence.
4443,Storm King,4.37,label says best by oct 22 2022. interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age. reviews ive read lead me to expect something different in the nose but the sweet dark candy smell betrays nothing about this being any different from any other impy stout. the opaque blackness topped with a thin offwhite foam also seem normal. the only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops which only appear to me in the taste rather than in the smell. its noticably drier than id expect and the alcohol is well hidden. hops dominate later in the taste. its a nice change but to me a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. the mouthfeel is light but chewy. overall very nice and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout.
4444,Storm King,4.29,l- jet black tan head with moderate lacing  s- herbal hops up front with a sweet roasted malt and vanilla back drop  t- strong citrus and herbal hoppy flavors with some chocolate and char. moderate to strong bitter.  t- medium body medium carbonation.  o- well balanced very good beer. i would almost consider this a black ipa though
4445,Storm King,4.13,pours black with a nice light brown head. not much retention but a nice thin layer of creamy light brown persists.  citrus hops dark chocolate dark fruit and dark roast black coffee.  very much similar to the nose the hops really show a grapefruit citrus without any of the sweet. the coffee also really shows on the finish.  full body moderate to low carbonation a hint of alcohol nice big bitterness.
4446,Storm King,4.1,pours a near black color with a small short-lived tan head and light lacing.  smells and tastes of toasted malt and coffee. sips are lightly bitter from start to finish.  medium body with light carbonation. clean dry mouthfeel.  this is a good imperial stout that probably would mellow well with some age.
4447,Storm King,4.42,12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. looks dark brown to black with a khaki head that falls off to a thin cap. smell is a nice mix of dark malt roasted coffee cocoa and a bit of bright floral hops. taste starts with roast malt a bit of fruit (raspberry) hops. in the middle i get some bitterness from the hops more fruit and a cocoa powder flavor. finish is hoppy cocoa powder and coffee. very balanced between sweet and bitter. mouth feel is medium-full rather soft and creamy even with a tight carbonation present. the alcohol is hidden pretty well. overall im glad they brought this back. for some reason i always passed this one up years ago. this is a great stout and a nice change of pace from the barrel aged and super sweet stouts that dominate.
4448,Sapporo Premium Beer,4.04,having this because i made some karaage and i wanted to go with a japanese rice lager for the vibes but given how theyve handled the anchor acquisition and now shutdown the vibes are pretty meh. that is all to say this was the only japanese lager available at my local packie. pours a pale golden. its light and provides a good compliment to the heaviness of the fried chicken. i like japanese rice lagers and i cant fault this one. its like floral basmati rice with some gentle floral hop character. its got a purpose and it fulfills it.
4449,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.25,had sapporo premium beer poured from heavy tapered 22-oz. can brewed and canned in vietnam bottom obscurely stamped c1023h and 0228fl into pilsner glass.  pours light-gold with clarity and 2-finger near-white head with decent retention leaving some sketchy belgian lace down the glass. lots of sweet mild malt and some mild hop spice aromas off pour with the latter gone so quickly i may have imagined it and the sweet malt aroma continuing but fading into a little earthy funk and as warms a hint of tart stone fruit and that coy hop spice. on tasting begins sweet mild malt which continues until interrupted by a hint of earthy funk before a very drying slightly noble hop bitter and spicy disappearing rather than crisp finish.  okay so it’s not great beer but theres nothing actually wrong with it and a big can of bone dry sapporo is excellent for washing down repeated trips to your local asian buffet.
4450,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.4,poured from a dark bottle pours a dark gold colour with no head. smell is almost non-existent taste is a watery lager. even though it came from a bottle i taste some metallic initially fading into a watery thin taste of...not much.
4451,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.46,12 ounce bottle poured into a tumbler.  l: clear pale/straw moderate white head fairly thick foam. s: very weak malty aroma. t: malty bread grain floral hop finish semi-dry mild bitterness. f; medium-weight smooth body slightly crisp edges. o: decent lager.
4452,Sapporo Premium Beer,4.16,had this in the past but never reviewed. much better than i remember. extremely smooth feel with high-drinkability no real criticisms aside perhaps from maybe missing a bit more character in the malt profile.
4453,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.24,12oz can. brewed in guelph on canada. can bottom is stamped l3022g 1956fl. clear pale gold colored body. one thinner finger of white head which persists later as an interrupted cap. leaves behind some thin threads of lacing. aroma of toasted grains honey and green grape. taste is sweet fruity and floral. toasted grains prevail. spicy note. medium mouth feel. dry and crisp finish. very good carbonation. unobtrusive with a thinness of expression. good for social hour.
4454,Traditional Lager,3.75,we in the big leagues son. raul up and in the southwest like the maids cleaning up at truly best. drinking this syrup on the way to europe! and you know what? it good! awooooo like a wolf going through puberty.  letsssssss gooooooooo!
4455,Traditional Lager,4.77,go to inexpensive us beer . waiting for it to come to canada or even vermont .
4456,Traditional Lager,3.06,perfectly drinkable lager great for the price and for sessions.
4457,Traditional Lager,3.27,i had this first at a wedding and it\s exactly that a fine wedding beer. looks great in a glass or bottle tastes malty with a barely existing note of hop... i get this fizzy feeling on my tongue. a perfectly fine choice at an event.
4458,Traditional Lager,3.32,this is a very serviceable lager. though technically not a macro or aal i put it in the same category and it is my favorite of the group. in a cooler full of aals at a party im going with this one every time. the main drawback for me is that i get almost no aroma which is unfortunate.  i find that there can be some variability. sometimes a get nice caramel honey on dark bread. other times the caramel seems more syrupy. either way for the price and purpose this will do just fine.
4459,Traditional Lager,4.44,this is my go to beer when i am out at a restaurant or i am hosting a backyard bbq. 9 times out of 10 this beer will not let you down. it tastes great is thirst quenching drinks very easily and you can have several in a day and not really get hammered. my only issue is that when drunk from a bottle i have definitely encountered entire 6 packs that are off and skunky. on tap and from cans are definitely better options as i fear that the green glass bottles lend themselves to sun damage. yuengling traditional lager is going to always be a yes from me.
4460,Traditional Lager,3.8,not all beer serves the same purpose. not all beer needs to elicit rave reviews when sipped thoughtfully from a glass in isolation. this is a working beer. enjoy it after an evening of mowing the grass in the summer heat. gulp it down in between bites of yakitori hot off a charcoal fire. drink it straight from the bottle.  this is the only macro brew ive always come back to.
4461,Traditional Lager,3.43,this is one of the best mass produced beers. it has a clear amber color with medium to light carbonation and a slightly sweet and malty aftertaste. a little more hops would balance the taste and greatly improve it overall. at 4.5 abv you can enjoy quite a few without adverse effects the next day.
4462,Prior 8,3.98,good initial off-white head when poured from the bottle and nice lacing throughout. body is an opaque red-brown.  aroma is a sweet malt with a dried fruit (fig raisin) presence. pleasant.  taste follows nose and the malt more fully expresses itself. dark fruit returns and is complimented by yeast notes and a bit of light spice. the finish reveals a modest hop taste then dries up.  good strong carbonation and the mouthfeel is moderate. drinks lighter than its abv. no hint of the alcohol.
4463,Prior 8,4.17,for a double it was good not outstanding...
4464,Prior 8,4.22,750ml bottle into a brugges glass. freshness dating minuscule.  looks fantastic. dark reddish brown body thick foamy off white head retains well and leaves tons of lacing.  clean malty aroma.  so easy drinking. clean smooth sweet with some dark fruit notes.  mouth between medium and full finish somewhat sweet.  overall a delightful drink. dubbels arent usually my thing but this is an excellent drink.
4465,Prior 8,4.5,cloudy reddish brown big khaki head excellent retention and bands of lace warm spices dried fruit rum cake aroma quatre epices rum-soaked fruit cake a bit earthier than the pater or abt in flavor medium bodied and well carbonated this is excellent but i like the pater better.
4466,Prior 8,4.22,l: huge 3 finger frothy head on top of a dark brown body. s: sweet. plum cherry raisin mild spices caramelized fruit dough chocolate. t: caramelized fruit upfront molasses plum raisin pie cherries slightly bitter hops behind all of this yeastiness that i can’t really describe a hint of apple and chocolate on the finish. f: high carbonation slight froth in the mouth fairly well masked alcohol. o: expected the body to be sweeter but not at all disappointed. none of the cloying fruit syrupiness that some dubbels have. all the flavors flow together quite nicely. worth the price.
4467,Prior 8,4.39,bottle from john’s poured into rochefort tulip. quintessential dubbel.
4468,Prior 8,4.71,my favorite belgian dubbel so far. beautiful in every way. i love the way the finish stays with you long after the last sip. pretty near perfect for me.
4469,Trappist Tripel,4.46,unfiltered golden color with fruity aroma and taste. dangerously easy to drink at 9%.
4470,Trappist Tripel,4.38,a: burn copper color with some definite chill haze going on. a touch of yellow towards the bottom and a really nice 2-3 finger solid off-white head that looks like a coin could rest on it  s: green apples banana and clove upfront. cardamom pepper and green pears behind that. some grassy grains and malt sweetness as well as some lemongrass and sharp sweet citrus. amazing aroma  t: loads of banana and cardamom upfront. sweet pears and green apple skin along with some pepper spice and sweet grassy grains. a hint of alcohol sharpness is here but well-hidden. faint clove an coriander in the background as well  m: medium-heavy mouthfeel with strong carbonation  o: fantastic beer and what i think one of the benchmarks for the style should be. complex yet drinkable and dangerous
4471,Trappist Tripel,3.84,11.2 fl oz. bottle bottled jan 06 2022 best by jan 06 2024 were about right in the middle plus a few months. excited to finally be trying the world renowed trappist tripel by westmalle. acquired at the local binnys ive had this sitting in the fridge for a couple of months..  poured to piraat stemware. a: pours a nicely crisp golden body deep in color rich looking. pillowy finger point five of creamy white frothy head. good thick ribbons of lacing. looks excellent for sure. s: good creamy aroma. notes of orchard fruits apples pears leaves. t: taste follows lots of crisp orchard fruits green apple pear. cidery with a hot alcoholic bite at the end. f: feel is a bit thick & heavy. well-carbonated but definitely a beer you will want to sip slowly. alcohol content is hot & boozy reminiscent of nail polish remover / booze fumes. overall it was fun to try and im definitely interested in trying more authentic trappist made ales but tripels are typically not my thing to begin with. the quality of the ingredients shows but the booziness killed it for me.  westmalle trappist tripel -----3.75/5
4472,Trappist Tripel,4.23,pours cloudy honey yellow with an enormous white head that leaves generous lacing. aroma is caramel malt banana yeast and pepper. flavor follows the nose magically. feel is light and well carbonated. overall fantastic.
4473,Trappist Tripel,4.61,ive had westmalle blonde before and enjoyed it but the tripel knocks it out of the park. pours beautifully with a long lasting three finger head. dreamy floral notes honey sweetness and lovely to see the little clouds of yeast floating in the straw-gold haze. surprising. delicious. one to remember.
4474,Trappist Tripel,4.1,1cl taster at the zythos festival in kortrijk. this is a very good tripel. to add there are many good tripels along with many other styles.
4475,Autumna,4.46,mostly clear and quite pale gold with a dense and creamy white head retaining wildly thick while leaving defined layers of lace after each sip.  through the head of cloudy fluff lies an uncannily delicate lager thats perhaps a little more florally bitter and dry than i expected possibly from the oak and a touch of fine minerality though i now realize its a festbier. an even more delicate and subtle presence of malt like white corn or wheat imparts a very pale quality in the background.  the medium body has a fine carbonation and finishes bone dry.
4476,Autumna,4.39,growler from the source. basically the same as poetica for me -- which means i was a big fan. gotta love hfs dedication to the craft. the closest you can get to the real deal this side of the atlantic  88/100
4477,Autumna,4.32,growler filled at brewery on 9/30/22; consumed on 10/6/22  pours a crystal-clear vibrant straw-gold body capped with two fingers of delicate yet firm white foam; great head retention yields a finger and a half of near-creamy cap moderate frothy ring of collar and myriad chunks of webby lacing spread across the walls of the glass.  aroma highlights a pillowy lager yeast base steadily espousing notes of grain silo alongside an undercurrent of delicately floral lemon; prickly minerality develops over time and focused tones of white toast and distant honey are borne from a solidified malt structure.  taste offers an introductory touch of honeysuckle sporting deepening grassy floral accents with a contrast of freshly baked white bread harmonized over the mid-palate; the back end of the profile presents a distant minerality and residual straw finishing.  mouthfeel brings a light body delicate and flaky in texture along with an effortless fluff of full carbonation easing to a taut wispy grit preceding a steady crispness and level dryness throughout.  astounding lightness borne from an almost ethereal grain structure; a delicate hand fuses the focus of a well-maintained helles with a festbier spirit steeped in toasty bittersweetness; an achievement in touch and balance.
4478,Autumna,4.3,side-pour draft into a mug at the source.  an inch-plus foam cap of white with a golden body with a slight haze. lightly bready and malty in the nose. medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. light malt on the palate with a firm bitterness. finished dry with lingering bready malt.
4479,Autumna,4.5,malty slightly bitter wood. great!
4480,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,1.93,consumed at the san siro stadium in milan along with some very terrible food-truck food. i mean what is there to say. it’s ungood. sweet white bread malt flavour and an array of astringent flavours metallic skunky nail-polish-remover-y. medium carbonation and medium body. very bad.
4481,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,2.77,i found a can in the off license neary the chippy so thought i’d follow steve from beer nouveau & treat it like barleywine pours a crystal clear golden body with really good white head aroma is butterscotch flavour is sweet toffee and it’s really pleasant till a metallic aftertaste
4482,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,2.97,decent fizzy head clear tan color  nose a bit macro lager unfermentables touch skunky mild lager notes quite sweet and little fruity  taste more sweet malts plenty of sweet and syrupy little lager notes fruity little alcohol candy sugar syrup touch skunky and unfermentables  mouth syrupy sticky sweet med decent carb
4483,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,1.81,i saw this a lot in rome and finally ordered it out of pure curiosity. pours a clear golden color quickly dissipating head and that leaves a thin ring. the aroma is all about the alcohol. putting it up to my nose it smells like vodka. there is some cereal grain in the aroma however its mostly overshadowed by the booze. the taste can be described as a sticky gooey and sweet cereal grain. the alcohol again vodka is all over the place. the body is medium but as it is tough to get through this one hard to drink especially as it warms. this is like a european malt liquor. the only benefit i can see is if you want a quick cheap buzz as long as its drunk ice cold. personally those are not qualities i seek in a brew.
4484,Tennent's Super Strong Lager,3.2,good industrial strong lager good for get drunk
4485,XXXX Bitter,2.05,750ml brown glass bottle with pull-tab can from bottle mart port douglas australia.  cheap malt is the main flavour here 6-row pale malt would be my guess. sort of generic with vague caramel/malted milk ball notes and little else. rather underwhelming...notches below carlton mid and similar competitors in terms of the australian market.  low d / not recommended
4486,XXXX Bitter,2.99,a solid macro lager. l. light gold with frothy white head that fades quickly to lacing. not much retention. s. slight grain but not much. t. similar light grain with a dry finish a touch of astringency from the high carbonation. can have a metallic tang so i have always avoided drinking from cans. f. light a touch fizzy and the carbonation can have an astringent effect. o. i grew up on this stuff it so dominated the queensland beer market in the 1970s and 80s. so i have a soft spot for this beer and served cold it is an acceptable thirst quencher in the queensland heat.
4487,XXXX Bitter,1.09,horrible horrible beer - skip and go to xxxx gold or their summer bright lager if you must drink xxxx.
4488,XXXX Bitter,5,the epitome of brewing. this fine qld lager is the best to come out of australia. fond memories of the grain and hop scents rolling through the grassy hills of milton and auchenflower. im salivating while i reminisce.
4489,XXXX Bitter,2.77,this beer is light and clean and ok for the type.
4490,XXXX Bitter,1.5,
4491,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.36,pours a slightly cloudy deep dark amber coloration with a small fizzy head. smells of slightly doughy caramelly malt and estery fruits with notes of red apple apricot and gooseberry as well as hints of hay spice funk and oak. taste is a great balance of slightly doughy and caramelly malt and rich notes of estery fruit and lighter spice with notes of red apple apricot gooseberry clove and peppery spice as well as some musty funk and slightly tannic oak. finished with a medium tartness and some estery fruit and spice as well as musty fubnk and oak lingering in the aftertaste. smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbontion.  while this stands on its own very well it certainly is by far the best value for money i ever encountered when it comes to gueuze although your mileage may vary. i paid 4€ for this 375ml bottle and honestly enjoyed it better than some more established and expensive examples of the style. its a bit more malt-forward than your average gueuze which is not a bad thing at all in my book while being quite funky with a certain musty leathery quality to it. the esters are coming through nicely as well quite fruity with hints of spice while are also some tannic oaky accents to this. overall this makes for a very nice quite funky and estery gueuze that feels rich and well-balanced.
4492,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),3.85,375ml bottle into a tulip. 2014 vintage.  looks okay in the glass. dull burnt orange body on the hazy side. brief bubbly head but this quickly dies out no lacing.  no getting anything on the nose good or bad.  on tasting all the elements are there a little funk sour faintly tart some bitterness underlying fruit. however the combination is a little bias towards bitter sour.  mouth between medium and full finish dry sour bitterness.  overall had hoped for better. there was some brownish goo around the cork so perhaps something was off?
4493,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.79,displaying beautiful gradients of foggy amber under a dense khaki head that slowly settles to a persistent blanket and unevenly curled collar i can tell this pour at the renowned avenue pub of new orleans is going to be a wonderful one.  delicious qualities of toasted sesame seed and oaky funk meet the dichotomously attractive attributes of skunky aged hops. its just super fluffy just as the old lady described it developing a sort of peach-grapefruit note as i dig in. further on as it warms we also detect a touch of pepper and golden raisin.  the full fluffy yet airy body delicately glides to a semi-dry finish.  i wish i had more time and room in my stomach for a few more of these.
4494,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.34,a: pours a golden orange copper color with 2 fingers of head that quickly fades down to a tight thin cap that has remarkably good retention  s: a good bit of funk and tartness up front along with some fruity notes such as apple pear and white grape  t: follows the nose. starts off with a mix of funky tart notes fruit and wood. a bit of some earthy mineral qualities as well. finishes with lingering funk fruit and earth  m: medium bodied with moderate tight carbonation  o: a classic gueuze that lives up to the name. definitely not the most funky or tart that i’ve had but it allows for the other qualities to shine a bit. worth checking out if you’re into the style
4495,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.03,375ml bottle 2020 on the cork no discernible date on the label poured into a tilquin gueze tumbler glass.  the beer pours a hazy copper color amber hues with a few bubbles rising to the top of glass where a finger of off-white head rests moderate retention with no significant lacing. the aroma is nice pleasant funk earthy grassy lightly floral with a nice berry fruit quality and some pale grain and mineral water. the flavors are nice lots of earthy funk grassy floral dry dead leaves mild barnyard qualities mineral water cereal grains and a nice bright fruit quality berries and tart pitted stone fruits. the mouthfeel is good coating and very lively crisp medium body that has a nice heft and a tart and dry finish.  verdict: a nice gueuze from girardin. lots of nice funk pleasantly tart and offering a complex spectrum of flavors.
4496,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),3.85,rerate 750 ml green champagne bottle cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 5%. deep golden to orange colour moderate white head. sourer and even more complex flavour than noted upon first sample. tart finish some bitterness. original rating: at copenhagen beer festival. hazy golden colour sparkling. decent aroma of brettanomyces (sour fruit farmhouse horse blanket) but not extreme. the medium sour flavour has also the typical brettanomyces character but fairly well balanced and not too extreme. should work well as a beginner’s gueuze.
4497,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.32,when i popped the cork there was a nice bit of smoke clinging around the neck of the bottle. it pours a nice apple color. somewhat clear. 1 1/2 finger slightly off white head. the head retention is poor. the head dissipates to a nice ring around the edge of the glass that rides up a bit on the edge. no lacing otherwise. theres some carbonation rising in the glass as i watch it. the nose is a really wild and complex funky aroma. theres a bit of apple here more of an apple cider aroma. theres a farm aroma here - no not cow pies - like a straw/hay aroma. some floral aromas here as well. taste - very wild. up front it seems more into the funky floral that i was getting on the nose. i also get some lemon flavor up front. the apple cider seems to be a back flavor that lingers. the body reminds me of champagne - really bubbly and crisp. somewhat dry. crisp feeling. i do not have much experience with this style but i think this is a good representation for this style. im enjoying it.
4498,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.23,orange lightly veiled. foam white good. smell. gueuze. good. gueuze. good. citric lemon. taste very very satisfying. tasting notes? no. great gueuze.
4499,Narwhal,4.82,this is an outstanding imperial stout. deep black it has a large rich brown head steadily but not quickly shrinking but leaving minimal or no lace.  aroma is rich and full bodied lots of strong roasty character almost a hint of charcoal some coffee. taste has these elements plus hints of chocolate and maybe licorice firm sweetness but not overly sweet by any means with enough bitterness and just enough booziness to support it without also becoming overly bitter or boozy. feel is robust moderately full bodied with just a little oiliness without being actually oil or getting heavy and having a tinge of liveliness. quite balanced. strong in character but easy to drink.
4500,Narwhal,4.5,excellent..my first crack at this one
4501,Narwhal,4.21,poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 8/05/22 into a snifter glass. l - pours a dark brown almost black color with a slight tan head that dissipates quickly. s - smells of booze chocolate and coffee. t - tastes of booze coffee and bakers chocolate. f - medium to full bodied and lightly carbonated. o - nice beer to sip on a cold evening.
4502,Narwhal,4.32,2022 vintage:  poured from a 12 ounce bottle dated 8/18/22 into a snifter.  look- black opaque medium brown frothy head average lacing above average head retention.  smell- coffee cacao toasted oats medium strength of scent.  taste- coffee cacao toasted oats high strength of flavor.  feel- full body average carbonation moderately bitter mildly creamy silky mildly mouth coating.  overall- look was deep black and opaque with above average head retention. bouquet was coffee cacao and toasted oats with medium strength. flavors were a great balance of coffee cacao and toasted oats with high strength. the flavor and nose had similar profiles but the taste stood head and shoulders above the bouquet. feel was full body with average carbonation and mildly mouth coating. overall this was an enjoyable experience but the bourbon barrel aged version of this beer is superior to this iteration.
4503,Narwhal,4.04,12 oz bottle bottled on date: fall 2018 consumed on: 26 feb 2023 glass: snifter abv: 10.2% serving temp: ??   look: black with a thin light brown head. the head quickly dissolves to a ring and filmy cover.  smell: dark roasted malts with some char. notes of bittersweet chocolate. there is an earthy and mildly spicy bitterness as well.  taste: what is in the nose is here. the earthy notes are front and center however along with a more noticeable bitterness. as the beer warms the dark and dusty malts join earthy notes. as the beer warms further i can detect some espresso and bittersweet chocolate. feel: viscous and mouth-coating. the body is just about full.  overall: a solid imperial stout that makes a nice winter warmer.
4504,Narwhal,3.98,l: jet black pour into a sniffer from a 12oz bottle about 6 degrees lacing left behind as the liquid resolves back into liquid form. s: dark malts dominate the smell on this followed by dark fruits followed by heavy molasses. the malt is so dominant that i didnt really smell the bakers cocoa/ espresso. t: same as smell intended. the malts dominate the flavor but in the end you can sense the slight bakers cocoa/chocolate not really the espresso but chocolate. f: very smooth lightly carbonated not acidic heavy bodied thick easy to drink. o: this isnt a bad imperial. id honestly rate it the same as old rasputin with a smoother complex to it as the malts worked in hand with the thick ending with the chocolate. for me the malts were a bit to much. maybe less malts would be good with the substitution of more bakers chocolate/ espresso. very well done. im curious to know how it would turn out if barrel aged or even added more bakers chocolate to the mix. very well done!!!
4505,Narwhal,4.18,12 oz bottle into a pint glass. opaque motor oil color and consistency. minimal tan head faded almost immediately. smells of molasses brown sugar maple syrup bittersweet chocolate. taste is much more bitter than nose suggested: charred malt smoke bitter dark chocolate. medium-full bodied.
4506,Narwhal,4.4,purchased at carwyn cellars in march 2022. drunk in january 2023.  drunk in company so notes are perfunctory at best.  l: jet black with a thick dirty white head.  s: dark rich molasses with umami/soy undertones. theres a cola syrup sharpness underneath.  t: very bitter burnt dark chocolate with rich caramel and ripe red berries. some medicinal astringency follows and complements the bitterness well. the beer leaves some harsh bready tones in the mouth after the swallow but again it complements the bitterness and astringency well.  m: mouthfeel is smooth and a nice counterpoint to the heat and bitterness.  o: excellent beer - an absolute sipper and well worth the time.  cheers! #193
4507,Narwhal,4.59,this stuff looks as black as old used motor oil. its completely delicious and bombards your taste buds chocolaty malty coffee booze. i would imagine the bourbon barrel aged version of this would be close to founders kbs. this is my new winter favorite.
4508,Old Milwaukee Ice,5,ice beer is never going to be high end. judging this against a craft ipa is a mistake because it’s made to be cheap and get you drunk. compared to other ice beers at the same price point i was very pleasantly surprised by how not-terrible this tastes.
4509,Old Milwaukee Ice,3,olde tyme review here from circa 1994. ok just arrived in the usa with wife poor as f&ck. got some dilapidated duplex in hapeville ga. half the houses were boarded up..that kinda place. found pout st ides and oe800 40s at 79 cents were the drink of the neighborhood which i happily joined on a friday evening. came back to work and my wife was smiling..and handed me a 6er of this beer milwaukee ice..$1.99 a six..and you know compared the mls it was a nice beer..have to tell you summer of 94 went through a ton of this stuff..actually sad it is gone!
4510,Old Milwaukee Ice,4.1,(16 oz can oct1419; purchased cold single... poured into fat tulip)  l: brilliantly-clear pale yellow-amber liquid; rather tall 2-finger high relatively dense white foam... slow collapse of foam rocky center then incredibly thick crusty collar left actually some long bands of lace... looks superb!  s: expected lightly-spiced doughy aromas with perhaps faint almond vanilla notes... nutty granola grain most dominant but overall potency is a touch too mellow  t: richly malty but relatively dry on the back end not to mention that overtone of lightly caramel-y nuttiness almost like a biscotto... a couple sips in and a semi-bold mildly herbal cooling bitterness takes hold in the aftertaste faint sweetish booze hanging in the back; balanced well... vaguely industrial belgian tripel esters/phenols - great in a malt liquor but lame in an actual tripel  f: as a malt liquor this has a perfectly silky-smooth lightly-luscious body with a hearty quiet afterglow - for an aal it may have too rich of an initial contact but falls short of any residual syrupy drag though it aint bone dry either... just divine good grief; sipper or slurper it does both  o: either one of the best ice beers ive had (if not the best) or a perfect marriage was made between liquid (and temp) and glass... i got a sort of 2-for-1 deal on these cans - tempted to have the other right after this but i may need a nap after (1516)
4511,Old Milwaukee Ice,2.35,booze overwhelms aal
4512,Old Milwaukee Ice,3.31,(poured into a small tasting glass)  thick white frothy head. lots of bubbles. yellow-golden. clear. spotty lacing.  aroma: citrusy/fruity??? sweet indistinguishable grain. a little breadiness.  the flavor has some of that typical gummy ice beer flavor. overall the flavor is tepidly light like the regular old milwaukee.  the mouthfeel is too thinly carbonated for the style.  the finish is crisp refreshing light and watery and fairly dry.
4513,Old Milwaukee Ice,1.96,yellow pour with almost no head. aroma was massively like fusel alcohol. didnt come off like the beer ingredients. no malt hop smells.  taste was still harsh. theres some sweetness like corn in it. drink this one cold. lots of carbonation all over it. gets a lot more bitter as it warms and it isnt a hop flavor bitter.
4514,Old Milwaukee Ice,2.5,pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aroma has slight malt hints the taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent beer
4515,Abricot Du Fermier,4.68,l: pours a very strong pale orange yellow with no head and no lacing on the glass.  s: a nice toasted oak leads off followed by a nice hint of brett some nice apricot and notes of sour tartness very nice aroma.  t: a strong brett and apricot mixes with lots of sour and tart and a nice strong toasted oak. amazing golden sour.  f: smooth medium body and good carbonation.  o: this is a world class golden sour ale.
4516,Abricot Du Fermier,4.57,look - slightly hazy orange with a great thick white head and sticky lacing and rimming smell - tart candied apricot woody taste - for sp not as tart as some. still tart but pretty great. candied apricot and woody like the smell feel - medium body and carb slight creamy... lasting tingle afterwards overall - really fantastic beer!!!
4517,Abricot Du Fermier,4.4,appearance - the beer was the color of an apricot. it was golden orange with some red hues. carbonation was visible.  smell - the apricot seemed dry in the nose but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison.  taste - at the front the apricots were quite sour. it really tingled the sides of the tongue. there was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. toward the back the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.  mouthfeel - the body was vicious almost like an actual fruit smoothie.  overall - i can definitely appreciate a saison like this.
4518,Abricot Du Fermier,4.55,pours an apricot orange with a little haze to the translucency. transparency drops towards murky when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. head never forms. aroma is apricot right off the cuff although its mild and nuanced into the profile. stone lemongrass and earth add some more depth. it has a pleasant tartness to it leaning into a little acidity. flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch especially when served at fridge temperature. the acidity wanes as the beer warms. apricot adds some sweetness and is more forward than the nose taking up a more dominate role. its still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile. cellar stone earthy malts grass and lemon zest create the rest of the profile all accompanied by some minor tartness. mouth feel is still in effervescence delivering a smooth texture. thickness is medium. overall a tart apricot saison that delivers tasty simplicity.  served in a 15.5oz speigalau tulip from a 750ml bottle. blend #5.
4519,Temptation,4.44,375ml bottle. corked and caged. label is marked for the bottling date of 021722. mostly clear pale gold colored body. one thin finger of white head sticks around. aroma of oak white wine and grape and funk leather. taste is chardonnay grapes oak and leather/tobacco funk. lower level of tartness. really dries up in the aftertaste. very soft medium plus mouth feel. very dry finish. very good carbonation. prominent brett qualities along with the oak wine barrel influences. terrific palate cleanser.
4520,Temptation,4.2,look: it pours golden and brilliantly clear with a white head. head retention is low.  smell: it has a strong wine character from the chardonnay with some earthly flavors. there are some grape notes with a hint of leather.  taste: it has wine flavors with grapes. there are very low leather and earthen elements. there are some wood elements.  feel: it has a medium body with moderately strong sourness.  overall this beer is quite wine like but not to the point where it drinks like a wine.
4521,Temptation,2.58,have to call it as i see it. just a terrible beer. i’ve had others from russian river and this should be removed from their offerings. figure they would have something based on a wine being in the napa area but just had no enjoyable qualities at all. most scores from ba have been somewhat accurate but a 98 for this is just stunning. don’t waste your time or money imo this score is completely way off base.
4522,Temptation,4.04,poured from 12.68 ounce bottle into a tulip glass.  look- pale gold very hazy no visible particulate sudsy white head below average head retention and lacing.  smell- white grape oak chardonnay mildly brett.  taste- white grape chardonnay sour finish.  feel- thin body clean finish very dry finish sourness induces saliva gentle carbonation.  overall- a wild ale with an abundance of chardonnay characteristics. this is a large descent from the beer styles i typically drink but was an enjoyable new experience.
4523,Temptation,4.2,a friend of mine visited colorado for a family christmas and he brought back a bunch of rr goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $14.99. bottled 1-14-21; consumed 4-7-22.  beer poured deep golden with a pretty good white head.  nose is very nice a nice combination of horse blanket white wine and a touch of sourness.  taste follows the nose with a light but fairly substantial malt base that initially comes across as a sweet tart but has some funky leather. finishes very dry and oaky.  mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with each sip.  overall a sour that is very well done and does not obliterate my sour sensitive palate!
4524,Temptation,4.15,pretty color with a nice head on an aggressive pour. smells fruity tastes sour and dry. comfortable feeling in the mouth but a little after bite
4525,Temptation,4.32,on tap at iron abby in horsham pa. pours a hazy gold with thin white head. smells of grapes and oak. nice tart flavor and finishes with a little tartness on the tongue. a very nice sipping beer.
4526,Temptation,4.28,bottled 1/14/21  oh man it’s about damn time i get to try some of the russian river wilds! i managed to wrangle up 4 different ones and plan to try them in order of lowest to highest ranking starting here just short of the top 250 at #310. i’m too excited so let’s just get into it  pours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  oh man this is super funky in the nose. i’m picking up on aromas of earthy white wine wet hay old leather sharp oak lemon juice pear apple skin and light white pepper  the funk really keeps up in taste it’s soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting dry white wine pear skin white grape smooth oak and light apple. the swallow brings notes of earthy white wine sharp oak wet hay clove lemon juice apple skin and leather  a light medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp beer. finishes quite dry and funky  this one is very good but the straight up funk holds it back just a little bit. still it’s masterfully done and i can’t wait to try the rest
4527,Temptation,4.27,had a 2014 on tap in 2022 look - clear golden color with a nice white head and slight lacing. shocked it looks this good smell - grainy tart citrus. guessing the aging brought it to this smell but still fantastic taste - floral tart with a slight citrus feel - medium body with a crisp carb overall - really great beer. would love to try fresh and see the difference
4528,Temptation,4.76,had this right after pty been wanting to try this almost as long as pliny. certainly one of the top sours i haven’t been able to try. fathom bistro & bar on shelter island san diego. so much funk and delicious barrel character. the definition of a sour blonde. wayyyy to easy to drink. wow!
4529,Temptation,4.46,golden color nicely hazy with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. the nose is green grape lemon oak and da funky brett.  the taste is very refined with the green grape and funky brett up front and the oak and lemon at the back of the palate with a lingering flavor profile that is delicious.  the mouthfeel is bright and fizzy per the style. an excellent wild ale imho.
4530,Temptation,4.62,bottled 3-27-2020. poured in tulip. excellent chardonnay aroma with slight earthy notes. chardonnay is the main note in the taste followed by some apple and pear. very dry and bitter. tasty.
4531,Duet,4.32,12oz can. can bottom is stamped best by 04/17/23 batch 033b. mostly clear pale gold colored body. one thick finger of white head but this retreats quickly to a puffy cap and ring. leaves behind partial walls of lacing. aroma is as advertised with pine citrus and a true note of cedar. taste has a solid malt base over which hops express flavors of generic citrus and pine. sweet and woody cedar also. slight bitterness picks up in the aftertaste. medium mouth feel with a drying aspect. very good carbonation. savors as a classic ipa in the west coast style.
4532,Duet,4.07,pour deep yellowish-orange with a white head that lingers long. smells mildly of pine and citrus. tastes heavily of hops but delicately balanced with sugar sweetness. mouthfeel is dry and a tad too bitter. overall a beer that should be a ipa standard.
4533,Duet,4.06,pours a cloudy straw yellow with a thick long-lasting white head that leaves generous lacing. aroma is faint citrus and pine. flavor is bolder than the aroma. feel is medium bodied and could use a bit more carbonation imo. overall a decent enough beer.
4534,Duet,3.71,this episode involved emptying two twelve ounce cans into a clear glass liter mug. the pours produced an overabundance of white foam on the top of a bright and light amber liquid. this one is about as translucent as any beer with a reasonable color can get. the aroma is mostly of hops resinous and piney in character. its not particularly rich. theres much less hop bite to taste than expected. what is there mixes poorly with whatever starch combination was used. theres an unpleasant almost soapiness to taste until the finish. at least then the simcoe hops kick in and provide some clean and dry bitterness. all that foam and no glass lacing bears witness that this is short on body for an alleged ipa. on a positive note the 7% abv is nicely delivered. that should complete the compliments.
4535,Duet,3.82,appearance: pours a hazy orange-yellow body with a modestly-sized foamy white head. light lacing.  smell: pulped citrus supremes pith powder stonefruit juices an unctuous drizzle of pine sap and a grassy herbaceousness.  taste: kicks of with a lean light biscuit-innards maltiness with things going pretty dry and pretty bitter quickly. pithy citrus a charged grassy element and a touch of pnw pine resin rounded everso slightly by pineapple and peach. staunchly bitter making for a nigh austerely dry potently bitter finish.  mouthfeel: medium-bodied. medium carbonation.  overall: not bad.
4536,Duet,4.03,golden orange with chill haze and a one finger white head. nose is orange tangerine and some sugar. taste follows the nose with a nice bite of grapefruit orange and tangerine pith and flesh followed by a short hint of pale malt. body is light to medium with similar carbonation. ends with a bitter citrus nuttiness. overall not a bright as i thought it would be but solid characteristics. maybe an older can? cans says best by 12/22/22 and i’m opening it 9/2/22. not sure how old it is?
4537,Duet,4.59,a well balanced citrusy ipa with a mixture of pine and cedar notes. displays a lighter orange color with nice head and nice citrus aromas. from the first sip you can taste the citrus which was soon followed by the pine. this beer paired well on a warm day and was easily followed by a second. exactly what i remembered from a west coast ipa.
4538,Duet,4.14,really solid beer. i had this one a few years back - it seems a bit different from what i remember or just what i expected in a west coast ipa but really a great beer. i have rounded my overall up since my lower scores are probably more of a personal preference vs. a fault with the beer. i downgraded in the look and feel dept - looking (hazy) and feeling (juicy) like a neipa is not a positive for me. i was hoping for a crisper feel and clearer look. nonetheless i loved the foamy pour the piney smell and a real nice level of maltiness that tames the hoppy-ness. theres no doubt i would have this again.
4539,Duet,4.38,old school west coast ipa. piney and bitter with some citrus elements backed up by a silky full mouthfeel. pours a bright coppery orange with a thin persistent head. its possibly being overrated here due to the pleasure of drinking an actual west coast ipa and the sentimentality of a beer style that first introduced me to craft beer (and which i forced down in horror at the hoppy bitterness of it all!).  cheers
4540,Duet,3.7,very piney full ipa. stronger flavor than most. too much of a piney after taste for my liking. 1 is enough. all around the taste is good strong but the aftertaste is what lessens the score for me. i am a bigger fan of the nelson and og lemon haze styles.
4541,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.51,pours a slightly hazy golden honey color; fairly dense slow-rising carbonation; thick white head dense and billowy. incredible nose of mild green apple and dry riesling wine; ripe pear; foeder wood; barest hint of barnyard funk. sweet apple cider and white wine taste; pear and a nebulous sense of citrus like lemon and tangerine; mild to moderately acidic taste; little (if any) bitterness; faint hint of wooden barrel tones. medium-heavy mouthfeel; moderately prickly on the palate; semi-juicy and acidic feel.  i was very pleased to find this beer locally and equally happy to drink it. the beer brings a nice delicate overall flavor to the beer is not overbearing with acidity or tartness and goes down well on a mid-summer day.  pouring temperature: 43 °f; bottling info: no° 31 · 19|20 23/01/2020 source: local purchase (coaltrain fine wine craft beer & spirits)
4542,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.46,peach color. classic wild funk at the nose with a little mineral; taste very robust citrus maybe aged cheese complexity beyond what i can describe. very heavy carb. aways a treat opening a lambic!
4543,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.63,bottle date 12/3/2014. drank 12/25/2022.  awesome.
4544,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.57,pours a hazy golden not in an ipa way but a regular beer way. frothy looking head. fresh cut apples some meyer lemon on the nose. sweet champagne-like cider notes up front that is confronted by some sharp acidity. it is overall the right amount of acidity with the acidity presented in a very nice way. this is really nice as advertised.
4545,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.25,l -- golden amber body with a slight haze and a half finger of sudsy white head produced with aerated pour. some retention and minimal lacing. looks less cider-like than a lot of lambic s -- green apple candy barnyard funk dried floral hint of herbal hop. just super rustic and lambic-y t -- has that rustic barnyard funk-forward lambic thing going on again but with a nice dose of lemon candy and oak o -- essentially a more refined version of 3fs standard gueuze  85/100
4546,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.17,look – a light amber color with a nice head.  smell – a pleasant tart smell with barnyard funk oak hay and a light hint of vinegar.  taste – has a nicely dry tart flavor very similar to the smell. pleasant but seems somewhat plain.  feel – nice carbonation with a bit of tartness.  overall – a very nice gueuze. one of the best ive tried though that may not be my style.
4547,Abbey Ale,4.44,tastes like a nice belgian dubbel to me. i was hoping for stronger aroma but the taste makes up for it. i was surprised to actually pick out a little licorice taste at first but very subtle and blended in nicely as you go along with the slight orange and the requisite fig and date flavor which is what i love about belgian dubbels. overall a very nice authentic tasting dubbel ale at a decent price. well done! sign me up!
4548,Abbey Ale,4.1,world class dubbel made right in the usa.
4549,Abbey Ale,4.01,pours a muddy copper with just over a finger of head. the nose is mildly funky and malty with a touch of raisin essence. the flavor follows the nose with a blast of malty sweetness followed by a long dry finish.
4550,Abbey Ale,4.24,why did it take so long for me to try ommegangs cherry double. a) cherry mahogany pour to form. s) up there with chimay duval and co. t) more cherry more sweet heart wood shellac cedar spice woodshop. f) never cloying sweet but cleans up nicely lovely lively tongue feel. o) outstanding and next to belgians
4551,Abbey Ale,4.34,solid copper appearance with a large tan head and good lacing. malty aroma serves as a backdrop for an array of dark ripe fruit. complex taste rolling out notes of ripe fruit licorice seasonal spices and caramel. alcohol a bit more noticeable in the aftertaste. medium-to-full bodied moderately carbonated mouthfeel leading to a dry spicy finish.
4552,Abbey Ale,4.39,i love belgian style beer and like golden monkey abbey ale delivers  color is ruby with a great head upon the pour. i smelled figs and currant. the taste very much the same.  had neon rainbows from the same producer and have learned if they do one great most are great. there a few exceptions
4553,Abbey Ale,4.75,historic many occasions. so good malty yeasty maple sweetness like pure maple. dark stone fruits cherry. delish!
4554,Abbey Ale,3.83,sampled bottle rbnag 2007 in grimstad. abv was 8.5%. beautiful copper to ruby colour decent head. intense oaky malty and vinous aroma and flavour. good beer.
4555,Icehouse,1.97,i try to see the good in every beer. i think its amazing that this can of slightly fizzy and tasteless water stands at 5.5% abv. i just chugged a 24 oz can and feel very cheated...lol. live and learn. the promise of bolder taste makes me wonder how dishonest the people are who have marketed this extremely tasteless beer.
4556,Icehouse,4,its a budget beer...no surprises. im not a beer snob and just wanted an inexpensive beer. no fancy verbiage or hoity toity reviews...feel? notes of oak and.. no! get outta here with that stuff. serious? its beer. tastes like beer and it went fine with the food i ate. plus it led me to investigate what ice beer is so i also learned something. again...bargain beer that really aint bad. thats a 4 for me.  will purchase again
4557,Icehouse,3,the taste is a bit offensive but still drinkable. let’s be honest here if you are buying an ice beer you are buying it to get as drunk as possible while spending as little money as possible and there is nothing wrong with that.  style: ice lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 5.5% | rating: 3
4558,Icehouse,4,solid budget option. im not sure why it has such bad reviews for the style its good. its not like were reviewing a craft beer here.
4559,Icehouse,4.33,24oz tallboy  clear golden-yellow with a sticky bit of foam. smells like sweet corn and the taste matches. malt and corn syrup with hints of grass machinery bittering hops pepper... mostly in that order  criminally underrated on here: cheap and clean - destroys most modern adjunct lagers
4560,Icehouse,3.39,honestly not bad. its cheap and good classic taste. better than budweiser or coors in my opinion.
4561,Icehouse,4.03,i am a craft beer snobipa is my middle name. we all know this is a cheap beer.for guys from the seventies/eightieswe remember actually enjoying bud or old milwaukee.icehouseimois that throwback beer(made in 1993) that still has that taste that i remember.ive tried all the cheapo beers recentlyand they basically suck...including bud and old milwaukee.yatheyve changed the recipesthats a known fact.trying to appeal to todays manand saving a buck or two on production.icehouse has the tasteflavorandyesi will say it with pridethe corn smell we all grew up with and loved.its 5.5% abvwhich is a sweet spot between the usual 4.7% of domesticsand the 6.5% and above of craft beers. if you want to understand why your dad loved bud back in the daytry icehouse with an open mind.its mildsmoothand will help you bond with the old man.listen to his storieshe wont be around forever.
4562,Icehouse,2.12,pours out of the can a crystal clear gold with 2 fingers of fizzy head that dissipates within a minute. smells grainy and slightly metallic. tastes pretty simple not metallic like the smell. easy drinking honestly. id be just as likely to get this as lite or milwaukees best ice. not really too bad.
4563,Icehouse,1.63,it’s nostalgic because i’ve been drinking it since i was a kid 30 years or so now. of course it’s trash but if you only got some change a dollar bill and a little bit on your debit card to combine all into one walmart purchase its better than nuttin’
4564,Icehouse,2.64,poured from a 24oz can best by nov 7th 2022  on the pour an impressive mostly fine woth some fizz 4 finger head forms then has enough retention to only lose a finger a minute. the head does become more fizzy and rocky however amd carbonation is very high in the light golden body.  aroma is pretty meh. cheap lager tartness on a relatively decent corn and malt base but the cheap ick is there. not the cleanest. slight metallic note.  taste is actually nice for an ice beer. its sortof like light colt 45 or something but with a bit of that cheap ick. malty corny and surprisingly light. there wants to be bitterness but it fades fast and im not sure if its alcohol or hops.  feel is light but mouthcoating. quite drinkable and refreshing. this beer is one of the most chuggable ice beers i\ve had. short finish on the main flavors but a light mouthcoating sweet corn adjunct sticks around for a while.  overall i was expecting worse. for an ice beer its not bad but still colt 45 is better if you want cheap above 5% but mhl is still the king.
4565,Impermanence,5,impermanence has a deep rich and opaque black color. it has a creamy dense and long-lasting head of tan foam that leaves attractive lacing on the glass. impermanence is rich and complex with a strong presence of dark roasted coffee dark chocolate and a hint of dark fruit. the coffee notes are bold and robust chocolate adds a smooth sweetness that balances out the bitterness from the roasted malts. the dark fruit notes are subtle but add an extra layer of depth and complexity to the aroma. overall the aroma of the impermanence stout is truly captivating and leaves you eager to take a sip. on the palate impermanence has a rich full-bodied flavor profile that is both complex and satisfying. the initial taste is a strong bitter espresso-like flavor which is quickly followed by notes of dark chocolate and roasted malt. this is balanced out by a hint of sweetness from the malt. impermanence has a creamy and silky mouthfeel that makes it a pleasure to drink. the texture is thick and smooth coating the palate. the body is medium to full providing a substantial and satisfying experience with each sip. the carbonation is low giving the stout a smooth and creamy finish without being too fizzy. overall the mouthfeel of this stout is well-balanced and luxurious. overall tree house brewing impermanence is an outstanding stout! with its rich flavor smooth finish and attractive appearance it is sure to be a hit with anyone who tries it.
4566,Impermanence,4.9,#143 great milk stout
4567,Impermanence,4.46,appearance: pours near black with a two finger beige head; good retention and leggy with a showering of lace  smell: roasted malt dark chocolate caramel and coffee with maple syrup supporting  taste: roasted malt dark chocolate and caramel forward with coffee vanilla and maple syrup adding a variety of dimensions; finishes with lingering roast and maple syrup  mouthfeel: medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation  overall: a very nice milk stout that avoids the cloying sweetness that plagues many of the beers of this style; the way the roasted malt and coffee offsets the sweetness of the caramel and maple syrup is impressive  thanks devoured_by_vermin for the opportunity
4568,Impermanence,4.48,as a fan of stouts i wanted to try this milk stout. wow! this was really good albeit a little bit sweeter than i expected but overall it was great.
4569,Impermanence,4.27,16 oz can dated simply autumn 2022 on the bottom  pours inky jet black thick tan colored head. the coffee and dark chocolate balances the maple and lactose a bit but still on the sweeter side. full bodied thick and smooth feel.
4570,Impermanence,4.59,canned “autumn 2022“  for the second time in one tree house run we have yet another th beer in the ba top 250! this one currently sits at #168 and #2 for milk stouts just under their own moment of clarity. funnily enough they are both milk stouts aduncted with coffee chocolate and maple syrup. let’s crack it open and see how they differ  pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing  the nose is very sweet and maple-forward but there’s a delicate balance from the roast. i’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple syrup vanilla milk chocolate truffle caramel brown sugar medium roast coffee and light nougat  once again in taste there’s a lot of maple but the balance is even more amazing here. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting sweet maple toasted oak dark chocolate medium roast coffee brown sugar light coconut and dark caramel. the swallow brings notes of sweet maple chocolate fudge dark caramel toasted oak brown sugar medium roast coffee and light molasses  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a a creamy but not syrupy beer. finishes slightly sticky but not overly sweet  in a word; wow. maybe i’m a sucker for maple in stouts 2 of my all time top 10 beers are just that but this is truly awesome. even better than moment of clarity. tree house strikes again with this long time want of mine
4571,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.96,1993 vintage  happy new year ba!! this beer is officially 30 years old and i can’t think of a better occasion to crack it open. i picked this one up from oec in late 2021 who had been cellaring it since 2004 so even for being 30 years old it’s probably kept in pretty good condition over the years. let’s see how the oldest beer i’ve ever had is  pours still and slightly cloudy dark reddish brown no head or lacing to be found  honestly on smell alone you could tell me this is only about 15 years old and i’d believe you. definitely oxidized but i was expecting much worse. i’m picking up on aromas of prune burnt caramel port wine cacao nib black licorice molasses acrid coffee and a touch of soy sauce  it definitely shows its age much more in taste but its honestly better than i expected going into it and is still just as enjoyable as the aroma suggested. on the front end of the sip im tasting black cherry oxidized sherry caramel light coffee fig and molasses. the swallow brings notes of black cherry port wine soy sauce molasses acrid coffee cocoa powder light prune and burnt caramel  a medium body and no carbonation results in a watery yet boozy beer. finishes mostly dry with a significant roast  im genuinely shocked at how much i find myself enjoying this one. i picked it up out of sheer curiosity having a beer older than myself just seemed like a novel idea. obviously its well past its prime but it still held up nicely after 30 years
4572,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.41,2012 vintage  dark espresso burnt black coffee dark toffee baking chocolate black licorice soy sauce dark fruits fig prune pear skin cigar leaf with mild earthy hops. feels medium bodied smooth carbonation. overall a nice english imperial stout.
4573,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.49,275ml bottle born on 8/16/2012 poured into a snifter at 55 degrees f: l - muddy and oily with no head s - molasses fig raisin t - follows the nose molasses fig raisin leaving a sweetness on the finish f - thick mouthfeel with no carbonation o - great beer at almost 10 years old the flavors are still magnificent. this is a beer thats known to age very well
4574,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.59,2013 vintage inky black no head aromas of chocolate espresso burnt sugar prunes and raisins bitter chocolate burnt sugar prunes. kinda like a ruby port with some dark chocolate mixed in. heavy bodied next to no carbonation i liked this beer better when i had it fresh
4575,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.12,250 ml bottle 2013 vintage. poured 10 cl into a pilsner glass for this review. the rest i drank from the bottle a practice men have evidently abandoned in late stage capitalist dystopia. l: this one is attractive! opaque black wisps of a tan head that lasted slightly longer than a typical ba reviewer in nicole kidman’s bed. s: i read the bottle. don’t read the bottle if you have never tried a beer but might want to review it. i have my nose in this glass searching for the purported pear notes and ignoring what i do pick up. it’s sharp and rich; good cacao roasted malt raisins. i can smell that 10%. t: oh this is good. more bitterness than i expected but not in a gross ipa way. more like bakers chocolate. a little coffee - dark roast not espresso. raisins are present but it’s not sweet. f: never know what to say here. not thin but definitely not the heaviness i expected. almost zero carbonation. smooth. overall: i am impressed. added it to a drizly order on a whim. glad i did!
4576,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.42,shared 250 ml bottle brewed by courage 1992. abv is 10.0%. black colour no head nor carbonation. aroma of roast malts molasses and dark dried fruits oxidised of course but not bad. sweet flavour with the same elements. no acidity.
4577,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.42,** 11/22/20  bottle to snifter. 2012 vintage though i just picked this up a few weeks ago so god knows where it has been.  look: thick black full look small tan head fades quickly but reforms admirably. aroma: super pungent very nice mix of cocoa fig dates prunes roasted malt red wine. taste: roasted malt comes through more here than the dark fruit notes but they are also present. feel: super smooth a little flat but to be expected with an 8 year old thick stout.  very impressed. this is a beautiful and simple beer from a time before pastry stouts and hop-bombs and super sours. not to disparage those other things too much but you have to respect getting so much flavor and mileage from a simple recipe.  **
4578,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.99,vintage double pack from jungle jims. 2013 and 2012 vintage poured into snifter pitch dark no head at all. dominant boozy smell with coffee notes. i am tasting dark chocolate and coffee like it!
4579,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4,1977 vintage. dark medium body. espresso bakers chocolate raisin. little bit of oxidation from the years but can definitely see its former greatness.
4580,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.5,2012 vintage. #066482 tan head with some lace. dark brown/black color.  this is a master crafted ris. dark chocolate cocoa figs raisins molasses massive port notes other dark dried fruits caramel bakers chocolate. smooth silky easy drinking. full bodied with a great feel. perfect level of carbonation. i’d rather have this over pastry stouts any day. amazed with this bottle.
4581,DFPF,4.26,on tap at bayberry beer hall  well i wasn’t expecting bayberry to have the ba highest rated berliner weisse on tap for their 6th anniversary party but i’m hyped that they do. let’s get into it  pours a clear ruby reddish with a finger of pinkish red head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  honestly the nose on this one isn’t anything too impressive. i dig it but it’s a bit sweet. i’m picking up on aromas of cherry candy passion fruit pineapple juice crackery malt lemon zest light dragonfruit and vanilla  oh no i stand corrected that is much better in taste. nicely tart and well balanced. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting passion fruit underripe mango lemon juice apricot gummy straw apple cider vinegar dragonfruit and tart cherry. the swallow brings notes of lemon juice pineapple juice dragonfruit cherry candy crackery malt underripe mango and a touch of vanilla  a medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a a crisp beer. finishes slightly sticky but the feel isn’t ruined by it  this is very solid stuff. it doesn’t quite live up to my expectations but it was still great to try
4582,DFPF,4.21,brewers notes: berliner weisse brewed with dragon fruit and passion fruit  saw the #1 rated berliner weiss at empire liquors! hello? yes please !!  chilled clear bomber bottle to show off the big pink liquid. ruby red liquid capped by a pink fizzy foam cap that quickly fades when poured into a schilling stemmed glass  aroma is passion fruit and i guess dragon fruit  taste is passion fruit tart  not too sweet  and i guess again dragon fruit  fizzy  sudsy mouthfeel that settles to a tart tanginess  cleancrisp tangy  good beer
4583,DFPF,3.83,bites of fruit flesh as you sip through this very bright end vibrant look aid spritz
4584,DFPF,4.9,#69 the real deal holyfield!
4585,Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.01,(~5 oz tiny snifter draft pour at monks for zwanze day 2022... review copied from scant notes taken on my phone)  pale bitter palate numbing...  what i can add from memory: somewhat tart and biting but lines were blurred with its sedate subtly herbal delayed bitter hum... took my time sipping this one trying to delineate where the funk ended and hop infusion began... cloudy in appearance and expression... id of course be curious to try this from a bottle decant... decent opener for the event (2037)
4586,Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.03,pours a hazy gold 1 white head mild lacing. nose is hairspray lemon hay and lots of barny wet funk. taste follows forward with sweet mildly tart white wine lemon but little expression of the funkier elements on the nose. as it warms the sweetness and tartness of the wine continue to open but little in the way of earthy funkier elements. feel is smooth with moderate carbonation but it drinks cleanly and invitingly. overall however lacking in some complexity on the palate.
4587,Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.46,2019 vintage; stored under okay conditions (stable environment very little light) the beer pours a nice off-white head that forms at a moderate pace: not too fast but gradual. the beer itself is a clear metallic amber color that looks very good.  the smell is absolutely wonderful. it starts off with light strawberry notes while cold and warms up to let through a variety of citrus fruit notes such as grapefruit orange a light lemon and hints of lime that pop in and out. the funk note is moderate with hay notes to it.  the taste is very good. it has a strong citrus fruit note upfront that consists of grapefruit and a stronger lime note than in the smell. the funk shows up mostly as a musty hay not with a acidic tartness to it.  the feel is good. it has a light to medium body and moderate carbonation. it has moderate acidity.  overall a delicious cuvee worth getting and holding for a few years in ideal conditions ( away from light and stable temps).
4588,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.49,had the pleasure of sharing a 2018 bomber with my son. poured nice and dark. aromatic to the core with all the notes mentioned herein. was a tad worried it was aged 5 years but it was the perfect age for us.
4589,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.63,bottled on 9/25/19 consumed on 6/27/23. served and consumed starting at 45 f and warming to close to room temperature.  look: deep dark brown almost (but not quite) black. thin chocolate colored head but more than i expected for a four year old bottle.  smell: maple and chocolate and immediately obvious with noticeable bourbon as well. little to no coffee.  taste: the strong maple sweetness and the bourbon are noticeable first. some chocolate is there but very little coffee except for some bitterness in the aftertaste. the lack of an overwhelming coffee taste works well here as it lets the maple and bourbon shine but provides just enough bitterness to offset the maple sweetness.  feel: silky and smooth with a moderate bite on the back end. the 11.3% abv is more noticeable in the feel that the taste. warmth and a mild sting from the alcohol are both present but not in overwhelming amounts.  overall: this is a world-class beer for good reasons. this is my very last bottle so unless founders re-releases it in the future ill just say cbs will forever be one of the absolute best barrel aged stouts i have ever had the pleasure of sampling.
4590,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.62,bottled 9.25.19  poured at about 40° into a tulip glass  pours a deep coffee brown with a surprising one finger+ mocha colored head. thin almost sheet like lacing and visible rising carbo. impressive for this older brew. 4.75  met with maple as soon as i opened the cap and its still the dominant note though there is some very slight bourbon. 4.5  big maple and chocolate just a minor hint of coffee. touch of char and barrel maybe slight leather. 4.5  body is wicked smooth with zero sign of how big and burly this beer is. slight warming blossom as it went down. 11.3% is non-existent- even halfway through the bottle. dangerous! 5  overall a world class stout as it says it is that doesnt need my words but happily leave them anyway as it was a delight of an experience. havent enjoyed this fresh but 4-year mark is truly excellent. 4.75
4591,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.27,12 oz bottle bottled on date: 10.01.2019 consumed on: 14 mar 2023 glass: snifter abv: 11.3% serving temp: room temp   look: opaque black with a 2+ finger creamy light brown head. the head slowly dissipates to a thick ring and thin cover. lacing is excellent.  smell: a fairly sweet nose. semi-sweet chocolate. some brown sugar and maple syrup. light notes of vanilla. faint ones of coffee. a touch of bourbon.  taste: follows the nose but with the maple and the sweetness much more pronounced. and the bourbon notes. the coffee cannot be noticed until fairly late in the sip. the alcohol is noticeable and provides a bit of a sting at the end along with warmth.  feel: smooth silky and mouth-coating. very noticeable warmth and a sting from the alcohol. the body is medium-full.  overall: a very nice imperial stout. complex. this brew is definitely sweet which makes it a dessert beer for me.  just to note - this beer is 2.5 years old. that must have had an effect.
4592,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.33,2019 bomber poured at 53° into a founders brewing sniffer. age said no head so this pours flat black with just a whisper of beige foam that ghosted out fast. awesome room-filling aroma of fresh pulled espresso a chocolatiers best offering in his shop quite light bourbon too. bold flavor - but god awful sweet - tastes of dark chocolate covered coffee beans vanilla maple syrup a bit of mild tobacco. finishes short with barrel and maple leaf candy left on the palate. burp of coffee. sticky lip. thick. really thick. almost no carbonation at all. overall this fine elixir would’ve been better served two years ago rather than letting it sit this long. a beattiful effort nonetheless..
4593,Golden Eagle Beer,2.28,i had a bottle in an indian restaurant. fizzy golden-yellowish white head that dissipated quickly.  grainy smell and the taste pretty much followed the smell. heavy malty taste up front without much finish no surprises.  bottom line: it was ok with my meal but got less and less appetizing as it warmed. i’ll try not to order it again.
4594,Golden Eagle Beer,2.79,turbid pale yellow with very little white head. some splotches of lace. smell is beer like. taste is american macro style lager but without the clarity. tastes slightly phenolic. mouthfeel is light with modest carbonation. finish lightly sweet. overall with no year date this could be many years old. lots of suspended particles. i hope this beer doesnt attack my system tonight.
4595,Golden Eagle Beer,3.09,bland ugly looking beer that had done separated sediment. smell is cloying sweet of corn and honey. taste is far better than the nose. tastes of lemon and champagne are bright and zesty leaving a mild vinegar finish. finishes crisp. quite fascinating for an adjunct. really hits the spot with spicy food.
4596,Golden Eagle Beer,3,smells great! it smells fruity but tastes a bit like a dilkuted sam adams. pretty drinkable with some chicken tikka!
4597,Golden Eagle Beer,3.81,golden eagle lager beer has a thick slightly off-white head a clear very bubbly deep golden appearance and lots of thick lacing sticking to the sides of the glass. when i swished the bottom and poured some yeast chunks were seen in the foam and the foam turned tan (at the top). the aroma is full- pungent sweet malty and noticeable as soon as the cap is popped. the flavor is really strange. there is an overriding charcoal taste in the beer so it has a pronounced rauchbier character. one will also pick up sweetness barley malt and hops but the smoke is overriding. mouthfeel is light to medium and golden eagle lager beer finishes crisp refreshing and smoky. overall even with the bizarre nature it is still quite good. check it out for an unusual experience.  rjt
4598,Beniaka,3.59,popping the top at sushi sake i get a lot of caramel waft. pours to a deep root beer color. taste is smooth and sweet but there is not a lot of body. a bit watery but the flavor makes up for it. for the great aroma i expected more but is a great brew to enjoy sushi and not get weighted down. overall very quaffable.
4599,Beniaka,3.5,brew: coedo brewery (kyodo shoji koedo brewery) – beniaka  intro: 12 oz. poured into a tulip glass. shared with a friend  appearance: dark reddish brown in color. minimal head maybe 1 inch. minimal lacing as we drank  smell: sweet. not much else  taste: followed along with the smell. not cloyingly sweet. was expecting a heavy sweet potato taste but not so much. was surprisingly balanced.  mouthfeel: medium mouthfeel medium carbonation. carbonation helps this beer a lot  drink: a little goes a long way. wouldn’t want to much of this one.  conclusion: happy to have tried the style but would not revisit. oddly enough this was my last needed style to try until ba added lager – festbier just the day before so this is style #113 for me.
4600,Beniaka,3.94,first happoshu whatever that means.  this one pours a slightly murky brown color with a small white head and lots of lacing.  i don’t know what a happoshu is supposed to taste like. but this kinda feels pumpkin-ale-ish with a fleshy sweet potato sweetness some floral type character and a bit of breadiness.  this is creamy and pretty drinkable with a slightly slick finish.  i didn’t know what to expect with this and i also don’t know what to expect if i have another happoshu in my life. aside from all that it was pretty tasty.
4601,Beniaka,4.04,lovely clear brown body topped with a thick and frothy head; sticky sheets of foam adhere to the glass. nice earthy and mildly sweet smell; a bit of caramel and brown sugar. a muted sweetness and caramel taste dominates the flavors; a smidgen of cola in the background; fine and subtle bitterness permeates it all. medium body; softy prickly; semi-sweet overall.  this beer reminds me of a brown ale. it is nicely balanced and intriguingly complex. i do not know what sweet potatoes add to the beer overall but there is no overt presence of them to be found. good and righteous...
4602,Beniaka,3.96,sample from the brewer himself in kawagoe near the brewery. clear brown - copper body with high clarity and a very good off-white head. medium body and carbonation. very good balance with a harmonious mix of flavors. mild bitterness. refreshing excellent version of the style.
4603,Beniaka,3.52,l- very deep chestnut brown. 3mm fine off-shite head clearing to lacing. s- it has a distinctive and somewhat earthy aroma. t- the flavour is also quite disctinctive but then again its the first beer ive had made with sweet potatoes! that said the difference is quite subtle if i didnt know re: the sweet potatoes i wouldnt have guessed the recipe was that far off-piste. f- it has as much body and mouthfeel as youd expect from a 7.0% it is over in the winter-warmer category in my opinion. very drinkable nothing notable is out of place. id drink it again though if id pay for it at the price i paid is another matter. o- above and beyond the japanese mass-market beers they really do produce some very interesting beers. they tend to be damned expensive both over there and i previously lived in tokyo so of course over here too. but what i notice and appreciate is that the jpnese are perfectionists and there is rarely if ever anything to find fault with in higher end beers like coedo (hitachino nest etc). bought from amathus [drinks shop] wardour street soho london w1. £3.90/333ml
4604,Beniaka,3.68,from the bottle into a reidel overture beer glass paired with a black truffle gouda grilled cheese and creamy butternut squash soup topped with toasted pumpkin seeds. l: a gorgeous amber red color with a full fluffy head s: earthy sweet with a balance of caramel and bitterness t: earthy hoppy tang with a lingering sweetness great match for the truffle gouda f: rich bodied and well balanced but definitely a slow sipper at 7.0%abv o: not something i would select regularly but definitely a treat with the right meal. pretty cool that its brewed with roasted kintoki sweet potatoes from japan! would pair well with mushrooms charcuterie salmon asparagus steak cheese chocolate cake
4605,Beniaka,3.42,pours a dirty brown color - cloudy and somewhat hazy. thin tan head dissipates util there is about a quarter inch of velvety foam that lingers for some time. solid head retention.  aroma is interesting - there is some spice bready malts sweat potato and some soapy vegetal hops. this is frankly unlike any beer ive ever smelled. almost reminds me of an overly old spiced pumpkin ale ...  taste has notes of bready malts initially - it tastes like a lager up front. you then get this spicy peppery note along with a sweet potato note and a bitter earthy finish.  feel is light to medium bodied. the bitterness coats the mouth and leaves a lingering sensation in the back of the mouth. mild to moderate carbonation.  overall this is a truly unique beer - my first and only experience with happoshu. this particular example is a solid beer - but would seem to me to be more of an acquired taste.
4606,Beniaka,3.69,poured into a seattle beer week pint glass. pours a medium reddish browna with a fizzy light khaki head that dissipates quickly to a thin film that is then persistant. aroma of biscuit malt and unidentifiable vegetable that does smell somewhat like sweet potato if you are expecting it; mostly malty and vegetal. flavor is semi-sweet biscuit malt slight brown sugar and light sweet potato mildly earthy with a malty and lightly grassy op finish. medium bodied with light creaminess and good mouth feel. i got this because ive enjoyed sweet potato ales in the past and always looking for craft offerings from japan. i was a little discouraged to see somewhat low ratings for this especially after the odd vegetable notes in the aroma. however i was pleasantly surprised by the flavor which has genuine sweet potato character but well balanced by the malt which has a nice dark malt profile similar to a bock. this is not a typical happoshu and at the top of the abv range for the style; id probably characterize it as a vegetable beer. i guess im fan of sweet potato beers and i rather liked this.
4607,Beniaka,3.82,a brown ale brewed with sweet potato a very cool beer that i have not seen for sale in colorado before now. the bottles are neat custom glass with the letters of the brewery stamped in to the neck. we rarely see japanese craft brands here so this was an exciting one to find. a light brown dark amber mahogany beer with a swiftly rising white airy head with excellent retention crystal clear and pretty in the glass. aroma is a little sweet sort of starchy and earthy and candied baked warming and autumnal but also very simple lacking the cocoa profile of a lot of brown ales despite the color and thats true in the flavor too. there is a nice nuttiness to this a pleasant even sweetness throughout maple syrup and brown sugar but it stays drinkable. i want to taste more of the sweet potato i think a lot of it is fermented out and it makes the malt base seem kind of thin and overly simple for the style. a little more roast and chocolate character here would be awesome but i like it being a little lighter and easy drinking too. i am surprised the potato isnt more obvious in the flavor. i am also used to japanese beers having interesting yeast characteristics but this one seems sort of simple and generic a basic ale type without a ton of flavor. still overall this beer seems high quality fancy even and quite unique a mix of red and brown ale qualities in a really smooth and refined beer overall. fun stuff i hope to see more of their stuff around! this is great at the holiday table really festive without being spiced!
4608,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.5,this is a black oily-looking brew with a diminutive tan head. wonderful toasted grain aromas in the nose. dark-roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors dominate the palate. creamy in texture. i look forward to having it again.
4609,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.27,pours a clear dark brown with a massive tan head that leaves nice lacing as it falls away. aroma is fresh roasted coffee. flavor is coffee forward with dark roasted malt. feel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. overall this is delicious. enuf said.
4610,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.18,12oz can into a pint glass. canned 11/2/20 so 2 years old.  looks decent enough. darkest brown body small white head shrinks to a ring. no lacing. some tiny dark floaties.  nice smooth coffee aroma.  on tasting the coffee flavor is still excellent after 2 years. smooth rich warming. no roast at all.  mouth between medium and full finish coffee and some warming.  overall glad to have risked this one coffee has either not faded much or was phenomenal fresh. kinda one dimensional but a dimension im happy to be in right now.
4611,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.31,closing out the last days of winter with this tasty coffee stout. hits on all points nice cold brew coffee influence delicious taste and smell and abv well hidden. killer deal at $10 for 6.
4612,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.33,12oz can  clear cola color the scent is boozy and distant lots of coffee bean. taste is so good im not even a huge fan of these coffee stouts but this is just done damn well. the hops and the dark grains and the coffee all meld into one flavor i wasted one of these on a roast and regret it. world-class
4613,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.24,great value bang for buck. coffee coffee coffee. this is a load of coffee in a beer. not to thick. can’t taste alcohol. pretty delicious for $10 a six pack
4614,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.24,brewhouse coffee stout pours an almost black color with not much head. aroma is fresh cold press coffee. flavor is a nice rich sweet malty stout with fresh cold press coffee flavors mixed in. good body and feel. overall very good coffee stout flavors blend great.
4615,Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,4.72,one of my favorite oktoberfest beers. you cannot go wrong with hofbrau house. tastes great with a little bitterness. definitely in my top 3 i buy every year.
4616,Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,3.82,crystal clear light amber body; decent carbonation; thick white head fluffy and lasting. low-key malt nose; light cereal grain with a gentle caramel note. the taste presents a lightly sweet and toasty flavor; mild caramel; mild hop bitterness; well-hidden alcohol presence. medium-light body; crisp; soft dryness offsetting the lightly sticky residual sugars.  a nice well-rounded festbier balanced and easy drinking.  pouring temperature: 51 °f; bottling info: l 143w source: local purchase (coaltrain fine wine craft beer & spirits)
4617,Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,4.7,out of that wacky 11.2 oz (i.e. wheres my last sip) bottle. first off im a big dark lager guy so this is a bit out of my regular wheelhouse (who the hell made wheelhouse up for us all cause i cant find the rest of the boat). this ocktoberfestbier is a real winner however in the category. just the best bread like taste complimented properly by enough hops. the carb was a little lively for a bit but settled in with some patience. color is the attractive golden hue expected. i like it much more than any other so far and i thought sierra nevadas collab octoberfest was pretty decent. i normally wouldnt drink more than one of this type due to personal preference but dang if they didnt really hit a homer here. im about to open number two
4618,Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,4.02,clear golden amber with plenty of foam in the chalice. this is just what i hope for in the oktoberfest style. warm and malty but not too sweet and tangy with that kiss of hops. this one is mellow as well as spritzy with a tangy finish. from the 330 ml bottle. im not going to try to decipher the date code as it tastes fresh enough.
4619,Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,3.97,tapped from a 5 liter can- clear pale gold with huge foamy white head leaving significant lacing. nose is floral and bready taste follows with a mild bitterness that lingers on the finish. crisp and clean. easy quaffer.
4620,Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,5,now out of all the oktoberfestbiers out there. this is the world class of them all. perfect 110/100 !!! just a perfect beer. nothing crazy no additives just hopsmaltswater and yeast. hofbrau. 6.3% abv. not to heavy not to light right in the slot. i could easily drink 12 of these no problem. might need a schnitzel after but no problem. it\s not a super  robust bread crust like the darker more american marzens or super malted to heck. highly recommend if you see a single 6 pack or the popular mini keg.
4621,Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,4.61,2023 vintage: appearance: brilliant pale gold. frothy white head with great retention. medium carbonation.  aroma: floral hops bready malt  flavor & aftertaste: doughy biscuity malt spicy hops moderate to low bitterness. dry. a little alcohol warming pokes through.  mouthfeel: medium bodied drying. moderate length aftertaste.  overall: first festbier of 2023 season. this is not quite as good as 2022 and there is a noticeable difference as i am comparing side by side. it is noticeably lighter and color and has a little less body. hop aroma is floral with spicy flavor. malt is more biscuity. quite dry and alcohol warmth is noticeable. overall a good quality festbier. very drinkable even at 6.3% abv.  2022 vintage appearance: brilliant deep gold. frothy white head with great retention.  aroma: floral and herbal hops bready malt.  flavor and aftertaste: spicy hops and grainy bready malt. restrained bitterness. semi-dry. alcohol well hidden.  mouthfeel: medium to full bodied. dry at the finish. medium length finish.  overall: i found this to be one of the best festbiers of the season. simply world class. complex malt yet very drinkable.
4622,Kalamazoo Stout,4.25,only had it a few times but really pleasantly surprised
4623,Kalamazoo Stout,3.83,bottled on 6.15.20  poured at fridge temp (and will let warm up) into a tulip glass.  pours a deep inky brown with a one finger sandy head - settles into about a 1/2 finger ultra tightly bubbled ring and a loose cap. 4  at fridge-ish temp i get some chocolate and associated sweetness and some malty body. though i do get that rich black licorice taking a whiff off the bottle. coffee roast aromas begin to rise as it warms up. 4  roasted coffee dull but spicy hop presence and a hint of that black licorice offer a nice and pleasing if not unexpected flavor. 3.75  light prickling carbo but otherwise a lighter body for a stout with nice lingering aftertaste and smooth finish. 3.75  overall a fairly sessionable stout that is less filling than a nitro(good thing here) and was impressive stand-alone though id imagine pairs great with the right meal. 3.75
4624,Kalamazoo Stout,3.64,very dark brown with kakhi foam. smell is dark roasted malts. flat and thin but mostly pleasant to sip on otherwise. it packs a lot of flavor into 6% neither too bitter or too sweet but the hop and licorice combined leaves a sorta funky aftertaste
4625,Kalamazoo Stout,4.46,first time with this stout. i love dark beer in the winter. in wyoming that means 6 months out of the year it seems. this is a very pleasant stout very smooth and sessionable. will buy more!
4626,Kalamazoo Stout,3.98,somehow kalamazoo stout is not among the 15 ive had previously from bells. ive always like bells and probably have not written a micro-review since the announced purchase by kirin interests a year ago. i suppose i was waiting for something to happen; but the purchase seems not to have changed bells. and this is a very good thing because bells epitomized how crafters centered in and served their communities. it actually seems to provide purpose to growth over time. bells did and as it grew it took on new responsibilities most recently sustainability and dei. i hope that continues and it is why i still give bells very good overall hugs.  as for kalamazoo... this follows the principle that if you don\t try to do too much at first it improves your chances of eventually becoming a classic. many american stouts fell off the extreme edge but kalamazoo continues. and transcending the its strong licorice my taste memory said: i\ve had this stout before haven\t i? i suppose i have; but it was not brewed by bell\s. it was brewed by a micro imitating and inspired by kalamazoo. and that is what makes kalamazoo a classic. cheers !
4627,Kalamazoo Stout,4,super roasty stout hits the sweet spot for a standard smokey malt and dry stout.
4628,Kalamazoo Stout,4.46,heavy chocolate and lactose notes almost like chocolate milk with some malty character. black body with a brief flash of a dark beige head. carbonated thick feel. plentiful coffee notes in the after taste. very proper stout that is pleasurable to sip. some savoring of the beer lets out some of the licorice notes and it comes out a little bit more as it warms.
4629,Blanks & Postage,4.02,on tap at brew gentleman in braddock pa. slight toffee smell. stoney mineral smell. beautiful copper color.  taste is very close to smell. slightly sweet but finishes dry and stoney!
4630,Blanks & Postage,4,on draft at the beer garden at the brewery  medium brown in color thin cream colored head. toasty malt aroma a little toffee. taste starts a little sweet but finishes drier. medium bodied smooth feel. very drinkable.
4631,Blanks & Postage,5,love bg. this was an awesome change up from the ipas and double ipas i usually go for. highly recommend
4632,Blanks & Postage,5,easy drinking. a softer lighter brew from bg. blanks and postage is one to drink often.
4633,Blanks & Postage,4.3,growler filled a few days ago very under rated style that i love when done right  nice creamy foamy head fades at a med pace nice lacing very hazy honey amber color  taste brings honey malt sweet candy notes little toasted biscuity toffee like nice honey and pilsner straw malts spicy maybe rye note mild spicy herbal hop light but full flavor  mouth is med to lighter bod fluffy carb  overall a really nice english mild full flavor well done tasty
4634,Blanks & Postage,4.2,on tap at brew gentlemen in braddock pa.  this one pours a slightly hazy reddish with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells super strongly of fruity tea with roast and breadiness.  the hop character here is super interesting with lots of fruity tea some lemon grassy hops and light roast and soft breadiness.  this is light bodied and super drinkable with a soft carbonation to it.  this is pretty excellent. its a lot more pale than id expect but the flavors are spot on.
4635,Blanks & Postage,4.43,classic light amber color. fall malt on the nose rustic bittering hop support. really enjoyed the flavor traditional english malts amber wheat hops play the supporting role perfectly.
4636,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.29,750ml waxed and capped bottle into a ddg teku.  pours thick viscous. no head no lace. big mocha colored legs. spice and cinnamon sugar are apparent on the nose. also notes of chocolate fudge molasses and booze. very pungent. beer opens chocolate fudge and cinnamon sugar. spicy and prickly. vanilla and barrel in the middle. oak booze and more molasses and fudge at the end. sticky finish. body is full with low carbonation. smooth and rich on the palate and goes down messy with a lingering aftertaste.  im actually less of a fan of this than other imperial stouts in perennials barrel aged series. that being said still far better than average.
4637,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.4,excellent rye barrel with strong taste of cinnamon. hints of cocoa nibs ancho and vanilla are pushed into the background by the barrel flavor which dominates the other flavors. it is very good but personally i slightly prefer the greater nuance of the regular abraxis.
4638,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.61,cinnamon and pepper the predominant notes. cocoa and the barrel aged bourbon sweetness add on the balance the spiciness. very well done adjuncted ba stout.
4639,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.13,good. not noticeably better than normal abraxas. id say overly sweet per style and too mich cinnamon. #3 beer on beer advocate lmao no.  okay. fuck. the more i drink this the more i can barely finish the 9oz pour. sugar cinnamon water. cloying and way fucking 2 dimensional and cloying.
4640,Kalik,2.55,my son brought me this from his recent trip to the islands with his honey. poured from a bottle and into a beer mug. this beer is has a light golden color with a little head. the aroma was really skunky and it followed through to the taste. all in all it was not a good beer for my taste. i will not be trying this again unless there is nothing else to drink.
4641,Kalik,2.98,12oz clear glass bottle. poured out a crystal clear straw-yellow color with a small white head of foam. it left some lacing on the glass. it smelled of caramel toasted corn and floral notes. sweet caramel taste with cracker sweet breads and a very mild bitterness.
4642,Kalik,1.1,drain-pour!
4643,Kalik,2.18,when in the bahamas do as the bahamians do -- and drinking an islander not named corona seemed like a good deal to me on vacation just a few weeks ago. like a lot of things in life it may look good but things can get a bit crazy once you actually commit: a lot of skunk from this guy and a bit harsh on the mouth but not a bad overall taste. not the worst but definitely definitely not the best.
4644,Kalik,1.15,this beer had a sweetness about it i just didnt like. it was also kind of cloudy. not sure why a aal would be cloudy. i would take about any other aal over this one.
4645,Kalik,2.5,i had one on tap while on my honeymoon in the bahamas. it was watery and inoffensive. it is typical to its style (an island aal) so i wouldnt penalize it for that. however even for the style i wasnt too impressed with the taste and flavor. it is versatile and works with many meals. however it isnt a good mouthfeel. the color is decent.
4646,Pre-War Pils,4.29,07.06.23 on bottom of can and on 6-pack holder. poured into a samuel adams perfect pint.  a: very clear light honey yellow with 1-finger foamy white head with decent retention and scrappy lacing.  s: great adjunct lager aroma with excellent balance of pils malt corn and lightly herbal and spicy hopping.  t: flavor is also exceptionally well-balanced with delicious slightly sweet bread malt flavors enhanced by the sweeter corn and lightly spicy hopping. clean with no esters or off-flavors. bitterness is low-medium.  m: drinkable almost to the point that i wish it was a little more hefty for pre-pro lager style but spritzy carbonation and dry finish make for a stellar feel experience.  o: exceptional adjunct lager in every area.
4647,Pre-War Pils,3.83,can from uptown market. side by side with the regular pils.  a clear straw yellow lighter than the pilz. the nose is clean snappy crisp with a touch of corn. minimal hops minimal fermentation character unlike the pilz. straw. the palate is clean crisp snappy but ultimately lacking in character when paired against a real pils. snappy clean finish a hair watery. solid.
4648,Pre-War Pils,4.5,absolutely world class beverage....  theres a reason it has the rating it does which should be higher in my opinion....slightly sweet good corn presence...super delicious...  just the perfect blend of grain and hops.. one of those beers i would take to a deserted island and be ok with from now on....  highly recommended if you see it
4649,Pre-War Pils,4.08,another 6 pack pick up across from the airport. so this is the best adjunct lager in the world? you know (sips booze) i dont disagree. lets do this.  pours a clear golden color super familiar as beer. 2/3 white head as virgin as any comic book movie craft beer crowd can get. the aroma hits those golden waves of grain crossed up with a little bit of corn. hops are fuggle floral like and largely chilled out. not trying to be an ipa or anything called hoppy i like it.  the taste hits a stronger than expected yeast note but still sits second chair to the evocative golden waves of grain reference. were only making plans of nigel he hasnt committed to any of them. the carbonation is brisk and totally suited to this corny beer. its light and crushable yet delivers grains by the truckload. this beer makes me wish it was warm all the time. not really but man i enjoy drilling these way more than some quadruple barrel 35 bottle production you split 8 ways.  this brewery makes so many good pilsners ive lost count. i think i like the polish one the most.
4650,Pre-War Pils,4.45,from a can packaged 12/27/22. clear golden color with a thin layer of white bubbles. smells of grain. light body with prickly carbonation. toasted malt up front with some lemon and floral hops on the finish. ok this is a really well executed beer that has earned its #1 in the aal style.
4651,Pre-War Pils,4.25,crisp clear ever-so-slightly sweet refreshing. i love this not fancy but excellent beer. live oak beers are so crushable no worries about a headache later. on the lighter side without being at all watery. i love the pilz and this is right there with it but slightly lighter and slightly sweeter.
4652,Pre-War Pils,4.74,picked up a six pack dated 05/12/22.  pours a crystal clear pale golden in color with hints of copper. a decent amount of head on the pour dissipates to a thin lacing rather quickly some of which clings to the glass as you drink. carbonation looks average to maybe a tick above. pretty standard look for an adjunct perhaps with a bit deeper hue and more lacing than usual. a bit more head retention would be nice but not expected from the style.  aroma is pretty straightforward. sweet corn buttery grains and lemony hops. i like where this is headed. i cant think of a better smelling adjunct off the top of my head.  taste follows the aroma well. predominantly sweet corn and buttery grains with some crackery notes but balanced nicely with ample hoppiness mostly lemon zest. very clean taste with no off-notes or funk. finishes a tad crisp but not overly dry with lingering butter and lemon zest on the tongue.  mouthfeel is actually on the lighter side of medium bodied much more substance than i am used to in the style. carbonation is lively but not quite zesty. a lot of brews in this category come off a bit seltzery but i am happy to report this one does not. there is actually some chewiness here almost unheard of for the style. drinks very smooth highly sessionable.  okay im impressed. this is far and away the best brew ive had in this category and i think i like this even better than the live oak pilz which i regard very highly. this brewery clearly knows what they are doing with lager brews. dare i say they might be the finest lager brewer in the country. this could easily become a fridge beer especially in the hot summer months here in austin. adding this one to my list for future beer purchases when im in the mood for something a bit more on the lighter side. cheers!
4653,Pre-War Pils,3.94,poured from a can into a pint glass. pours golden yellow with a small white head. smells of sweet grain very much better than most pilsners. tastes of sweet grain with nice fruit notes. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall a very good beer.
4654,Beck's Light,1.29,drain-pour!
4655,Beck's Light,1.97,good when compared to other lights but not worth drinking unless you are on a diet or minimizing the amount of alcohol consumed.
4656,Beck's Light,2.02,weak ass yellow appearance more water than malt apparently. no head. aroma watered down the skunk i dig on from the regular version but it wasn\t bad per se just missing.  mild bitterness especially for the lack of hops and body for the beer. so much water in this beer.
4657,Beck's Light,2.61,very light beer that you might consider if you are dieting.
4658,Zonker Stout,4.17,12oz can poured into a can-esque glass at about 50 degrees  canned on 5.7.23  pours a very deep and slick oily black with a fair 2f head that settled into a suitable ring  dark and dark roast coffee aroma but not overwhelming at all  a delightful mix of dark chocolate/semi-sweet chips and big roasty dark coffee and just a hint of creaminess  nice moderately filling body and similar carbo  overall a very good stout and one im glad i got a sixer of!
4659,Zonker Stout,4.18,this was another beer that i picked up at the whole foods in jackson wyoming when i was out that way not too long ago. don’t have this style much but when you come across something this highly rated it’s worth a go!  indeed this lived up to its lofty rating a land description as this was dark varied and well-balanced. plenty of mocha head topped the liquid out although the spotty lacing left behind should have been more extensive. that was the only underwhelming aspect of this brew as the roasted rough nose was enough to draw me in. lots of barley and dark chocolate in it as the taste contained hints of milk chocolate raisin currant and licorice. nuanced varied and a bit mysterious this was dark without being burnt full-flavored without being rich and full bodied without being strong. certainly that was no easy feat!  the carbonation was light as the flavors lingered and this was nicely roasted without being thin or sweet like espresso and coffee. i wouldn’t change the amount of alcohol in this as it was spot on and the aftertaste was neither dry nor overtly strong. no date was written anywhere as it was a treat to see a map of the snake river on the can once i peeled the label off. this held up well and was a clear-cut winner for it’s style as it deserved it’s rating on here. indeed i was glad to put this river through my liver!
4660,Zonker Stout,4.73,poured from a 12-oz can into a tulip glass.  appearance: very dark brown nearly black with a dark tan head so large that it required the beer to be poured in two stages; the head lingered long and left plenty of lacing.  nose: dark roast chocolate mixed with sweet  mouthfeel: wonderfully thick  attack: follows the nose; remarkable balance of dark roast bitter chocolate and coffee  finish: continues the attack slight hop bitterness.  this is the ur-craft beer for me — the one that was my real introduction to craft beer many years ago at the brewery in jackson wyoming. it’s still one of my favorite beers ever — i’m ashamed that i’m just now getting around to rating it — and i bring home multiple sixes of it each summer vacation after we backpack in the wyoming mountains. i’m not going to pretend to be unbiased; still other reviewers seem to agree it deserves a very high rating.
4661,Zonker Stout,4.24,12oz can. unreadable stamp on can bottom for canning date. black colored body with thin mahogany back lit edge. one finger of dark tan head. left lacing on non-drinking side of the glass. aroma of dark roasted malts which express caramel toffee and molasses. some chocolate and minor coffee notes. taste is slightly sweet with a later bit of bitterness. dark roasted malts exude cocoa coffee and caramel/molasses. avoids char is still very dark in flavors. has a touch of dark fruit hops. medium mouth feel. silky texture. very dry finish. leaves some numbness on the tongue. very good carbonation. classic stout that does the job with malts and no added adjuncts.
4662,Zonker Stout,4.24,cant believe i have not rated this one until now one of their classics and one of the best straight up stouts in the region absolutely famous for a reason no frills old school extraordinarily well crafted somehow still flies under the radar. black and shiny and frothy from the tap looks gorgeously refined and silky good body but not overly viscous for what it is. the nose is earthy and dry no attempt at too much middle malt richness dark chocolate an almost irish thing to the yeast some toasted breadiness fresh ground coffee and minerals just a little alcohol more at temperature maybe oats or dark wheat in the mash here too more nuance than most on the grain side without any real sweetness. the flavor has some charcoal character an almost oak aged decadence and smoothness but is yet still dry. more coffee dark chocolate light raisin and mocha character along with a silky texture than hangs around just long enough on the swallow and isnt quite neutral on the ferment right on. subtle almost rye spice to this too just a little more going on than in most of these but all real subtle. they really dont make beer like this anymore nowadays this would have vanilla and milk sugar in it be 9% abv and be bastardized beyond recognition. credit to snake river for a world class beer and for not feeling the need to make it trendy. if you built it they will come. it doesnt get much better than this in the style. i would love to try the nitro edition...
4663,Zonker Stout,4.27,can poured into a smog city snifter  in the year 2000 and again in 2001 they were named “small brewery of the year” at the great american beer festival in denver colorado.  ranked #2 for stout foreign/ export on ba  brewers notes: a rich well-balanced foreign style stout with a huge amount of roasted barley as well as chocolate black and caramel malts. the intense roast character is the main attribute of this black colored beer. the alcohol content is 6.0%. zonker has been recognized time and again as one of the top foregin style stouts.handcrafted in jackson hole  wyoming. named for a big fly to attract big fish zonker is a rich and roasty foreign style stout crafted for those among us with the biggest personalities. anchored in a silky chocolate and caramel malt finish this black colored beer has been recognized time and time again as one if the worlds best stouts  dark brown cola liquid capped by a massive  three finger creamy brown foam top. spotty lacings and good retention  settles to a fluffy one finger layer after five minutes  aroma is roast malts chocolate coffee  taste is roast malts smooth with no char chocolate notes hint of coffee  smooth flavorful mouthfeel  great beer recommended worth seeking out. put this river thru your liver
4664,Zonker Stout,4.3,12oz can stamped 03/02/21 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 6% abv. the beer pours dense black in color with generous and lasting mocha colored head. the head recedes slowly to a one inch cap and leaves a web of lacing covering the glass. the aroma is mild featuring dark cocoa & slight ash with a nutty earthy undertone. the taste is more dark chocolate with a caramel balance not found in the aroma. mild bitterness. the mouthfeel is silky & medium bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. overall excellent. this is a superb example of a disappearing style. export stouts done well offer the character of the imperials with much better drinkability. would definitely acquire and drink again.
4665,Zonker Stout,4.02,can: 12 fl oz pull-tab with an understated label. nabbed as part of a sixer from a total wine & more in colorado - i think for $9.99 usd plus tax?  export style stout. currently ranked #1 on the top stout - foreign / export list with a 93 overall score.  6% abv.  served cold into an oversized pint nonic snifter hybrid glass thingamajigger (i dont know what to call this glassware but its fancy).  appearance: pours a gorgeous gilded tan head replete with loads of creamy softness. robust...its starting ~6-7cm head height sticks around for a good 8 minutes or so and rich thick lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head slowly recedes. body colour is a true to style opaque black. no yeast/lees are visible within.  looks as an export stout ought to. i guess the head could be still more gilded and could have more of an imperial stout-like golden sheen to better effect if were really picking nits. i see nothing wrong with this appearance and it looks rather good.  aroma: roasted barley is immediately obvious buoyed by chocolate malt dark malt sweetness and burnt sugars. hints of something from the licorice/fennel/aniseed family of herbs...i guess fennel. burnt blackstrap molasses. buried scintillae of caramelized sugars.  seems perfectly attenuated for the style with a big roasty bitterness balanced by specialty chocolate malts. seems like a carafa-driven export stout thats impeccably balanced judging by the aroma.  i dont get any coffee-like aromatics dark fruit vanilla/vanillin or actual chocolate (i.e. the chocolate aroma is solely chocolate malt-derived).  aromatic intensity is average.  taste & texture: big roasty and dry with a nice undertone of burnt sugars and earthy fennel-like spice. no hop flavours are obvious...maybe some preservative-only herbal hop varietals. chocolate malt joins with its dark malt backbone to give it some balancing sweetness without usurping the roast at the beers heart. and the roast is lovely...this beer is chock full of carafa goodness pleasing the roasted barley lover in all of us.  has a subtle dryness and coarseness that helps coax out depth of flavour from the carafa/roasted barley without detracting from the gooeyness on the back end that complements the smooth chocolate flavours. rich without tasting too sweet; robust without being too boozy or harsh. a flirtation with silky softness towards the back end helps surface a brief hint of fudge and chocolate syrup before the roast banishes that sweetness back under its depths.  carbonation is perfect. medium to full-bodied which is apt for the style and this beers flavour profile.  overall: this is an impeccably balanced export stout with no flaws and few shortcomings...i will say the subtle coffee-like flavour carafa tends to impart is absent here to its slight detriment and i cant help but imagine some vanillin or vanilla bean flavours would liven it up. but while i can imagine it better with subtle tweaks i cant find any faults or flaws; its tremendously well brewed.  rivals guinness export stouts which is no small feat in my book.  a- (4.13) / excellent  *** 12/14/20 12 fl oz can:  roasty with chocolate undertones. boasts impressive depth of flavour. balanced.  god i love a nice roasty stout in the winter.  b+ / very good
4666,Zonker Stout,4.96,today marks my first day off in a week following six (6) ten & a-half (10.5)-hour days! i just started a job as a sorter in the post office & we are busy busy busy. i am tired tired tired but getting used to the pace the hours & the pay! 8=) the start of today will be stout sunday before switching to something else. for me too many stouts are as binding as cheese for some people. 8=p  from the can: wy drink anything else? [ha!]; gabf gold medal; zonker export style stout; world beer cup gold; named for a highly effective fishing fly zonker is a rich well-balanced foreign-style stout formulated with a huge amount of roasted barley as well as chocolate black and caramel malts. the intense roast character is the main attribute of this black-colored beer. a six-time medalist at the great american beer festival (tm) and a four-time medalist at the world beer cup (tm) zonker has been recognized time and again as one of the world\s best stouts.  oooh. i wish that i had transcribed the preceding before my crack! of the vent followed by an inverted glug. i wanted a pseudo-cascade which i got but i should have treated it like the bloody stanley cup & worn white gloves & treated it reverentially instead of as a cheap tart. it may be some residual bitterness over linda lou a wyomingite who threw me over a quarter-century ago eh? it performed admirably forming two-plus fingers of dense foamy rocky deep-brown head with very good retention. color was coal black/opaque (srm = 44) & as to light penetration? it sent out a bouncer to keep watch! 8=o nose was beautiful - charcoal smoke; anise; treacle; toffee; coffee; dried dark fruits such as raisins & prunes; burnt tobacco - think a smoked maduro cigar. mmm.  i used to love macanudo maduros until i developed adult-onset asthma. mmm they were slow-burning & more flavorful than so many others. try one if you can.  mouthfeel was dense & thick more like a r-hook into the tongue. pow! 8=o the taste was like a cut \n\ paste of this site\s style guide -  a very pronounced roasted character roasted grain and malt flavor with a coffee chocolate or lightly burnt grain character although without a sharp bite. 8=o holy picture perfect batman! no wonder all of the awards. finish was [m]oderately dry & i was left wondering how i have not had this before. this was an outstanding foreign stout!  i am heavy on all-5s despite the sites dictum to have them be a rarity. fair dinkum. i didnt like the bouncers glare & the feckin tongue punch put me off. howzat? ymmv.
4667,Zonker Stout,3.94,aroma is coffee dark/roasted malts and slightly burnt. the flavor is roasted malts chocolate coffee a hint dark fruit and a slightly acidic/somewhat smooth finish.
4668,Big Sprang,3.43,not remotely a kolsch. it’s a dank ipa.
4669,Big Sprang,3.08,16 oz can.  pours a hazy straw color with a small white head. not much retention and almost no lacing to speak of.  smells like white grapes passion fruit and pine. has a subtle minty character with some cracker malt.  the flavor brings white grape skin and passion fruit with some spearmint sweet dough crackers and grass. has that signature peanut shell flavor all trillium hoppy beers have. this is more of an ipa than a kolsch.  the feel is medium bodied with lower carbonation. creamy and soft. good for a neipa not so much for a kolsch.  overall this is basically just another mediocre hoppy trillium beer that tastes like all their other hoppy beers do now. calling this a kolsch is quite the stretch.
4670,Big Sprang,2.72,like the normal version of this beer this is just not a kolsch. you could call this a pale ale or an imperial pale or something but by no means is it a kolsch even if the original recipe was inspired by a kolsch. kolschs shouldnt be much above 5% abv so 7.5% is just nutty.  that said this is still a great beer just not a kolsch at all.
4671,Big Sprang,4.33,dated 4/30/19 on the bottom of the can just over 2 weeks old.  pours a an extremely hazy pale golden yellow with a finger of slight off-white rocky head. nose of pine resin slight bubblegum candied papaya white flour herbaceousness sweet grain and just a hint of spice. taste starts off with a strong white grape must + moves in to the notes of the nose with candied papaya and sweet grain especially prominent. a fantastically crushable brew for 7.5% if i didnt know it was that high i wouldnt have guessed. perfect for a hot summer day. low bitterness medium- drying medium sweetness and a medium- well carbonated prickly body.
4672,Big Sprang,4,for once i agree with the ba official rating on this one. its tasty enough but definitely not a kolsch by any stretch. less easy drinking than regular sprang if i want hoppy ill just buy one of their apas/ipas
4673,Big Sprang,4.09,pours a vibrant golden straw yellow. fluffy bright white head on a heavy pour. nose is a medley of grasses dough and light citrus notes. a bit of a rustic quality to this beer. grainy dough and light notes of yeast tangle with lemony citrus undertones. it’s a sizable beer both in alcohol and feel. despite all that it still maintains refreshing qualities of a lighter kölsch. is it a lawn mowing beer? probably not but it is one that would go well bbqing on a hot summer afternoon.
4674,Kvass,4.56,notes from share. drank side by side with jester king kvass.  extra cloudy yellowish orange with light carb. rye bread lemon tart touch of sweetness. slightly sweet rye bread up front complimented by light lemon sourness. good solid medium body with just enough carb. great showcasing of bread without being overly bready.
4675,Kvass,4.31,murky orangey amber with no head. rye bread lemon juice more bready grains and very light caraway make up the nose not macro smelling like most kvass i have come across. taste introduces a touch of sour to the lemon that compliments the grains rye and caraway nicely has some salt and dry earth in there too. honestly the caraway is what is holding this back for me pulls away from the rest of the flavors. feel works for me for the style because it is true to the grainy and bready texture rye certainly hits this home with lingering playful sourness. might be the best kvass i have ever had!
4676,Kvass,4.28,a: pours a medium burnt orange in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint medium golden yellow + honey colored highlights. the beer has a finger tall sudsy foamy light beige head that quickly reduces to a small patch of very thin film and a very thin ring at the edges of the glass. minimal amounts of lacing are observed.  s: moderate to strong aromas of toasted rye bread + caraway seeds with minimal amounts of sweetness. light to moderate aromas of lemon citrus tartness and hints of brininess. the overall smell is fairly tart.  t: upfront there are moderate flavors of toasted + rye malts with light to moderate flavors of caraway seeds and minimal amounts of sweetness. that is followed by moderate flavors of lemon citrus tartness and light amount of brininess. there is a moderate amount of lingering tartness.  m: medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. moderate amounts of acidic prickliness.  o: probably one of the most authentic and enjoyable kvasses i have had the opportunity to try to date. very enjoyable flavors of rye and caraway as well as the citrus tartness. definitely one to get to experience the style.
4677,Kvass,3.99,a: the beer is hazy yellow in color—too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. it poured with a short white head that covered most of the surface. s: light aromas of lemon juice are present in the nose along with faint hints of rye. t: the taste has a light amount of sour but given the low alcohol content of this beer it seems to mask most of the hints of the underlying grain bill. there are hints of caraway seeds towards the finish. m: it feels light-bodied and faintly tart on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. o: this beer isnt your typical kvass and exhibits subtle aromas and flavors.  serving type: bottle
4678,Kvass,4.63,this style is starting to make a little bit of a comeback which i think is awesome. i have seen more of these so far in 2018 than in the last five years put together. its a cool style and this might be the best example of it that i have ever had. traditionally brewed with rye bread this one also has caraway seeds to sort of double down on that liquid breadiness and give it a wonderful earthy complexity. its also slightly wild and funky from a yeast standpoint both sour and winey and bretty and wild its truly a marvel and at such a low abv i could drink this endlessly. up there with my favorites that we had at scratch and thats really saying something. the rye is amazing in here with an earthy hearth baked complexion even light smoke to it with the spicy almost nutty caraway really bold in the mix too toasted and hearty i love it so compatible with the wild culture here which i reckon has improved over time for these guys. bone dry effervescent and interesting all the way though. this is as good a kvass as i have had and the one beer from our visit here that i would love to drink again above all the others. one of a kind and absolutely brilliant!
4679,Kvass,4.2,poured from 500ml bottle into a sort of tulip pint glass.  appearance: medium orange hue with a bit of haze and a thin layer of ivory foam atop. a traditional look!  smell: lightly tart and rather bready; its quite different than most mass-produced kvasses ive had. its balanced and enticing.  taste: quite tart up front subsiding into a great breadiness and strong but traditional kvass flavor. perhaps a bit on the tart side but this is one damn good beer.  mouthfeel: medium body with a decent carbonation and actually a surprisingly good creaminess. i like it a lot.  overall: this beer appeals to me greatly. its got a great dynamic character going from highly tart to sweet and bready and i think its extremely well-crafted.
4680,Becks's Vier,2.84,pint at the hampton inn bristol airport. clear golden pour almost flat. aroma is sweet weak grainy notes. not much to the taste either weak bready notes. light on the palate all around. clean. weak but not horrible kind of pleasant.
4681,Becks's Vier,2.77,on tap at the last post guernsey (in august 2014). abv is 4%. pale golden colour moderate white head. some grassy notes in the aroma. fairly bland flavour but crisp and dry and unoffensive. a little hops in the finish.
4682,Becks's Vier,1.88,straw colour with a small head that disappears quickly and leaves minimal spotty lacing. grainy smell. tastes over sweet with no hops or malt. chemically and metallic. smooth mouthfeel with a chemical tang. bland beyond words. pointless.
4683,Becks's Vier,3.75,
4684,Becks's Vier,1.95,275ml bottle from morrisons supermarker glasgow: light amber to golden a 1cm bubbly white head that disappeared completely after 20 seconds.  very light with some corn & skunk there was some adjuncts as well & faint grassy hops. some bitterness comes through but like the rest this is light as well bordering on weak.  grassy hops & a light bitterness there was faint skunk & a few lager type malts & adjuncts. a bland & weak tasting beer that didnt taste great at all.  light bodied with a grainy feel to it particularly towards the end of the beer & some chewy patches throughout. the body was very light & watery with some faint bitterness & slightly above average carbonation.  a fairly poor beer from becks although to be honest i wasnt really expecting much more for it in truth. the beer was far too weak & light which made it a drag to work my way down it wasnt even good for a macro pale lager either & its not one ill be picking up again.
4685,Becks's Vier,2.7,on 28th nov 13 i had a little lager/pilsner session and started off with a side by side becks v becks vier. both beers were poured into veltin badged stemmed tulips. the vier came in a green 275ml bottle part of a pack. my son will get the rest of them.  the vier looked identical to the original becks in every way: golden clear bright and clean looking: the heads the same white un-lasting wisp so many in this style of beer seem to have.  this beer however was slightly sweeter and had less body depth than the stronger normal becks saccharine came to mind with the sweetness.  overall it was ok grainy and a little too sweet for a good lager but nothing really bad (or good) about it.
4686,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.67,(650 ml bottle b no-350 mfg-18/05/12... purchased cold single two days ago at mr. liquor)  i could have sworn the label said 22 and not 12 for the mfg year. only reason i got excited and decided to take a chance. crazy the label looks brand new... if youve never had 10-year old basic-strength pale lager before youre in luck!... poured this into my hr tubinger mug... darn near crystal clear medium-amber-colored liquid; good bit of foam on the pour but it collapses shortly after construct... slightly grainy corny lead aroma with moderately heavy apple/cider overtone; overall only mildly off-putting from oxidation i suppose... much of the scents carry over into the flavors; notable dry vacuum mid-palate devoid of depth; again not terrible given its age... fairly dry and quick on the palate with a slight residual slickness but little fizz to break it up... surprised this wasnt a total disaster but i lasted about 7-8 sips before moving on; more of this mightve went down had it been near freezing and/or it was in the 90s (2072)
4687,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.71,2015-04-21 22oz bottle served in a shaker pint. i\m shocked and horrified that the mfg date on the back is printed as 23/08/12.  pours clear pale golden with little head and moderate carbonation. smell is sweet bready a tiny bit grassy a tiny bit lemony.  taste is blandly sweet with slight grassy characteristics. surprisingly not too bad just very very boring.  mouthfeel is thin and watery. overall not great but not as bad as i expected.
4688,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.7,royal challenge shared at the 2014 rbwg.  a rather run of the mill lager its strong point is the aroma which is a decent light malt with lightly spicy and floral aspects.  on the weak side the light body is watery.  the flavor is unremarkable for a mass produced pale lager.
4689,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,1.62,well. i gave this one the benefit of the doubt and poured it cold straight from the fridge with an aggressive pour and got a medium size white foamy head that quickly settled out and no lace. color is a clear yellow with lots of huge bubble trails. aroma is the best thing with the beer is sweet beerish hint of hop and malt. flavor is sweet hint of malt & hop bitter and lots of carbonic tang. body is ok but the carbonation is so harsh that it totally dominates finish is a little strange - its like flavor and is fairly short while leaving a neutral sweetness and alcohol warmth. maybe the warmth is there due to the heavy carbonation enhancing the 5% into feeling stronger. not very good stuff.
4690,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.58,pours a clear straw yellow with a thick but not too persistent white head. aroma is malty and just a bit fruity not very strong. flavor is malty and palatable just a hint of apple - nothing to tweet but ok. smooth texture has only average body and just a little fizz. well india is not known as a great beer country - yet.
4691,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,3.36,wow. a lot of hate for this one. honestly this isnt half-bad for a random international lager. deep gold color. definitely more visual appeal than most and it left lace rings on my glass too. the nose is pretty pedestrian. a bit on the sweet side. tastes a hair sweet but not overbearing. the hops leave a bit of an herbal note. a little bit of a cereal grain character doesnt impart any major problems. this isnt too bad really. i had no problem downing the bomber of this at my local indian restaurant and i might even be tempted to order it again the next time im there. much better than the usual flying horse old monk taj mahal etc. not the greatest beer anywhere but id probably take one over a fair number of us macros too.
4692,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.22,pours amber with a tiny head. nose shows sweet light malt vegetables light floral notes and brown sugar. very sweet tasting more cooked vegetables and cardboard. practically no bitterness. somewhat cloying. carbonation is much too high body watery.
4693,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,1.3,this is one brew ive never heard of and after tasting i hope i never do again it pours a see through straw hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head that quickly dissaptes and leaves no lacingthe smell is pretty horrible with hints of grains and weak grassy hopsit has a light bodied well carbonated macro mouthfeel and the only tastes i get are grainspale malts and weak grassy hops and overall to be honest this brew is definately one to avoid and hate to say it but no matter how good the indian food just go kingfisher instead.
4694,Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,2.85,served in a pokal glass from the 650ml bottle  when you go to an indian restaurant the beer you should get an indian beer. that was the thought process that led me on valentines day to getting this beer while getting my girlfriends favorite type of food. well as it turns out all of the indian beers on the menu were aal though i had never heard of most of them it was like throwing darts at a dart board trying to figure out which one to choose. how can you turn down a beer called royal challenge?  this beer pours a golden straw color faint white foam that didnt last very long. the smell was sweet with aromas that included sweet corn and malted sugar. the flavor when it was initially poured into a frosted glass from a cold bottle was a pleasant yet corn filled sweetness. the unfortunate part is that i had to take down all 650ml by myself. that meant that that the beer was sure to warm up. when it was cold it was almost pleasantly sweet to drink as it warmed it became like drinking a watery corn syrup that was no longer pleasant to consume. the mouthfeel was rather sticky the whole time which for a light beer wasnt as desirable as you might imagine. this beer was only temporarily drinkable then it became pretty awful to drink. it wasnt the worst indian beer i got to consume but there is still a long way for this country to go before it starts producing good beer.
4695,Atomic Torpedo,4.04,look - nice clear golden color with a thick sticky white head smell and taste - piney citrus slightly bitter hops balanced by a really nice caramel malt. really easy going. feel - medium full body with a medium carb overall - really well done traditional double. i like the east meets west approach
4696,Atomic Torpedo,4.28,070323. poured into a ba 25th ann teku — hell yeah!!  a: clear light amber with 2-finger off-white foamy head with average retention and scrappy lacing  s: lush citrus aromas of orange and lime with some tropical notes of pineapple and guava. plain pale malt sweet aromas. no esters. a little bit of herbal honeysuckle on retronasal.  t: flavor is intense orange and lime citrus with plenty of guava mango and pineapple notes. malt backbone is solid but noncontributory to flavor. no esters and alcohol well-hidden. bitterness is medium.  m: medium body with high carbonation and dry finish.  o: excellent dipa with high intensity and a good palette of citrus and tropical hop aromas and flavors.
4697,Atomic Torpedo,4.01,on can. very dense tasty malty with hoppy final. little alchool feeling in mouth. like an agressive taste. good feeling beer but i prefer the extra ipa one.
4698,Atomic Torpedo,5,sierra knocked it out of the park with the atomic torpedo. dare i say i prefer this to the sacred - in my book - hoptimum? malt and hops are perfectly balanced with the malt hiding the abv very well the body and mouthfeel light and the hops dancing in perfect harmony. this is a summer imperial ipa and a unique masterpiece.
4699,Atomic Torpedo,4.49,it is by far the best beer i have had lately thanks sierra nevada you never let me down. it is a very dank almost piney very intensively citrusy ipa loving it. speaking of citrusy how can they make such citrusy flavors out of hops? unbelievable. very dense lits of malts in there as well like my wife said it is almost as if they made a cold-press raw juice out of hops. well there you have it. it is an atomic ipa. bionic. aggro. rad. boom!
4700,Atomic Torpedo,4.13,tasty dipa!
4701,Atomic Torpedo,4.06,super hoppy but easily drinkable this beer is great if you like ipas with a slightly higher abv. pours amber with a foamy head and a hoppy taste. i would drink this again.
4702,Bomb!,4.46,l: pours a dark hickory forms no head and a very thin espresso ring around the edge of the snifter. no noticeable lacing or retention with a distinctive oily character. has a crunchy dark chocolate hue when held to the light.  s: cacao nibs bourbon barrel oak vanilla and coffee. hints of chili heat.  t: strong coffee roast cacao nibs vanilla and roasted malts. slightly astringent. faint chili burn in finish.  f: medium- to full-bodied. thick creamy mouthfeel. moderate carbonation.  o: the sun rises in the east prairie delivers another outstanding stout.
4703,Bomb!,4.47,got a bottle of this from charleston beer exchange years ago. finally getting a chance to try it and i am stocked. i have had this fresh on draft but that was probably 6 years ago and i was unable to get a review done.  pours pitch black with a small wispy toffee colored head. sporadic lacing. aroma is coffee and chocolate and figs and alcohol. mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking. slightly watered down but wonderful flavor overall. i enjoyed the draft version more and this bottle was a bit of a letdown. solid beer but plenty better.
4704,Bomb!,4.75,look: exceptionally dark brown almost black. very thin mocha colored head minor lacing.  smell: very well-mixed chocolate and vanilla fight for dominance. moderately strong coffee and malt.  taste: follows the nose. the chocolate vanilla coffee and malt sweetness are all present. nothing is overpowering. no real taste of chile peppers until the back end (see feel).  feel: rich silky velvety and smooth. low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13% abv. warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow. tingling spice on the tongue (from the chile peppers) long after the swallow.  overall: one of the best - and possibly the best - adjunct imperial stout i have ever had the fortune of trying. exquisitely well-balanced flavors.
4705,Bomb!,4.54,this one is rich dark and creamy. i taste all the flavors except the heat from the chiles. maybe since its a year old the chiles have subsided. still a fantastic brew.
4706,Bomb!,4.44,pours a dark brown color with virtually no head. aroma of sweet coffee and roasted malts. taste is coffee vanilla and chocolate with a nice warm alcohol finish. excellent brew.
4707,Bomb!,4.24,look is black with a dark brown head that dissipates quickly with very little lacing. aroma is coffee chocolate and a hint of pepper. taste is strong with coffee and cacao and pepper and bitterness. feel is not as smooth as some stouts but it works well with the chili pepper taste. the glass looked like it had a lot of carbonation but its not noticeable while drinking. the 13% abv is not noticeable. very nice.
4708,Bomb!,4.75,amazing stout. would try again and would buy again.
4709,Bomb!,4.43,look: black with a dark brown head  smell: vanilla raisins coffee chocolate  taste: nice blend of vanilla coffee and chocolate with just the slightest hint of pepper  feel: super smooth
4710,Bomb!,4.6,poured from a 12 ounce bottle dated 1/20/22 into a snifter.  look- black opaque plentiful visible particulate at the edges dark brown frothy head zero head retention below average lacing (but coats glass wall).  smell- cacao coffee chili pepper vanilla high strength of scent.  taste- cacao coffee chili pepper at finish moderately bitter high strength of flavor.  feel- between medium and full body well below average carbonation mildly spicy moderately mouth warming mildly mouth coating moderately bitter syrup like.  overall- black in color with visible particulate at the edges and zero head retention. bouquet was high in strength with a great mix of cacao coffee and chili pepper. taste was also high in strength with the same wonderful flavor profile. feel was between medium and full bodied with mild spiciness and moderate mouth warming ability. overall this was a really great beer that provided an excellent drinking experience. the only critique i had was that the carbonation was noticeably weak but that could have been a one-off.
4711,Bomb!,4.22,from a 12oz bottle dated 03/17/22. served in a tulip.  pours a slightly thick-appearing chestnut-black with a finger of dense mocha foam. the head holds up for thirty seconds or so - actually pretty good considering the abv - leaving a scant collar and a barely rousable spattering of super-slippery lacing.  nose is rich and chocolatey. aromas of milk chocolate and chilis.  taste is candy bar-like mildly sweet nutty and lightly roasted. sweetened coffee taste is present but dominated by lindt-type milk chocolate at the beginning then by ancho chili and vanilla on the back end. tasting demerara sugar mocha java ancho chili and vanilla. there’s a subtle nutty peanut buttery character at the end and into the aftertaste.  feel is smooth and creamy not much more than medium bodied i think but further lightened by the ample fine carbonation. it’s a notably clean mouthfeel considering the style the abv and the various adjuncts.  overall nice. clean-drinking and tasty only lightly sweet and not at all syrupy. at least comparable to many of the finer imperial stouts i’ve met but perhaps at a more regrettably unattractive relative price point.
4712,Bomb!,4.65,l: thick motor oil poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer - slight head risen. no light shining through this one. s: big coffee aromas followed by chocolate vanilla and a slight spicy smell to it. reminds me of a ducato imperial stout that was made with chili peppers. t: ohhh wow definitely an amazing beer!! huge spicy chili chocolate up front followed by a easy vanilla ride to the coffee profile in the after taste. man oh man this one is top 5 in the books. f: spicy acidic heavy bodied beer - not to carbonated. easy to drink cant taste the alcohol at all. o: this reminds me of a similar imperial stout made with spices that resemble chili peppers. this for me is a barrel aged version of ducato verdi imperial stout but with different characteristics that make it much more complex such as a spicy bakers chocolate upfront taste followed by a smooth vanilla ride to the end where the coffee after taste lingers. very well done and a solid a+ for me.
4713,Bomb!,4.25,appearance - dark mahogany body with tan head  smell - chocolate fudge chili pepper  taste - chocolate fudge mocha vanilla chili pepper  mouthfeel - medium bodied full carbonation chocolaty upfront slight heat from the pepper in the middle fudgy on the finish no hint of booze at this abv  overall - this is a good beer great sipping for those chilly nights not quite worth the price of admission (>$10) which i did not pay
4714,Everett,4.74,look - basically black with a fantastic thick foamy tan head and sticky dont think a porter can look better smell - dark chocolate coffee maltiness with a hint of sweetness taste - dark chocolate and coffee like the smell with a slight nuttiness as well. slightly sweet but not overly sweet at all. fantastic balance! feel - medium body with a medium light carb. creamy but dry at the same time overall - best porter ive ever had by far!
4715,Everett,4.8,draught. basically the perfect porter. brown nitro-esque head. perfect sweetness.
4716,Everett,4.47,canned 12/20/22  so here we are the highest rated american porter on ba the legendary hill farmstead everett! this is awesome to finally get my hands on a long time want of mine not to mention i get the pleasure of trying this just 3 days after canning. let’s crack it open and find out what all the hype is about  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  oh yeah the nose displays such a wonderful balance between roast and sweetness i love it. i’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee milk chocolate brown sugar earthy hops raisin dark toast light toffee vanilla and black pepper  it really upholds the aroma in taste though maybe a tad less sweet. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting drip coffee dark bread brown sugar honey milk chocolate raisin vanilla light caramel and earthy hops. the swallow brings notes of milk chocolate molasses medium roast coffee brown sugar raisin dark toast vanilla toffee and earthy hops  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick yet sharp beer. finishes bone dry and roasty  this is everything i was hoping it would be. wonderfully balanced and smooth yet drinks well under its abv. i’m so glad i ended up getting 8 of these
4717,Everett,3.63,thanks to roy_hobbs for this one from his strike during nbs bif #15. 16oz can (dated 5/18/21) poured into 16oz tulip. poured the expected dense nearly solid black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing.  the aroma had a solid but not overpowering amount of roast at the front of the nose backed with solid grains and just a bit of floral hops.  similar on the tongue a good blend of grain roast and soft slightly grassy hops.  the body was also about typical for the style perhaps a touch fuller than usual smooth and had a dry roasty finish that lingered.  drinkability was very good a nice sipper and an easy quaffer at the same time.  overall a very nicely done brew. a must-try if you get the chance.
4718,Midas Touch,3.81,from the older bottle kept in the basement for years it poured a clear honey yellow color with a tiny white head that slowly reduced and actually had lacing. the nose gets a dose of honey and possibly some grapes and spice. taste follows nose with the smooth honey hitting first followed by the grape.
4719,Midas Touch,3.9,it doesnt smell ancient.  it smells fruity and hoppy with malts in the background. like a sweet smelling ipa.  its bitter up front and a little spicy somehow.  then the bready malts are really strong.  it is also fruity the entire time.  its a medium mouthfeel with a normal amount of carbonation.  the finish tastes like a pastry both like bread and honey.  its pretty damn good not as exotic as the description promises (not a hint of saffron).  its an interesting beer. i give it a 4.7 out of 6.
4720,Midas Touch,3.71,pours golden yellow with a thin white head. smells of honey white grape juice & grains; subtle boozy aroma. taste follows the nose this really reminds me of white grape juice that is carbonated it is good though. medium-bodied moderate carbonation smooth finish. very interesting brew i was happy to try it but i dont think i would purchase again.
4721,Midas Touch,3.64,opaque deep amber appearance with a small head and very little lacing. sweet honeyish aroma with varying degrees of maltiness. flavor reintroduces the sweetness as well as soft fruit (grapes kiwi) and spice (particularly in the aftertaste). vinous medium-to-full bodied mouthfeel; long lasting finish.
4722,Midas Touch,2.61,all i taste is saffron. who drinks this stuff on a regular basis?
4723,Purple Haze,5,has a subtle sweet and tart raspberry flavor and one of the most delightful smelling aromas i’ve ever experienced. i first had this beer back in 2005 and it smells and tastes exactly like it did back then absolutely delicious. while the taste is great purple haze’s downfall comes in its low abv and high ticket price so it’s a special occasion only beer. i also haven’t seen it in bottles in my area in a long time at 13 dollars for a 6pk there really should be a bottle option available.  style: fruit beer | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 4.2% | rating: 5
4724,Purple Haze,3.03,it was okay. raspberry taste is a little too strong. i honestly expected more. i dont know why.
4725,Purple Haze,3.71,super solid im a fan of these fruited beers. not too sweet.
4726,Purple Haze,3.69,love their turbodog. picked up a couple of sixers of this on sale for $6.29 at abc. lets give it a whirl. popping the top i get faint malt wafts. pours to a deep orange with a creamy off-white head that stands well. taste is a nice raspberry pop up front then transitions into a malty middle then the bitterness builds in the end and leaves a clingy bitter aftertaste. not sweet but more tart and bitter at the same time. a good fruity beer for those who still want some nice bitter hopping. i like the fact that it is not sweet and doesnt finish sweet.
4727,Purple Haze,3.24,12 ounce well chilt bottle straight up. smells like berries but not in a lambic way. boones farm -ish. taste is a bit tart. the pilsner and wheat malts along with vanguard hops give balance. aftertaste is sweetly floral.. nothing memorable here.0 thin medium carb. overall next time i got my gold & purple beads on i’ll grab one of these little fruity lagers..
4728,Purple Haze,3.08,date: april 14 2023... occasion: watching a sort of homecoming with shan and a beer i hadnt had in a long time.. glassware: sam adams custom lager... a hazy dirty yellow body streams tiny bubbles upward into an off-white ring... the opening scents are metallic hops raspberry blueberry smarties chalk and a strange funky/yeasty annoyance that nonetheless gives it a unique memorable aroma... slick oily watery--yet refreshingly so... some low-end effervescence at the throat... the strawberry and blueberry are punchy bright and sweetly interwoven with its bready malts.... at 4% and change crushable and embracing in its friendship... tough to argue with its effect it might not be one worthy of an up-close profile but it will win in the right context or gathering... a nice accompaniment for a warm spring night like this...
4729,Purple Haze,3.41,ok so it;s sorta pink - ish in color if back lit. its got a mild raspberry aroma under the malt. hops may or may not have been used in the latter part of the boil. most likely not but... maybe. the flavor is light raspberry ale with a bit of actual malt sweetness to give it some ( not much ) body. finish is dry with a tart hint of red berry.
4730,2XIPA,4.35,this is a great tasting and great smelling double ipa with a surprisingly light body. it almosts tastes like a belgian tripel that was hopped like an american double ipa. it deserves the outstanding rating.
4731,2XIPA,3.77,copper color with thick sticky head. pine aroma. citrus and tropical hop flavors. balanced well with crisp mouthfeel. overall a good representation of the style.
4732,2XIPA,4.02,on tap at florida taphouse. pours a pretty copper color and maintains the lacing. this is all about the hops. not malt. just strongly piney hops. when i want to be reminded what ipa is about this is a good reminder.
4733,2XIPA,4.19,god almighty i’ve been on a whirlwind with this 15 pack with some greats and some bombs. anyhoo here we go on this one. a- huge head huge lacing amber color. check.  s-earth pine prominent hops citrus bready malt  t- orange citrus strong strong spicy malt some arboreal bitterness pine underbrush. it’s good.  m- oily full bodied.  o- good lord after some of the crap i had to drink in this mixed pack i’m glad this and the normal ipa restored my faith in st
4734,2XIPA,3.96,rich and coppery in color 2-finger head. great lacing; made a little heart shape in the pint glass which is completely coincidential and your mileage may vary but still a nice little moment for me. smells citrusy-pineappley. the flavor is hop-forward and floral with strong pine notes. ive noticed a lot of popular iipas going in a very malty direction that i am not personally a big fan of. this does not do that; up to you whether thats a good thing. unremarkable mouthfeel. medium bodied and very carbonated.  i\m happy as a clam. a definite favorite for me from an otherwise eh but drinkable variety pack and very good in its own right.
4735,2XIPA,4.08,12oz can dated best by 02/28/23 poured into a pint glass shows a cloudy gold body and boasts a proud 2 head of lovely white fluffy bubbles that leaves a solid drape of lacing on the glass from top to bottom.  aromas of grapefruit and pine resin match the flavor which also includes a strong biscuit malt. a bitter residue remains behind.  feel is full well carbonated being just short of sharp and not quite sticky.  overall a classic double.
4736,2XIPA,4.04,the color is strong copper and translucent with a very little off-white head. the smell is hoppy and inviting. the taste is of hops and something with citrus.
4737,2XIPA,4.23,this is one outstanding brew! pours a 3 finger head with lacing all the way down the glass. scents of pine and grapefruit on the nose. very smooth and not overly bitter for the style. extremely drinkable and dangerous at 8.2% abv. bitterness does not linger on the back of your tongue. very nice effort by southern tier.
4738,2XIPA,3.36,smells great looks good feels great. not my favorite double ipa. the abv comes through too strong on this one and the alcohol overpowers the hops/floral/citrus/pine. dogfish 90min great lakes chillwave double dales are all preferable over this.
4739,Amnesia IPA,2.79,pours copper amber clear with nice frothy foamy cap that quickly fades. notes of metallic hops and pine. sharp piney ipa with bitter hoppy after taste. not for the non-ipa or craft snobs. an okay at best micro from indian wells with a 7.2% abv punch (which is not written on the bottle). not good could not finish - first time i have ever dumped most of my beer down the drain.   update: received the triple ipa version as a gift. the 1pint 6 oz bottle tasted much better than their standard 7.2% standard ipa which tasted metallic and may have been skunked. the triple has a huge hop forward 99 ibu and big bite at 9.9% abv. okay local ca micro triple ipa. (tipa?). cheers to bold hoppy micro brews.
4740,Amnesia IPA,2.35,comes in a mixture of yellow and orange with about a 2/3 head. aroma didn\t drop hops instead dropped an almost fusel amount of alcohol.  the taste had bitterness and an exceptional amount of alcohol sting burn and bite. its even acidic. four different kinds of hops? theyre lost in this alcohol bomb. the carbonation on these varies wildly ive had them soft ive had them soda like.
4741,Amnesia IPA,1.87,appearance: moderately hazy amber body with a modest fine-beaded white head which soon collapses to a dusting of white foam. modest agitation say by gently tipping the glass produces a surge of foam at the glass walls. the lacing is fine and glass-coating.  aroma: dark bread notes and malt dominate the aroma the hop presence is only slightly notable and has an herbal quality. in all the aroma seems quite understated for the style.  taste: the taste begins with dark bready malts as the aroma would suggest. as the taste progresses there is a moderate herbal hop presence with a level of restraint that i would expect to find in a pale ale. later in the taste there are some citric hops. finishes with a mild herbal bitterness.  mouth feel: soft but a bit thin with very mild carbonation.  drinkability/notes: an lackluster example of the style.  presentation: packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown served in a new belgium brewing chalice.
4742,Amnesia IPA,1.74,just no. this did not taste like an ipa at all. off aroma followed by an almost non existent hop profile. it basically tastes like a mediocre homebrew.
4743,Amnesia IPA,3.76,dope ass ipa and gets you buzzin for sure!
4744,Amnesia IPA,1.25,
4745,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,4.66,bottle 330ml 2020 release  look: pours black looks a bit thin. good layer of brown foam.  smell: chocolate cacao molasses and some vanilla maybe?  taste: cacao vanilla malty oak and whiskey  mouthfeel: a bit thin but with this abv nothing concerning  overall: great beer for this style. nice barrel character.
4746,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,4.34,appearance – zero head over a clear but nearly opaque dark brown body.  aroma – woody sweet molasses brown sugar whiskey more prominent than many others in the series.  taste – woody light molasses not as sweet as other versions. light whiskey in the aftertaste.  mouthfeel – smooth and slightly oily but in a good way.  overall – a fitting end to the “year” series outstanding beer.
4747,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,3.86,pours a very dark oily brown and nearly flat. not too much sediment just dark cloudy brew. aroma of scotch oxidized malt cocoa smoke vanilla and oak.  taste is lightly peaty with other notes of cocoa vanilla like oak whiskey and dark soy. the influence of scotch barrel is still there but the beer is flat and a bit watery. the mouthfeel has lingering cocoa and oaky tannins but the lack of carbonation hurts it. a bit disappointing.
4748,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,3.99,bought a bottle at julians in providence ri. $30 for an 11.2oz bottle. surprised to see 2009 on the bottle; 7-years old.  opened it up and what the fuck is that smell? it kinda did smell like ola dubh - black engine oil - at first. i guess the best way to describe the smell is if you took scottish whiskey and mixed it with water and dirt then let it sit for 7 years. not particularly pleasant at first but extremely different and complex. it grew on me.  as for the look you can assume. 99% flat no carbonation. pitch black. ola dubh. thats about it.  the taste was just as weird as the smell. it didnt taste like whiskey with water it tasted like...... whiskey flavored water? i dont know. it didnt taste like an old ale. it didnt taste like a barleywine. it didnt taste like a stout. one of the more different beers ive had. personally at first i didnt find it too pleasant. once again it grew on me. the abv isnt all that high so it wasnt as complex as i would like it. still insanely different. really hard to describe.  overall i dont know. i dont know what it is what they were trying to do what its supposed to be what to compare it to... i just dont know. i gave it its rating based on how different and unique it is.
4749,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,4.32,330 ml bottle into snifter; bottle #26077 bottled in 8/2010. pours fairly pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. light spotty lacing clings around the glass with some light streaming carbonation. aromas of big milk chocolate cocoa coffee toast toffee molasses dark bread vanilla oak raisin plum fig peat smoke leather tobacco and oak/peat earthiness. incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and whiskey cask notes; with good strength. taste of big milk chocolate cocoa coffee toast toffee dark bread molasses vanilla oak raisin plum fig peat smoke leather tobacco and roast/peat earthiness. slight roast/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate cocoa coffee dark bread vanilla toffee oak dark fruit peat smoke leather tobacco and oak/peat earthiness on the finish for a while. incredible complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and whiskey cask flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth creamy and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. overall this is an outstanding old ale! all around awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malts and whiskey cask flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the abv. a highly enjoyable offering.
4750,Porter,4.5,nice blend of coffee chocolate and smokiness. perfect brunch beer nice and smooth.
4751,Porter,3.94,draught quite dark chestnut with a little dark orange for highlights. moderate but fairly sharp dark roasted grain aroma. pretty good level of dark roasted grain in a medium light bodied brew and it goes on to the finish.
4752,Porter,3.9,2021-11-09 16oz can served in a tulip. dated 09/28/21. received from @wunderllama as a retaliation been in nbs bif #14.  pours dark with a big medium-density head light carbonation. smell is moderate chocolate and coffee and a lot of nuts. yeasty grainy maybe some anise.  taste is similar though somewhat mild. chocolate coffee and nuts anise somewhat muted mild to heavy roasty bitterness some light woodiness and some grainy sweetness.  mouthfeel is medium to thick. overall a very solid porter.
4753,Porter,4.83,ok so the beer i had was a coffee porter on nitro at the brewery but i could not find it on beer advocate. this beer is so ridiculously fantastic. smooth creamy not overly carbonated subtle notes of vanilla and chocolate. idk it’s just great.
4754,Porter,4.24,wicked! much more lively than a typical porter. enough hops to cut into the syrupy malts which still dominate - as they should. satisfyingly rich and dense with enough fizz to balance and cut that. drinking one satisfies nicely - but not so heavy that more would be too rich - as can be the case for me with porters. wicked!
4755,Porter,4.3,decanted into a 12 oz (355 ml) clear goblet from a 16 oz (473 ml) can; canned on 07/07/20. a: pours a very dark clear brown color with a two finger tan head cap and ring retention and complex rings of lacing. s: aromas of molasses cocoa mocha toffee and macadamia nuts t: semisweet. flavors mirror the nose but much more birch beer and/or sarsaparilla. solid but balanced bitterness. m: light to medium bodied with moderate effervescence o: mayflower has come up with a light but delicious anglo-american porter.
4756,Porter,4.1,appropriately dark appearance with a medium size tan head and a fair amount of lacing. slightly ashy coffee chocolate and caramel malt aroma. flavors of dark bread coffee and molasses. sweetness evident throughout but more pronounced in the aftertaste. medium bodied decently carbonated mouthfeel with an average length finish.
4757,Hoppy Lager,3.58,12oz bottle date notched feb thanks to my bother-in-law for grabbing a mixed pack for us to try l: clear golden body frothy off-white head s: citrus earthy pine pale malt t: pale grain honey light caramel grapefruit pine f: light-to-medium body moderate carbonation fairly clean finish with some mild piney/grapefruity bitterness o: refreshing and easy drinking lager with some hoppy bitterness
4758,Hoppy Lager,4.1,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance -the beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. the head has a good level of retention fading slowly and leaving a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma is strong of a cracker malt and pine smell mixed with aromas of grapefruit and some earthiness. along with these smells comes a touch of orange and pear. taste – the taste starts out with a nice crisp cracker malt mixed with notes of grapefruit and a decent showing of pine. at the start the hop is lighter with both the grapefruit and pine getting stronger and being joined by some light earthy and herbal hops. toward the end the light sweetness of caramel that was present upfront fades leaving one with a rather nice crisp and decently hopped taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is light and crisp with a higher carbonation level. great for the abv and style and makes for a nice crisp sipper. overall – a very nice and crisp sipper. well done and great for session drinking.
4759,Hoppy Lager,3.55,not a bad offering overall...  lots of grassiness on the nose....same thing in the flavor department....quite refreshing...seems more like a spring beer than a fall one but...tasty nonetheless..  a good wing or nacho beer...
4760,Hoppy Lager,3.58,pours a clear golden yellow with a fuzzy head that quickly recedes. smell is of hops cracker malt and bread crust. taste follows the nose with an almost seltzer like finish at the end. this beer tastes nearly identical to their ipl that they put out a while back not a bad beer just always a little weird having a lager with this much of a hop character. i would say on point for the style and one of their better offerings as of lately.
4761,Hoppy Lager,3.56,pours a clear straw yellow with a thick but short-lived white head. spotty lacing. aroma is faint citrus and grassy hops. flavor is much bolder than the nose citrusy and grassy hops. feel is light and well carbonated. overall for a simple beer this is delicious.
4762,Hoppy Lager,3.98,best by date of jan 2024.  appearance: pours a yellow-hued body clear with a medium-sized white head.  smell: minimally malty just a hint of mild biscuit with a soft blend of pressed meadow flower earthy grassy hop scents.  taste: a simple base of malts akin to shredded biscuit-innards fairly dry. it quickly leans into grassy dried floral tones with an underlying earthiness. medium bitterness. finishes light on the tongue with a decided dryness to it.  mouthfeel: medium-light body. medium carbonation.  overall: a simple but solid little dry lager.
4763,Hoppy Lager,3.75,12oz bottle notched enjoy before jan poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 4.8% abv 30 ibu. the beer pours bright light gold in color with nearly white head. the head recedes to a thin ring and partial covering. the aroma is bright with orange lemon & lime zest. the taste is bittersweet light candied orange with more of the citrus zest. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. overall good if one note hoppy lager.
4764,Hoppy Lager,4.42,samuel adams hoppy lager has a thick white head ana a bubbly clear golden appearance with some lacing. the aroma is of brassy hops oils and white bread crust. the flavor is similar with noticeable bitterness. s.a. hoppy lager has a medium body and a dry finish.  rjt
4765,Hoppy Lager,3.88,another one that i haven’t yet reviewed from the seasonal mix-pack. from a twelve ounce bottle this one is crystal straw color with a tall white head. the aroma has spicy juicy hop scents. assertive. the taste is solidly bitter with hops clean and straightforward. clean finish medium body and quite drinkable. i appreciate this beer. nice.
4766,Hoppy Lager,3.96,from the side label there is a notch near jan with the text below it freshness matters. enjoy before month notched.  appearance: the body is a fairly dark shade of copper with brilliant clarity. it has a medium-sized fluffy white head that has excellent head retention. there are some lines of lacing that stick to the glass. the color and clarity of the beer are very nice.  aroma: there is a nice pine aroma with a light wildflower scent that accompanies it. it has a bit of a floral soap quality to it. the aroma as a whole is pretty subtle but very nice.  taste: up front there is a very floral flavor which comes across as soap like similar to the aroma of the beer. a light bit of pine flavor comes through towards the middle of the palate and it is joined with a very light touch of flowers. there is a very light biscuit flavor towards the end. it has a slight grassy note towards the end and it has a pleasant lingering pine flavor in the aftertaste. the flavors in this beer are very pronounced and they stay strong at every point while drinking this beer as the beer crosses from the front to the back of the tongue.  mouthfeel: it feels clean and easy to drink. it has a pleasant hoppy bitterness which feels just right with the rest of the beer. its a very enjoyable beer.  overall: boston beer company / samuel adams really hit it out of the park with this beer. the neckerchief states that this is a dry hopped golden lager. there have been a lot of hoppy lagers and india pale lagers emerging over these last couple of years. this beer is a lot better than the vast majority of what i have tried. it is a beer with a very clean lager profile that still manages to deliver a great hop presence. the aroma is a bit muted but the hop notes which do show up are very good. i bought this in the fall variety pack but it\s good enough to buy a six-pack. i would buy it again and i would highly recommend it.
4767,Hoppy Lager,3.78,pours a dirty straw color with two fingers of head. the nose is citrusy and earthy. the flavor is certainly hoppy but theres not much else to this offering. it tastes like a lager version of a session ipa.
4768,Hoppy Lager,3.91,old school hop profile that easily carries the sub 5% abv. thumbs up.
4769,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),5,tuborg green is another delicious beer that i love to have with my spicy food. it has the right malty taste and it is perfectly refreshing anytime and anywhere. it is a must-have beer in the fridge according to my opinion and when you have it have something spicy it blends in perfect. we need tuborg all over the world. it simply a wonderful beer. i like its after-taste it has that crispy-tingly feel to the tongue which is interesting and addictive.
4770,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),2.77,a standard danish pilsener for many years. golden colour white head. sweetish aroma and flavour of malts very moderate herbal hops in the finish. in norway tuborg is ringnes-carlsbergs cheapest brand so the ringnes-brewed version feels even thinner than the danish original.
4771,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),3.45,doesnt feel anything specialtastes better than it feelsgoes down very easilyits on the thinner side but not too thinand its refreshing.
4772,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),2.57,had it at a restaurant looked funky didn’t recognize the name.  pours a straw yellow colour with small head that leaves no lacing. smells of lightly bready malt and literally nothing else. tastes of malt and not a whole lot else. tastes like the copy paste lager. mouthfeel is light with medium-high carbonation.  overall this doesn’t have that pilsner pop that you’d hope for but it’s also a lot better than the american industrial lagers so i’m not going to bash it at all. not sure what i expected when i got it since the beer selection was very industrial/uninspired. should have went with wine i suppose.
4773,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),3.05,i had this beer while on vacation in rome. poured from a 16.9 oz. can. has as golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is mild some malts. taste is of malts some green apples creeping in at the finish. feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer.
4774,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),3.75,on tap. white head with lace clear golden color.  classic euro pils. crisp clean refreshing. earthy grassy hops. biscuity malts.  light bodied. easy drinking. nice on a hot summer day.
4775,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),3.22,from the can it pours a very nice amber color with a nice white head. in the nose it is grain more than anything. in the mouth it is a pleasant bit of malt and some bitterness. acceptable. great after a hot day in dc!!
4776,Sahati,4.08,bottled september 17 2020  fairly appealing beer in both appearance and aroma. pours a rusty red / brown. the carbonation wasnt crazy on the pour but theres a very persistent thing cap and thick ring. aroma is really tart with clear wine notes.  taste is really really interesting. its tart with an interesting sweetness (presumably from the honey) but what really stands out to me is the spruce needles and how deftly they have been incorporated into this beer. they show up mid-palate and linger on the finish and add a great dimension to the beer. add that to the wine barrel notes and this is wonderfully complex balanced and tasty  overall very well done. ive had spruce in beer before but not this expertly executed.
4777,Sahati,4.26,pours a rustic copper with a mild fog to the translucency. there is a finger or less of off-white foam formation which bubbles away quickly. aroma is minor spruce and fir with an cutting roar of lactic sourness. dark fruit grass cellar stone and mild melon dew for the rest of the nose with the most emphasis on the first two notes. flavor profile is mild spruce again but its a backdrop to the twangy sourness. mild dark fruits cellar stone and grass help form the rest of flavor profile. mouth feel is medium in thickness with a very still effervescence. texture is driven by a very light silt at the back but not much else. overall a pretty unique beer. its plenty sour with just enough spruce to make it a little more intriguing.  served in a 15.5oz spieglelau tulip from a 375ml bottle. abv: 9.62%. bottled: june 27 2019. consumed/reviewed: october 9 2022.
4778,Sahati,3.11,too much wine like than an ale very sour
4779,Sahati,4.77,pours a dark amber from the bottle slightly cloudy foamy 1 head with light lacing. nose is super expressive - pine and spruce needles menthol lemon peel and oil orange musk deodorant bengay icy hot. taste is also very complex - sour brett and lemon peppery pine and spruce light malt sweetness; a bit tacky; long finish sour and musky. mouthfeel is crisp and clean no heaviness. overall this is an exceptional beer regardless of style with a great amount of depth and evolution.
4780,Sahati,3.94,i believe i owe this one to sharpski. corked 750 (dated june 8 2017 9.06% abv) poured into 14oz teku. poured a beautiful clean clear bright copper color with a half-inch of white head that quickly dissipated and left no lacing. just gorgeous.  as soon as the cork popped free a wonderfully delightful funk burst out.sharp bitey and slightly brett-like. the base had light soft grains supporting the funk yeast wood and floral tones.  similar on the tongue with the addition of a notable sourness especially at the back of the palate. the wild bend yeastbugs still dominate but that tang sure got your attention.  the body was light crisp smooth and had a tart finish that was very very dry and then dried out even more after a few moments.  drinkability was great one of those rare beers where drinking the bottle alone was easy no getting bored with this one.  overall a wonderful brew. an absolute must grab if you ever see it.
4781,Sahati,4,tuesday september 21 2021 9:08 pm 12.7 ounce bottle poured to wine glass sight: amber liquid appears clear no foam some lacing smell: very fragrant- woody taste: very good high sourness low bitterness some sweetness mouthfeel: very good lively carbonation long follow through good finish aftertaste stays in the palate very long overall: very good beer ok to repeat not to look for
4782,Sahati,4.42,hands down this is the craziest beer i’ve ever had. bar none and all that stuff. i think it tastes like bigfoot after he showered. yeah... my god is it foresty/piney but not like a dank ipa - this one is straight liquid forest. wow. umm what am i supposed to do now? i’m like lost in wonder. i dunno if i want the entire bottle but i think the entire bottle wants me. so i’ll have at it. damn it is super clean... ok i’m just going to live in the moment like with that girl on catalina island in 2000.  peace!
4783,Sahati,4.31,bottle date: 6/14/18 palate contaminants: other beer  cloudy and medium brown. good amount of fine off-white head but little lacing. it just looks thick.  the scent seems to have every part of a tree cedar specifically. definitely the needles (or whatever you call them on a cedar tree) and definitely the sap. the wood seems to have a little bit of sharp (but not overly) acidic astringency. it\s fair to say there\s something between apple cider and apple vinegar. points for coming off as fresh too. wild stuff.  the initial taste is definitely with the apple cider/vinegar. it\s like it runs up to the border of overbearing then stops. the cedar needles are next although there\s not much of any other part of the tree. (some sips it actually hits me more as wood but still there\s only one component i can pick out.) sneaky sweet.  carbonation takes a bit of agitation to bring out but its foamy. alcohol barely detectable yet i feel it after a few minutes. medium-heavy weight. aftertaste is still mostly apple cider but other fruits (sour cherry and pear specifically) do show up after the astringency abates.
4784,Sahati,4.29,sweet sour and nice...
4785,Sahati,4.3,*poured into a teku glass from a 375ml bottle*  *bottled on 6/27/19*  *drank on 7/15/20*  this beer poured a cloudy amber color in my glass. the head or lack thereof was white and left a thin lacing around my glass. there really wasnt any head to speak of which is pretty common for a lot of farmhouse ales.  on the nose i generally got prominent notes of sourness pine notes and a bit of an apple like sweetness throughout. upfront i definitely got notes of funk in the front and notes of resin pine and honey in the back-end.  the taste was sour-forward as expected. the beer also brought a nice complexity to it giving me prominent notes of pears apples resin and oak upfront with a bit of a wine undertones throughout. the apples and pear notes were more prominent in the middle and the beer finishes with a pronounced lemon sourness.  for a 10.5% abv beer this was crazy drinkable. i actually didnt get any notes of alcohol in this. with a low carbonation and light body this was very drinkable and good. there was no bitterness to this and no lingering aftertaste. this was probably the best farmhouse ale ive had up to this point.  overall i found this beer to have a nice complexity to it while also having a nice sour-forward taste without being completely overwhelming on the palate. the nice notes of pine apples pear and honey in this beer without any bitter or alcoholic taste to it made this beer ridiculously easy to drink. very nice very good.
4786,Sahati,4.02,acorn brown with a tiny khaki head that instantly fizzles out to a bubbly noisy surface.  smell is crabapple red wine barrel and an herbal potpourri mint-like yet resinous evergreen forest.  the medium round body is crisped up by an effervescence that immediately introduces tangy lemon-limeade accented in short order by spruce resin and even a sort of mint julep character that includes a touch of oak that dries to a semi-bitter lightly toasty charred finish. it even becomes a little smoky and hammy after introducing a bite of redskin peanuts to the palate.  a very unique brew that makes me wish i was camping in the redwoods right about now.
4787,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.39,liked this a bit more than the galaxy version - both pale in comparison to the ddh version but this was really solid. a little more dank than the other two versions but that\s a-ok with me. medium body a little heavier than what i\d classify as an easy drinker however these are perfect for a day at the pool or cracking on a hot muggy day. good to great beer - you won\t be disappointed in this one.
4788,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.75,canned 11/03/2020. enjoyed on 11/27/2020.
4789,Hite,4.13,i always have this crisp golden smooth and sweet malty lager at the kbbqs
4790,Hite,2.95,light and easy drinking with hints of sweetness even a bit of lemon-lime soda on the nose that reflect in the taste as well. one of those not a lot to laud or complain about.
4791,Hite,2.5,330 ml bottle from green peas stavanger. abv is 4.3%. crystal clear pale golden colour moderate white head. sweetish aroma of pilsener malts grass and maize. light bodied citric mouthfeel. sweet and citric flavour notes of grass and maize again a modest bitterness.
4792,Hite,2.67,drink it cold. as cold as you can get this. pours clear minimal aroma bland fizzy flavor quick finish. this comes in cans bottles and even plastic bottles so that’s something.
4793,Hite,2.93,this is not a great beer. not even really a good one. but i love it. for some reason i always seem to have a case of it in the house. its bland and boring has no real taste to it. but its another beer thats fantastic on a hot day. if you want hops or anything beyond the malt and rice this is going to be very disappointing. but taken for what it is the sk rendition of budweiser i kind of dig it.
4794,Hite,2.82,drink this a lot back in old days in korea because i was a college student with tight budget. typical but blend pale lager and it is easy to drink gives you refresh feelings... does not have rich aroma. lack of body. even nowadays in korea this beer isnt for savoring but to mix with soju making higher alcohol content which is called somac (soju + macju(beer)) so korean people who tend to enjoy binge drinking can get drunk easily. few weeks ago i went to local vietnamese restaurant and they had this beer for their beer menu. it gives me nostalgic feeling but skipped and ordered tiger from singapore. i would drink hite beer again if i only meet my good old friends from high school or college at neighborhood tavern.
4795,1554,3.67,poured from a 12-oz bottle into a frosted pint glass at oscars bar & grille in limon co.  appearance: dark brown with a massive light tan head that lasted long and left abundant lacing.  nose: rich roast bread.  mouthfeel: light.  attack: sort of follows the nose adding bitter roast a bit too quickly; i was hoping for a little more depth in the flavor.  finish: continues and resolves the bitterness with some hops.  overall: the look and the nose set me up for higher expectations. it’s drinkable but won’t go down as my favorite.
4796,1554,4.92,in a nut shell..great beetr!
4797,1554,3.9,thanksgiving at johns
4798,Obsidian Stout,4.71,aroma is extremely enticing roasted malt and espresso with cacao and the body delivers on that promise. a roasted punch loaded with espresso strong cacao very bitter and even a slight minty twinge to it on the back end. probably the best straightforward stout ive had.
4799,Obsidian Stout,5,i like dark beers. i tried coors light...... once. budwieser. shitz. and the cheap ones make me ill. for me the yummy beers are dark darker and darkest. obsidian stout tastes great and is definitely not less filling. im a one and done beer drinker so this one is perfect for me. if this beer isnt sold in germany it should be. i would take this beer over any hefeweizen any day.  i noticed the label on the bottle i have is different from the label on the above photo however the name is the same: deshits its dark and smelly too. it definitely tastes better than the deshits name would suggest. i really like this beer.
4800,Obsidian Stout,4,a very good traditional style stout. pours a dark hue. it has robust rich flavors of dark chocolate roasted malt and licorice. i was fortunate to have it at the brewery itself.
4801,Obsidian Stout,4,rated the same way i do untappd.  poured into a tulip glass.  very dark in color. tan head  coffee and subtle chocolate aroma.  it\s an old school stout. no big adjuncts. big roasty character with espresso notes. but it doesn\t finish with the really assertive coffee bitterness. it finishes a bit more smooth. i think maybe there are some chocolate notes that are helping accomplish that. quite enjoyable. i tried it with some gouda cheese and it worked really well.
4802,Obsidian Stout,4.5,great beer!
4803,Obsidian Stout,3.97,appearance: pours a black cola color with brown hues. a small khaki colored foam head. lacks retention.  aroma: roasted malts peanut shells and bread.  taste: roasted malts and a nice bitter hoppy bite up front coffee molasses and a little bit of chocolate in the middle. slightly biscuity and fades into a milder bitterness that lingers around in the finish.  overall: this is a pretty decent stout. the taste is surprisingly complex for the rather simple aroma.
4804,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.25,poured into a tulip.  pours clear dark brown with garnet highlights. excellent tan foamy head. limited head. excellent lacing.  detectable to strong acidity on the nose with dark fruit and caramel sugar notes. perhaps some orange peel.  the flavor is complex and refined. acidic but not overpoweringly so. excellent balance with sweeter flavors of apple raisin and a bit of oaking. the mature beer portion of this blend is what keeps the restraint just right.  like the flavor the feel is well balanced. not drying but not sticky either. vanishing carbonation. the first few sips have a fair amount; it subsides into tart smoothness quickly.  for my personal taste this brew may be a shade sweet and tame for the style but thats also the level of restraint the brewer was intentionally pursuing. nailed it to say the least.
4805,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.79,poured from the bottle into belgian tulips. its too cold for critical tasting but i didnt want wait. my wife loves sours so ive tried many over the years. l: muddy river water hazy brown not the look id be shooting for but we dont drink beer with our eyes s: beautiful. you can smell the acid forthwith accompanied by caramel or toffee a box of raisins maybe some orange peel t: racy acidity. sour orange raisins and toffee. long sour finish. elegant stuff compared to the kettle sours you find sometimes at brewpubs. not as serious and complex as our best wild ales. somewhere in between. f: appropriate weight. any more malt and it would be a mess. definitely not too thin. o: a fun treat - glad someone came up with this style of beer back in the dark ages. they built some beautiful gothic cathedrals too so maybe not too dark. the acidity of this one is high and more to my wifes tastes - i think i prefer the duchesse one but this is still super fantastic
4806,Rodenbach Grand Cru,3.34,nice deep amber brown colour. smell is vinager mostly balsamic. hard to describe smell and flavour. very vinegar but in a good way still a bit much for me. i may need to try more sours
4807,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.11,330ml bottle into a goblet. my best guess at age is bottled september 2020.  head vanishes quickly lightly sour aroma but the taste is solidly sour with a sweetness in the background. light body and a drying finish
4808,Rodenbach Grand Cru,2.42,appearance: poured with a sliver of head that simply couldnt stick around and produced no lace. the body is a opaque cloudy brown which barely reveals a hint of red when put up to the light which i suppose is appropriate to style but doesnt seem very appetizing to me for some reason.  smell: oh dear...its like some kind on unholy mix of wine apple cider and malt vinegar. i think i am also catching a bit of caramel malt in the background. i will given points certainly of potency as zero warmup needed for that to be produced. ill also give it points for complexity but this is an assault on my olfactory senses. this is a sour at a level that i just cant see liking.  taste: where this beer starts is where id have liked it to end. there is a potent lemon note seemingly barely curbed by some nice notes of cherry and apple but then the beast is let loose as it passed outright into drinking vinegar with some brown sugar thrown into it before this odd dry sand skunkness kind of creeps in over the ruins of that experience. there is identifiable complexity here but the core sour component overshadows it. its like an indy band you like touring with a band that plays with metal nails and a chalkboard.  mouthfeel: the transitioning here starts high and jumps into orbit and is then lost to the solar winds leaving behind acid and sand for us to contemplate. that passes to go back to just a sour lemon note in the aftertaste which would could be present if you didnt experience what caused it. carbonation is also pretty much absent here. theres very little here i enjoy.  drinkability: drinkable like a fancy lemonade made with every bell and whistle except you used half the water and no sugar. way too potent for my liking and the acidic note i mentioned earlier seems to linger at the top of my stomach after it has gone down. at least the low carbonation doesnt further agitate things down there.  final thoughts: i dont think ive ever had a flanders red ale i truly liked but i also dont recall one ever being this potent. i know there are people who enjoy this and that this is their jam. there are notes there that tell me yes this beer is a remarkably complex offering. however for me they are buried under the sour note of this offering. this is very much not for me and didnt even make it pass the half way mark. if you relish in sours this might be for you but this is a hard pass for me.
4809,Rodenbach Grand Cru,3.74,i do not like sours but this is one that got it right. would not consider it sour but “tangy” in a way. initially i felt the smell was of a “nail polish” fragrance but learning that it’s made with “red wine vineger” explains that. definitely would order another if i’m in the mood for a tangy beer.
4810,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.54,when it hit my lips my first words were oh wow ..... appearances can be deceiving because it\s not much to look at.... but a fragrant nose and a great feel along with terrific smooth taste and flavor gives us a big time thumbs up for me
4811,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included.
4812,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,2.66,make your own. it will taste far superior. this isnt horrible but not great either.
4813,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.19,16 ounce can thanks to my friend laura for this one! served in a pint glass the beer pours a light reddish color with about an inch or so light pink head that didnt stick around for too long. small amount of lacing. aroma is nice but also subtle. the brew smells like tomato salt lime and a bit of clamato. taste is similar to the aroma but i do think the clamato and tomato have more of a kick here. theres also a bit of celery and grainy flavors noticeable too. mouthfeel/body is light its easy enough to drink. overall id have to say this is average. its not bad but not great either. ive had other bloody mary/chelada style drinks before and theres others i like a lot more than this. but with that being said this one isnt offensive at all and id drink it again. probably wouldnt buy it for myself though.
4814,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.46,look this is not your homemade michelada. no one should get this expecting the flavors of a high quality bloody mary or something like that. most of these reviews seem to be from lager drinkers who like flavored beer but don\t understand what this is supposed to be. that being said if you want an incredible hangover cure that has more of an msg taste than a salt taste (at least by comparison to a bloody or a homemade michelada) but is well balanced with the acid from the lime and tomato this is your thing. the salt content is there enough that you will taste it but very much more in a way that will make you grab this after a long bike ride rather than a day of sitting around. that being said they\re heavy enough in fill but light enough in alcohol that a couple of these will last you a day of sipping in the sun with no worries about driving home later. all in all as a michelada lover and someone who has developed my own recipe based on tommy sandoval\s this is the one i keep coming back to when i need to remind myself what it\s like this is the base of the flavors that define this cocktail and it is wonderful for what it is. chuck your own couple dashes of hot sauce or cut it with more beer this mich is a utility and i can respect that about it. is it 5/5? no fuckin way but i would challenge you to find a better canned michelada.
4815,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.03,a lot of people are not judging this michelada fairly. this is a great michelada that is a higher abv than most other micheladas on the market. the clamato adds a great flavor profile that is very refreshing and delicious. my only complaint is that it could use some more lime flavor i sometimes add a slice of lime to this and it makes it even better.
4816,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,1.27,this one pours a weird and dead looking light red color with a small head and not much lacing.  this smells like an old fetid tide pool salt warm rain water pepper spice and ketchup.  i don’t know who this is made for but it’s certainly not made for me. the back end is weirdly sweet tomato ketchup type flavors but also with an unpleasant spice to it. i don’t mind a bit of brine in certain beers but it just feels so old and nasty with the clam juice in here.  this is simultaneously super watery but also uncomfortably thick at times with a weird slickness. it just kind of hurts going down.  i could barely stomach about 3oz of this thing. it’s just not my thing not at all. i hate it.
4817,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4,(25 oz can code 19236; purchased cold single... poured into a gibraltar glass)  l: cloudy pinkish liquid; looks like a raspberry wit? but without any foam suds of which explode and vanish on the pour... with subsequent pours the murk gets murkier and some nasty spitty tomato-y foam smears do cling tomato specks abound  s: moderately-intense emanation of tomato juice and limey brine on the nose however little if any clam; smells innocent enough not necessarily off-putting unless you have a depressingly dull diet... certainly has a fresh floral overtone  t: tomato juice mellow undercurrent of grain-soupy adjunct lager light-moderate sea mist barely a kiss of citrus color but a rather forward peppery bite i wasnt expecting... almost a subtle tomato paste-y sweetness around the edges but thankfully not sweetly-flavored like caramel or sugar... pepper and lightly malted tomato nectar prevalent in the aftertaste  f: mildly spritzy carbonation coupled with the peppery bite makes for an enlivening burn/sting upon the tongue/palate mellow heat building an embery fire... take the flavors away and its arguably rather wit-smooth in its textures up front and relatively prickly-hot at the back like perhaps an egregiously coriander-ed extra-triple  o: should i be surprised that i enjoyed and was fascinated by this? - the recipe works well but to my taste id prefer a little more brine and maybe some umami-funk to give it more depth... not sure id quite go gangbusters experimenting on cocktail-ish flavor doctorings with this but i can already think of a variety of ways to accent flavors here: lime wedge(s) (more) clam juice anchovy oleo celery salt spicy mango tequila chaser et al... overtly bloody mary-like noticeably/deliciously malty and applicable within countless culinary scenarios - needs and begs to be paired with charred meats oily carbs spicy fruits etc etc... definitely going back for another - wow! (1639)
4818,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,1.92,blegh. the taste of tomato is so strong it doesnt even taste like tomato. its worse than a v8. it looks decent. but tastes like clam juice. do not drink.
4819,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.74,the best chelada bud makes. you get 25 ounces of tomato based clam beer beverage for $3 what more can you ask for? im an ipa guy but the balance of spice clamato and budweiser creates a vortex of euphoria that smoothly slides down your throat. look is typical of a chelada/michelada; off red/pink with floating bits of tomato. smell is very tomato forward with the typical malt smell of budweiser. taste is amazing a perfect balance of spice and refreshing light beer along with a decently high carbonation this is a great summertime beer..i drink a lot of these after being on the water all day but also make great drinks after skiing too. a great all around beverage
4820,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.32,any flavored beer in a big can you gotta be skeptical. when my friend showed me this beer i couldnt believe what i had been missing. i like budweiser but only on draft at a ballgame. it seems this is a perfect combination. ive mixed my own bud and tomato juice with a little worsteshire and lime its killer as well. but you can get 2 of the 25 oz. for $6 perfect. great for hangovers. i can only drink 2 of them at the most as they taste packed with sodium. then i switch to regular beer. cheers!
4821,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,5,i cant get enough of these red beers ! i have bought out every local storeal around me and it looks like i may have to make my own for a bit ! i wish the distributors would push these a little harder in our area . its typical that you find something you really like and there is a very limited supply ! awesome flavor and i wuld make a permanent place for it in my garage fridge if i could find more than a can or twould at a time !
4822,V.S.O.J.,4.9,#180 yum!
4823,V.S.O.J.,4.57,canned 6/29/21  now this is a special one the highest rated english barleywine on ba vsoj! a long time want of mine i wanted to try it while i have the double barrel vsoj on the way thanks to tavour. i’ve had the og straight jacket and some variants before but this is by far the most exciting. let’s get into it  pours an opaque dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  the nose brings an intense wave of sweetness but it’s balanced out by spicier notes. i’m picking up on aromas of burnt caramel sweet whiskey molasses rye bread golden raisin brown sugar charred oak old leather fig tobacco and sweet toffee  wow everything in taste is kicked up a notch boozy and fruity but not overly sweet. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting fig sweet toffee burnt caramel black cherry molasses dry oak vanilla earthy whiskey and light brown sugar. the swallow brings notes of sweet whiskey charred oak molasses rye bread tobacco raisin brown sugar burnt caramel vanilla old leather and light toffee  a medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a slick beer. finishes a tad sticky and boozy yet still drinks well below the listed 15%  oh yeah this is one hell of a beer. as expected from revolution it’s so much thinner in execution in relation to the flavor. i can’t wait to try the double barrel vsoj next
4824,V.S.O.J.,4.8,oh damn this absolutely lives up to its reputation. nothing unfamiliar in a barleywine here but there is a lot going on and everything is so big. 2-4 years in barrels adds such a layer of... profundity to the already stellar straight jacket. i feel underdressed semi-literate and unwashed sipping on this.  raisins molasses high end whiskey and leather dominate. there is a lot more at the edges though candied nuts honey pipe tobacco and a hell of a lot more. such enveloping deep warmth but not at all hot. people with access to revolution are lucky indeed. thanks so much fbarber!
4825,V.S.O.J.,4.26,12oz can at share. dark brown pour with a foamy beige head. aroma is malty toffee prunes  hint of vanilla. taste is malty leathery sweet caramel light chocolate pit fruit. smooth and strong. aroma of malt chocolate caramel vanilla and bourbon. malty and caramelly flavor with chocolate and raisin leading into a vanilla and bourbon finish. had side by side with straight jacket and this one definitely smelled and tasted more chocolatey and caramelly; more decadent. world class bw.
4826,V.S.O.J.,4.71,pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer.  and what magnificent aromas greet you - rich english toffee vanilla a bit of fig oak and a smidge of booze all in perfect balance. i am literally drooling.  the toffee is forward on the taste as expected but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!) oak (double hurray!) and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% abv).  the mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily as expected. i sat on this a bit and it was more than worth the wait. truly a world class english barleywine.
4827,Summer Shandy,3,having really enjoyed the samuel adams porch rocker of a similar style and really enjoying that i was very let down by this beer. it tasted like lemonheads candy that had been shaken up in a water bottle and then poured into a lager. very watery and artificial tasting.  style: fruit beer | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 4.2% | rating: 3
4828,Summer Shandy,3.14,was looking for something akin to cider only one and after work and its a very rare urge for me. didnt see anything that matched so i went with a 24 oz of this. havent had it in years last i recall was a very artificial pine sol after taste. seems to be gone in the smell pours a hazy big lasting head good retention and lace. tastes sweet with lemon zest i assume to balance on the finish. decent enough.
4829,Summer Shandy,3.17,lemon mixed with a faint weiss beer. good mouthfeel weak smell. overall it’s sippable but not stellar. old lemonade is the most prominent taste. not bad on a hot day though
4830,Summer Shandy,3.39,this is a situational beer. tons of lemon and lemon zest for aroma and taste. nice smooth feel. this shandy is something id be pleased to find at an outdoor party with it is 85+ out or in the fridge after doing yard work. however other than those times when you need something really refreshing (and maybe should be hydrating with something other than a beer anyway) the lemon would probably be too much.
4831,Summer Shandy,3.27,poured from a 24oz can best by july 17th 2023  on a hard pour a good amount of head formed filling most of the glass retention was decent but after getting distracted the head was thin but maintained a cap then i poured the rest. lacing forms at an average rate. very hazy golden yellow body.  aroma is real almost fresh lemon juice which i appreciate a lot actually. a bit of sweet malt sits right behind the fresh lemon aroma bringing a definite sweetness.  taste isnt quite as bright as the aroma eith zero tartness and a zesty lemon flavor that quickly leads into a sweet malty and wheaty but also plain american wheat beer base. essentially zero hops. i want either more beer or more tartness from the lemons. this comes off as a bit sweet but still has a refreshing summery character.  the feel is actually quite nice. outside on a hot day straight out of the can this is fantastic but other than being a fancy easy to drink and maybe even chuggable lawnmower beer it isnt really even worth it to pour in a glass. no wo der they only make it during summer.  overall this beer is very setting dependent. out of the can while outside this is a great radler but out of a glass with dinner its a bit sweet and lacking in tartness for being a lemon radler.
4832,Summer Shandy,3.48,leinenkugels summer shandy 4.2% abv. pours hazy orange with a one-finger white head that mostly dissipated while i struggled with the camera to focus on the damn beer. nose is predictably lemon. taste is lemon faint sweetness slight bitterness. ok mouthfeel overall fair. i left half behind when my takeout order was ready and was relieved not to finish it.
4833,Landshark Lager,2,this is a below average lager. pours a shampoo gold with a bubbly white froth. the nose is non existent as is the case with these garbage brews. no flavor at all.
4834,Landshark Lager,2.8,bought a 6pack of bottles the first 3 were great and then they were rough after that  even for michelada mixing. . . wanted to like these more  but probably wouldnt buy again.
4835,Landshark Lager,2.63,12oz undated bottle unless theres a date on the 6-er i might get back to you on that.  on the pour there was some decent white head that maxed out at 2 fingers although it faded fast. surprisingly above average lacing is left on the sides of my glass. body is golden and light.  aroma is like an exaggerated corona with skunky hops right upfront and a dry but lightly corny malt in the back.  taste is like a watered down and extra sweet killer high life with some of those corona style skunky hops. this beer is very sweet and rhe finish tastes like corn flakes. for the high price it just isn\t good.  feel is filling and syrupy. why does this come off as so sugary? the aroma did not imply it was going to be this full and lingering in the finish. this is closer to heineken than corona and i mean that in a negative way.  overall this was pretty disappointing. not as bad as some true cheapo lagers but the whole selling point of this beer is jimmy buffet and honestly the brew is just as whitewashed and deluded as calling jimmy buffet authentic yucutan music.
4836,Landshark Lager,3,average lager little lacing and a quickly diminishing head. best quality is the clean dry finish which is also to say that is its only quality. average beer.
4837,Landshark Lager,4.95,i have never liked beer but i like to give it a chance a couple times a year. i found this one and gave it a try. i really liked this one so this will be what i will be drinking from now on.
4838,Landshark Lager,2.86,12 ounce bottle no lime. fizzy and yellow saved by a little bit of maltiness. one and done..
4839,Landshark Lager,1.26,you immediately get that strong sicking smell when you open it and it only gets worse from there. it pours yellow and has some sort of nasty lime flavor. tbf id prefer a bud light lime to this. not a good summer beer at all.
4840,Landshark Lager,3.65,16oz can code 22209 (209th day of 2022?) appearance: clear medium straw-gold think but lasting creamy white head moderate lacing.  aroma: very clean and mild cracker and creamed corn no discernable hops  flavor: crackers and cornbread very scant hop low bitterness. clean finish  mouthfeel: light mouthfeel not watery nominal co2 no astringency or other harsh feels. goes down easy. refreshing.  overall: in 2022 landshark delivers on price and flavor clean and inoffensive a solid clean adjunct lager with no unpleasant surprises. much like narragansett.
4841,Landshark Lager,2.25,typical macrolager nothing to write home about. refreshing and light - a good daytime beer.
4842,Landshark Lager,2.74,smells slightly malty. pours clear light gold. taste of light malt and with a hint of lemon. this has a crisp clean flavor but doesn’t really inspire me to purchase another.
4843,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,4.38,sampling a cellar temp 12 oz can of this beer poured into my snifter. canned on 11/09/2020...whoa! didnt notice that when i bought the single.....oh well too late now. part of the online brown ales tasting event. the beer pours a rich cola brown color with a soft pillowy beige head of about 1.5 cm. this foam remains as a sturdy edge layer throughout the sampling. i do get dense short lived lattice on a swirl of my glass. the aroma on this brew is very coffee forward but not astringent much more of a light and sweet coffee note. very roasty and some dark chocolate too. nose is appealing and suits the goal of the beer to mimic cuban coffee. first sip reveals a medium to lighter body with silky smooth texture and soft rolling carbonation. physical traits of this beer are very nice. beer drinks real easy and my glass is almost empty before i finish this review. flavor follows the nose. i get roasted malt and dark chocolate but smooth coffee dominates but is not overly bitter anywhere. definitely a sweeter coffee flavor profile. i really do enjoy this beer even though im not really a coffee drinker. glad to have picked this up and one year in the can. worth a pick up if you see this around even a little less than fresh imo.
4844,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,3.55,33 cl. can october 2021. notes of coffee and chocolate on the nose. delicate toasting. deep brown color dense. abundant creamy and tasty foam. in the mouth the body is extremely drinkable and slides off easily. moderate carbonation. in the mouth the hints of cappuccino dominate (for the delicacy of the toasted hints and creaminess that pervades the taste of the coffee) and of milk chocolate but also of almond walnut and a final sweet touch that almost recalls the whipped cream that is put in some variants of espresso (for example our local moroccan coffee). light malty caramel notes emerge in the background and remain in the background. easy to drink but absolutely satisfying: soft and that releases all the characterizing elements in a decidedly balanced way. perhaps with a slightly more structured body i would have appreciated it even more but considering that it professes itself as a brown ale it is absolutely in line with the structure of the historical british model.
4845,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,3.92,canned october 14th 2020.  pours black but i see some reddish highlights nice finger of tannish foam.  the smell is split between coffee and cocoa nibs with vanilla just behind.  wow the coffee is still prominent even though it is close to being 8 months old. cool. cocoa nibs are almost as noticeable vanilla is there. foremost bitter because of the coffee some malty sweet notes because of the cocoa. i did not expect things turning out this way given the age. its only 5.5%abv.  smooth mouthfeel the carbonation is a tad light at this stage.  very nice.
4846,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,3.78,355 ml can shared by my son steinar. abv is 5.5%. dark brown colour beige head. aroma of coffee and brown malts also notes of chocolate hints of vanilla. slightly sweet flavour with the same ingredients smooth and pleasant to drink.
4847,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,3.74,from a can.
4848,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,3.83,can into glass great undulating tan meringue like head of medium thickness and longevity. very murky dark brown color with golden brunette hue at the edges of glass. charred barrel and coffee aroma anyone ?! a rather thin flavored coffee tinged brown ale with the charred wood showing itself. good
4849,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,4.1,pours deep copper with a 1 inch tan head which dissipates. moderate lacing.  aroma of coffee chocolate wood roast malts.  taste is coffee tobacco chocolate toffee ash. astringent.  full bodied lively carbonation. dry astringent finish.  this is a very good coffee flavored beer.
4850,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,4.07,like the sweet coffee aromatics that emanated from this beer. perfect balance of of abv espresso chocolate and sweetness with a solid carbonation and mouthfeel. great beer.
4851,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,4.06,poured from a 12 oz can dated 11/30/2020 into the test glass. a - mahagony color excellent tight knit mocha cap. foam retention is quite good displaying lovely lacing thoughout the experience. s - espresso cocoa roast malt with a subtle smokiness a kiss of caramel. t- caramel up front then the coffee begins to march in with a milk sugar mixer from the lactose coffee lite on he cream please comes to mind there is also a lovely cocoa bite in there. m - semi sweet start then a move toward the bitter finish is neatral and quite nice o - a very good coffee brown ale. the lactose use is delicate and adds to the heft and texture. really well done
4852,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,3.9,poured from a 12oz can dated 11/09/20 to a nonic. dark brown body with red highlights on the edges of the glass. creamy head really invokes the espresso in the name. aroma is a mild musty malt smell. really faint sense of the coffee to come. taste is a big hit of coffee with a sweet back-bone. there is a sense that the caffeine content is high. medium body with proper carbonation to remind you that youre not drinking a chilled coffee its a brown ale. overall a well executed beer given that the goal was to replicate a certain style of espresso. unfortunately for me its a little sweeter than i like but im not holding that against ccb.
4853,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,4.16,355ml can from curious liquids glasgow (£4.00): deep mahogany with an opaque body thats not far off black & a tan creamy head about 1cm tall that slowly fades to a very fine lacing over the surface. the nose is strong with espresso notes & chocolate upfront its relatively sweet with lactose & sugars coming through on top of an earthy bread malt base that seems quite creamy too. coffee & light roasted malts carry over the to taste with the chocolate sweetness showing as well; its a smooth very creamy beer with some earthy flavours & lactose towards the end. it was medium to full bodied softly carbonated & silky smooth with a great balance too; a solid brown ale that wasnt far off a sweet stout.
4854,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,3.97,my wife picked up this beer for us to try. from a twelve ounce can this one is a dark black color with a thick and frothy head. it is like the crema on an actual espresso. the aroma has a coffee and lightly roasted malt note. the taste is slightly sweet wtih an underlying coffee bitterness and flavor. not bad.
4855,Cubano-Style Espresso Brown Ale,4.21,one of cigar city’s best beers in my opinion. not readily available and i lucked out recently with a six pack. yay.
4856,Cruzcampo Pilsener,5,best drink in spainsuper refreshing and an excellent buy in the small cansnice and cold pick me up on any city walk around spainapparently not well regarded but each to his ownlight and refreshing like spring water perfect to keep you going and much better for your health than sugary pop or energy drinkslove this stuff 10/10.
4857,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.61,330 ml can bought in tenerife. pale golden colour decent head. sweetish fruity and grassy aroma notes of maize (corn) too. flavour is watery and neutral with some tolerable hops in the finish. acceptable as a thirstquencher but not much more.
4858,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.59,this beer is mocked throughout spain and rightly so. only tolerable when drunk ice cold on a blistering hot afternoon in andalusía. as soon as it starts to warm even a tad it becomes sweet & sickly. it labels itself as a pilsner. hmm. a pilsner with no hop character at all. poor.  makes a decent base for a shandy though.
4859,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3.72,surprised this doesnt have better ratings everyone always seems to take things out of context or at least thats my assumption on a lot of global lagers like this i mean against all beer yeah its not a standout but against euro pale types its solid and against much of the rest of the spanish lager scene its quite strong. see its more a pils than a classic pale lager more grain character without the sweetness more crisp at the end some bittering hops in play and overall a fantastic texture thats dry uplifting almost nitro feeling had this on the glacial draft apparently colder than average and it was delightfully clean and refreshing. pretty pour too an inch of permanent and thick white head on top of radiant golden brassy brew lovely clarity. some floral character to the hops as it warms a touch metallic as many of them are here then too but a fast finish nevertheless. decent body to it more of a german malt thing too less cheap tasting than its peers and frankly a delicious little brew that i could have made an afternoon of. i like how it seemed common to serve small pours of this so that constant cold ones could be brought makes awesome sense for outdoor daytime drinking. way way way better than its ratings here in my experience...
4860,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3,pours a clear golden color with a slight head and lacing a-aroma has malts and floral hints t-taste follows the nose with malt and floral flavors m-a light bodied well carbonated beer o-a decent pils
4861,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3.5,on tap. white head with lace. golden color. clear.  earthy and grassy hops. bready and biscuit malts. typical pils flavor. dry and lightly bitter.  light bodied. easy drinking.
4862,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.79,this smells and tastes really like a typical euro lager - tastes like a damp washing cloth tastes rotten but if you drink it quick enough it tastes boozy. this latter is a good point for me. but still for only 40 cents this beer is way better than most of the euro lager crap you get for twice or three times more in hungary... so no complaints - but no praises either.
4863,Tripel Karmeliet,4.66,this is one of the best of the style without question. i let my wife who doesn\t drink beer taste it and she simply said complex. i think she nailed it because its shocking how complex it actually is. loads of clove and some banana apple maybe some peach and an absolute perfect mouthfeel. fluffy white head and it looks like a work of art in its proper glass.  this is easily a top 5 belgian tripel and thats saying something.
4864,Tripel Karmeliet,4.5,fruity belgian character
4865,Tripel Karmeliet,4.38,750ml bottle. date stamp on neck wrapper is 08/12/2023e. green bottle. cloudy straw colored body. huge small bubble head upon pouring which holds for quite some time. left behind is some meringue lacing. aroma is grain malts yeast and fruit - pear peach and lemon. taste is fruity (pear peach apple and lemon) and spicy. yeast funk. wheat tanginess. long lasting aftertaste in a sort of caramel apple sort of way. mouth feel has some heft. very smooth and bubbly. excellent carbonation. very lively and likable beer. complex yet classic. would like to try a fresher example.
4866,Tripel Karmeliet,4.25,the pour is golden yellow with some particles floating around. the taste is green apple banana mild clove & mild white pepper. cheers! a-
4867,Tripel Karmeliet,4.33,l: golden body very even and thick two finger head. s: fruity esters pear and apple floral perfume notes a bit of funk soft and sweet. t: the classic fruity belgian character upfront. fruit esters tart pear medicinal flavors wheat malt white pepper a bit more bitterness in the body than i expected. rich and full tasting but simple. f: moderate carbonation noticeable warmth. o: this tastes old and not in an old bottle way in an old recipe way. i don’t know how else to describe it. the esters and malt are so nicely balanced and not overwhelming. it’s gentle for the style and all the better for it.
4868,Tripel Karmeliet,4.52,i dont know what ive been doing but its definitely fucking around because this is genuinely my first time having this one and yet again in brussels it of course comes in proper glassware!  the head is active as hell so there you can already see how perfectly designed the glass is because it contains it top to bottom while the body is a sparklingly clear wedding band gold.  taste is more floral than i expect out of a tripel which is unique to me while still featuring some gently peppery phenols as well as some citrus peel and a touch of minerality. its actually more beautifully bright of fruity characteristics like stonefruit but also honeysuckle. its incredible.  tripel karmeliet is one of most wonderfully expressive tripels ive ever had and i regret not having had one of these ages ago. this could have changed my perspective of belgian ales so drastically and so much sooner. hands down this is the best tripel on earth.
4869,Tripel Karmeliet,4.49,a: some chill haze on this burnt yellow color. huge 3-4 finger off white rocky head  s: sweet grains grass lemongrass band aid and some barn yard funk. huge note of pear and green apple skin. clove and cardamom. pepper and a nice crusty bread backbone  t: sweet grains grass and lemongrass...just like the nose. big pear and green apple skin behind that. cardamom and pepper follow along with a nice crusty loaf of country bread. pepper and some belgian yeast spice. a hint of banana and more grains  m: medium mouthfeel with high carbonation  o: world class tripel right here. great earthy notes with a kiss of funk and grains
4870,Tripel Karmeliet,4.2,330ml. bottle in vientiane laos. pours a caramel brown with a good white retentive head. aromas of yeast smoke and spice. a fruity and yeasty taste. complex and pleasant. a good tripel.
4871,Doppelganger,4.49,pint can poured into a stemmed tulip ipa glass.  murky thick apricot colored creamsicle. 1-plus f white cap with waves of lacing.  juicy citrus and tropical fruit aromas. pineapple orange and grapefruit. it’s dank and dry.  positive juice flavors follow the aromas. soaked malt with citrus variety led by grapefruit.  dense yet flowing juice feel. the sweetness come through the hops and kicks out bitterness. full and smooth.  strong neipa version.
4872,Doppelganger,4.59,from a 16oz can dated 11/15/22 into a tulip. can message: keep cold drink fresh ba description says 8.2% abv. can says 8%.  pours an opaque brownish orange with about one finger of white head. great retention excellent lacing.  major aroma alert: pineapple oranges mandarins melon and juicy fruit gum.  juicy taste-big juicy taste. maybe not as distinct as the nose. citrus juice pineapple. also some citrus rind bitterness. light earthy notes. incredibly well-balanced juice and bitterness.  soft but thick full-bodied mouthfeel. balanced bitterness and juice aftertaste. low to medium carbonation.  wow. great one right here folks. loving it.
4873,Doppelganger,4.37,pours a hazy orange yellow color. super juicy tropical flavors and about as dank as tree house gets outside of the bright series. slightly floral with a subtle grapefruit taste. its smooth and silky as most tree house hazies end up being. very above average beer.
4874,Doppelganger,4.66,poured from a 16oz can into pint glass in october 2022. there was a canned date of 04/19/22 @ 05:59:33 on the bottom of the can. i bought this at the brewery and drank about 2 months from purchase.  appearance: deep gold color with 2-finger white head. it is deep with a very hazy complexion like many new england ipas. head is very thick and it lasts a minute leaving a small covering. there is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.  smell: strong aroma of citrus and pine as well as some hops and pineapple. the citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.  taste: bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. the sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. overall a nice balance and very drinkable.  mouthfeel: medium body. average alcohol which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.  this is an excellent new england ipa. it has a nice mix of citrus hops and other flavors which makes it enjoyable. another outstanding ipa from tree house. i like the overall balance and would buy this again.
4875,Doppelganger,4.66,poured on 5/7/2022 from a 16oz can that was purchased at the brewery on 4/29/2022 into a tulip glass.  a: the beer is a very hazy dark gold color with a large white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  s: the aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.  t: the taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. then a strong but not over-powering floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. the malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. the after-taste is hoppy and sweet.  m: very crisp and very smooth light-to-medium body medium carbonation finish is clean for the style.  o: very tasty goes down extremely easily not too filling well-disguised kick very good representation of style this is an excellent 2neipa to drink for a very long time.
4876,Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.71,all high abv porters should be bourbon barrel aged in my opinion. this one is and well done. super dark in color with a light brown head. nose is bourbon and caramel. taste is like toasted cane sugar and caramel. the slight burn from the abv is not overwhelming yet has a bit of hang around power. the feel goes all the way down the esophagus.
4877,Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.67,9/2/2018
4878,Saison-Brett,3.77,750 ml bottle vintage 2013 probably from vinmonopolet. abv is 8.5%. pale golden colour only slightly hazy. huge and lasting white head. lovely aroma of saison yeast and brett with fruity and peppery notes hints of farmhouse. medium sweet but still quite crisp flavour with peppery notes distinct bittering hops.
4879,Saison-Brett,4.01,an acidic but fruitful saison. has a very relaxed aftertaste that is warm and fresh. the energy aroma is better than it’s taste but still an excellent beer.
4880,Saison-Brett,4.31,appearance: pours a hazy yellow-orange thick fluffy head great retention. inviting indeed would love it if the head was not just plain white. lacing is quite good nothing crazy though. smell: hop backbone citrusy namely orange and grapefruit. notes of brett and pepper. taste: balanced. the citrusy hops mingle well with the brett notes. hop bitterness is low. brett peppery and citrusy hops are at the top. the finish has a nice malty tinge and tastes of alcohol. as it gets warmer the pepper notes really come through like tank 7. mouthfeel: effervescent burn light bodied soft crisp refreshing smooth enough dry. it touches the lips and tongue with a gentle caress. overall: first off...its not tank 7...and thats to be expected! its a lovely beast of its own and its well invited. i have another already to drink down the road in a few years...but i may get another for my birthday next year. so good!
4881,Saison-Brett,3.89,had a 2011 bottle back in september 2015. bottle # 12235.  pours a darker golden color hints of mild cloudiness and with a big ol\ full on head exceeding 1. aroma imparted notes of grain alcohol hay rawhide pepper and bitter melon.  taste allayed my fears about this being too big and an imperial saison. 8.5% is too big normally but somehow this kept its style guideline roots. mouth feel stayed relatively dry and light instead of dropping an oppressive amount of alcohol. more lemon tartness in the taste than aroma. a little bit of other citrus beyond that a pear note and a pineapple note. minimal band aid phenol funk notes. even though it was 4 years old it didn\t seem much different than fresher pours i\ve had of it.  at the end of the day its a very good beer but the price point (around $20) is such that i dunno how often i can buy a bottle of it. a pour on tap sure knock it out every time. but a bottle that is sometimes tough because you can get other ones for half the price.
4882,Saison-Brett,4.38,2018 on tap. into tulip  original rating from notes pulled from inter-dimensional memorial travel through millions of miles of space and time away: 4.25 across the board  oh lawd this takes me back. wish i could get this in a 2008.  slight amber haze with one-finger tight ivory sticky foam head.  upfront barnyard funk sweet n’ sour lemon citrus. slight caramel and multigrain bread coming through. fresh scythed meadow outside of stull ks. lovely  not the same as i remembered but pretty close. great big funky citrus lemon peel and orange pith. brett comes swinging through with the proto-funk like herbie hancock on a headhunt. piss-soaked horse blanket that i chewed on in a dream. splendid.  a bit tame on draft compared to the errant eruption of yesteryear. still fizzy and bubbly champagney(?). slight drying with a balanced malt sweetness.  an og in my book. just a young buck but man was this a trip when i first had it. several times since and i stick with my ratings. you know what? bump that taste and feel up a notch. worth a shot.
4883,Saison-Brett,4.37,boulevard saison brett 2016 8.5% abv. pours hazy bright orange with a foamy white 5+ finger head that left heavy lacing. nose is grassy malty pepper leather (belt not shoe) with slight funk. taste has lemon zest a mashup of other fruits pepper dry and slightly bitter. there is a lot more going on with taste than i can describe. outstanding mouthfeel heavier carbonation but not unpleasant. overall world-class.
4884,Saison-Brett,4.49,2016 vintage  pours slightly hazy amber gold with a lasting foam head. the smells are slightly malty saisony and earthy funky filled with brettanomyces. notes of caramel honeydew melon green banana sweet clove spice peppercorn funky leather earthy brett notes rubber tire dried fruit with floral earthy hops. tastes pretty nice clean honeydew melon green banana plantain notes tart lemon mild apple peppercorn clove spice some funky earthy brett notes like sweet leather rubber tire dried fruit apricot caramel vanilla bready malts with floral herbal hops. feels medium lighter bodied creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. overall a nice aged brett saison.
4885,Saison-Brett,4.21,2017 vintage. poured into a nonic. cloudy amber. massive bubbly head that sticks around to the end. lots of sticky lacing. awesome nose. fruity aroma with some mild barnyard. a very nice start. fruity up front changing to clean barnyard with a long peppery finish. light body. overall an outstanding saison.
4886,Pirate Bomb!,4.15,black in color with no penetration to light. there’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and and covering a third of the top. the aroma is of chilies rum and coffee. i’m tasting chilies vanilla cacao and rum. the mouth is warm from the chilies and otherwise chewy.
4887,Pirate Bomb!,3.61,12 oz. bottle marked 07/27/19 sampled 05/09/21. a little long to wait bought it off the shelf 3 weeks ago so the brewer takes any hits on aging they left it there for purchase.  appearance: black glass thin halo of tan bubbles no lacing.  aroma: heavy vegetative chili note burned barrel some underlying malt sweetness.  taste: medicinal alcohol green pepper some sweetness comes in deep into the taste a little coffee in the finish. hard to get many beer flavors out of this even imperial stout flavors. some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit.  mouthfeel: medium heavy body low almost flat carbonation little oily in the finish but pretty clean.  overall: i love prairie bombs ive enjoyed a lot of the variations this one not so much. i think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer and it just comes across as a little gimmicky. the vegetable note really throws me. maybe this one sat too long the date code is all but invisible on the bottle.
4888,Pirate Bomb!,4.99,fantastic! the rum taste really comes thru.
4889,Pirate Bomb!,4.44,on tap at cardinal pub & bar stavanger. pitch black colour low tan head. aroma first of fusel alcohols then molasses rum oak cask vanilla coconut chocolate and roast malts. rich and warming mouthfeel. outstanding flavour medium sweet and roasty no sign of fusel otherwise all the delicious notes from the aroma are repeated and strengthened here. nice chili heat in the finish. perfect!
4890,IPA,4,served up in a pint. sparky and sting notes of pine and grapefruit. taste is chewy and strongly fresh and bitter with a thick middle and a heavy bitter finish. very good.
4891,IPA,3.8,poured from a 12oz can  on the pour 3 fingers of white well supported head were present that forms nice damage. body is a deep deep gold with super fine carbonation rising up.  aroma is super bright and happy with an overhanging darkness. bright floral fruity and dank with a sweet malt. not the most balanced.  flavor is more balanced than the aroma and the malt comes off as less sweet. there is a piney and slightly citrus hop note up front that slowly builds in bitterness and darkness. solid slightly sweet and bread malt backbone. some herbal hops are present as well i realized.  feel is very full and verging on heavy. the malt is mouthcoating and the hops are too. not overwhelming but very full with a slight hint of alcohol.  overall this is pretty good but id argue not quite world class. could be crispier and the hops could have a more focused flavor. probably best to go into this expecting an imperial english ipa because this has some english hop vibes as well.
4892,IPA,4.27,from pilgrim’s market in cda idaho - 12 ounce can (i really wish 12 ounces was still standard packaging). pours a slightly chill hazed bright golden with two plus fingers of foamy white head. clear golden as warms. nose of citrus mango and bit of bready malt - as warms bursts with the mango and over ripe orange; piney with floral notes. tastes initially of sweet bready malt tropical fruit and ripe orange. piney and herbal bitterness follow with hints of grapefruit and resin at the back of the palate. medium mouthfeel nicely carbonated with a smooth drying bitter finish.
4893,IPA,4.25,12oz can. date stamp on bottom lip looks to be 09/27/23 but is more likely 03/27/23 because of the hour:minute stamp included. clear pale gold colored body. one thick finger of white head and this turns into a thin cap and high ring. leaves behind some wide rings of lacing. aroma of citrus and pine. pine grapefruit and resin bitterness. taste follows the nose with orange grapefruit and pineapple joined by pine resin bitterness. a little sweet but with a bitter tail end. very good toasted malt base. medium mouth feel with a touch of nectar. clean and drying finish. some tongue numbing. excellent carbonation. classic west coast ipa with enough juice to be thirst quenching.
4894,IPA,4.28,from a stovepipe as mother nature intended. pours like a classic wcipa with a generous cap of foam on top. light aroma with a touch of pine and a little floral note. the malt doesn’t assert itself leaving it crisp on the finish.
4895,Molson Canadian Light,1.02,wasnt even going to write a review on this until i was a few sips in. just wait. anyway three tall boys of this swill was gifted to me by an uncle who won some in store credit to the tune of around $500 on some truck stop game machines. thanks man.  look - transparent yellow without a head and an assload of carbonation. no stick.  smell - heres where things really get fun. absolutely astringent in every sense of the word. all reference to beer was filtered from this thing and replaced with leftover industrial cleanser.  taste - if youve read the scent you already understand the taste. bitter as all get out to boot.  feel - heavily carbonated like champagne on steroids and far too thick bodied for its own good. swallow induces the gag reflex and nearly makes you spit up the beer.  overall - absolutely atrocious in every sense of the word. figured this was going to be another generic light lager without a frill that scored in the mid 2s and forgotten by tomorrow morning. instead i will remember this for all the wrong reasons. a light lager...hell any adjunct lager style is supposed to be easy going and poundable without a care in the world. this thing fails in every single regard aside from maybe the appearance. up there with steel reserve and labatt maximum ice in terms of worst tasting beers ive ever had the displeasure of consuming. any other light lager you can grab at a supermarket is like a tipa compared to this. seriously. even something as putrid as natural ice tastes like heaven compared to this.  edit as of 2/20/18. tried to drink another one. absolutely terrible. sweaty and chokingly bubbly. guess the rest go to my neighbor.
4896,Molson Canadian Light,2,not good at all. has a strange taste up front then a strange aftertaste.
4897,Molson Canadian Light,2.75,molson canadian light lager 4% - clear pale yellow gold color with a frothy white cap of foam thin light lager aroma and taste with mild corn and grains. thin but refreshing! cheers!
4898,Molson Canadian Light,2.25,a-pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing a-aroma has slight grain hints t-the taste follows the nose with a slight grain flavor m-a light bodied decently carbonated beer o-a mediocre lager
4899,Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,whale hunting  brewers notes: collaboration with j. wakefield brewing  we took our original j. wakefield collaboration affogato imperial stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our hudson road barrel house. affogato imperial stout is inspired by a few of our brewers favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) barringtons affogato.  barrel aged affogato imperial stout is decadent rich and full. brewed with a blend of barrington & mostra beans affogato leads with aromas of vanilla toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. barrel aged affogato has a full satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream hot cocoa rich brownie batter with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.  malt: american 2-row barley crystal 120 flaked oats black malt chocolate malt munich malt white wheat malt brown sugar dark candied syrup lactose hops etc: columbus barrington and mostra coffees madagascar vanilla beans  on tap at trillium canton 5oz snifter  black motor oil  thin dark brown big bubbled layer quickly settles to a ring  aroma is cocoa brown sugar bourbon and yes brownie batter  taste is bourbon cocoa brownies coffee  fizzy mouthfeel  rich decadent  13.8% abv this is a sipper  good beer
4900,Oude Gueuze,3.36,look - orange syrup not head ing lacing smell - very earthy tart citrus grainy slight chemical taste - funky dry earthy grainy feel - medium body light carb slight syrup overall - this must be old and wonder how much better it could.be young
4901,Oude Gueuze,3.84,12.7oz corked and caged bottle. dating badly smudged but at least 4 years old.  looks okay in the glass. hazy dull orange body. head dissipates very quickly no lacing.  somewhat funky on the nose even a little cheesy. barest hint of green apple.  on tasting a little dry quite sour. mild funk more green apple than the nose suggests.  mouth barely reaches medium finish a lasting dry sourness spikes of bitterness now and then.  overall has its merits but not as good as i was hoping for. cork was a bit grubby on the edges perhaps a mild contamination issue?
4902,Oude Gueuze,4.25,12.7oz green corked & caged bottle notched bottled in d 2016 (nearly 6 years old) poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 6% abv. the beer pours mostly bright soft medium amber in color with short lived nearly white head. the head recedes to a few scattered bubbles about the perimeter of the glass. no lacing. the aroma is intense (like you can smell it while taking the picture) lemon orchard fruit horse blanket funky cheese and vinegar. the taste is sour overwhelming so to my palate but i dont generally care for sour beer. digging past my initial instinct to quit this bottle immediately i get waves of citrus big vinegar and funky ass bleu cheese. mouthfeel is thin bodied highly carbonated and bone dry. overall i will capitulate to the ba overall rating of world class for a lambic gueuze and rate it accordingly. however i would not serve this to a sworn enemy dying of thirst...
4903,Oude Gueuze,4.27,12.7oz green bottle. label has bottling date as d (december) 2018. cloudy pale amber/apricot colored body. brief off white head. no lacing. aroma is leather and grass. very fragrant. like its body color there is a hint of stone fruit apricot. taste is sour with tobacco and leather flavors. also some cut hay. there is the apricot fruit here. the intensity mellows in the aftertaste with a hint of fruit and oak remaining. tart mouth feel with a drying sensation. very good carbonation. somewhat like a sour white wine but still somewhat complex.
4904,Oude Gueuze,4.21,sample from bottle at rbnag 2014 halden grand tasting. golden colour. lovely brett aroma lemony and farmhouse notes. even better sour flavour with loads of brett and lemony notes.
4905,Oude Gueuze,4.39,bottled: april 2016  l: pours a deep gold with light to light-medium haze. a slightly aggressive pour produces a white 2 finger head with some slight retention. after about 2 minutes the head has faded to a 3 mm ring around the circumference of the glass while the middle of the glass has a thin splotchy sheet of bubbles.  s: lots of lemons a hint of green apple acetic acid and some earthy and woody funk.  t: i get lemons riding throughout the whole palate with the barnyard funk coming in mid palate and riding to the back end. the back end is the aforementioned lemons and funk but accented by some green apple oak and a hint of earth. the finish is pleasantly tart.  f: light to light-medium body with medium-light carbonation. the mouthfeel is prickly with a bit of dryness on the finish.  o: complex and well balanced between the fruit and funk with a bit of oak to tie it all together. one of the better gueuzes i have had the opportunity to try. if iambics are your thing this is highly recommended.
4906,Oude Gueuze,4.3,blend of 2016 2017 and 2018 lambics so this was likely blended in 2019  new year new beer! im very excited to try my first gueuze and planned to open it for new years day 2021 (more like new years night at this point). lets just jump straight into this  pours a cloudy orange gold with just a thin white cap that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing the carbonation is very visible  a lot of fruit and funk dancing around in the nose. i get notes of apricot underripe peach lemon horse blanket sharp oak sweet malt and a small touch of tobacco oddly enough for a beer like this  the flavor evolves quite a bit throughout the sip here. what starts off smooth and balanced in sweet and sour turns into a funky dry tartness. it starts with notes of lemon white grape crisp but full malt and buttery oak that reminds me of chardonnay. the swallow brings notes of sharp oak leather tart and funky apricot apple skin vinegar and a light floral character  a light body pairs with moderate carbonation for a very refreshing drinking experience. it feels light than the abv but finishes a touch too sticky  this was a damn good beer and im happy to have tried the style! i know theres better ones out there and id love to have more. happy new years ba cheers to a better 2021!
4907,Oude Gueuze,3.88,l: crystal clear amber color massive four finger but quickly dissipating white head no lacing to speak of good carbonation.  s: fruity sour.  t: fruity lemony sour quite smooth very dry.  f: medium bodied nicely flavored smooth.  o: nice sour.
4908,Game Day Light,1.41,the best way to describe game day light is to use simple words as this is a simple beer. the flavor can be best described as musty. the carbonation is overbearing and chafing to the mouth. the aroma is of overly ripe fruit (grapes or plums). it has a strong head... which burns out to reveal the aforementioned molten carbonation.  however when purchased for a song at 3.99 usd for a twelve pack of cans or even at a slightly higher 5.99 usd it can be a pleasure to drink like water and a painful tincture to imbibe quickly. i can personally attest that after nearly drinking a pallet of this beer it can liven up a party with a lack of beverages very quickly.  if you have to have a beer which you can enjoy taste-wise and you are tight on cash look elsewhere. a malt liquor might simply be a better choice. if you need a beer that will ensure some intoxication at a decent price this is probably a poor choice but it is an option which can be exercised.
4909,Game Day Light,2.09,pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. smell is of malt grain grass and nail polish remover aromas. taste is much the same with watery malt and fruit flavors on the finish. there is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. this beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. overall this is a poor beer that lives up to the light name with some watery and bland flavors.
4910,Game Day Light,2.65,poured very pale gold into a shaker pint glass. three fingers of white head. head becomes a ring toward the bottom. a nice sheet of fine lacing on one side of the glass. smells slightly grainy. taste is sweet and very light. a bit like that sparkling cider that non-drinkers buy for champagne substitute only very watered down. no real hop presence detected. mouthfeel was thin but o.k. on the carbonation. overall a beer that was worth every penny of the $2.99 for the 12-pack. a great beer for the people that dislike hops or anything bitter. cheaper than coke pepsi and most bottled water. works out to 25 cents per beer. wow.
4911,Game Day Light,1.98,note:: im giving this beer a fair chance. i didnt even look at previous or average ratings.  a: very light yellow... like a stained antique newspaper youd find in an old writing desk.  s: smells like champange.... sparkling white wine... whatever you want to call it but it smells exactly like a brut.  t: very light and lacking any sort of depth. sort of tastes like watered down grape juice. i dont know where the beer is in this. honestly. tastes just roll off the tounge too quickly im going to say it tastes a little like lemon sprite white grapes and poland spring water. tastes a little bit like perfume too in a bad way.  m: legitimately not even there. in all fairness im sure they were going for the taste of perfumed water but its just not acceptable.  o: im sure my biases kicked in and told me to reject the light macro beer before me but i really did give it a chance. im probably not going to finish the can esspecially knowing i have other beers in the fridge. i could only drink this if i were dying of thirst. simple.
4912,Game Day Light,1.89,from 24 fl. oz. can no. 0750-2004. sampled on june 6 2011. the pour is straw pale yellow with a lot of fizzy white head at first that bubbles down quickly like a soft drink. the aroma is made up of adjuncts like corn and rice and virtually no malts or hops to speak of. the body is very thin like water. the taste is quite intolerable with a flat adjunct-laden chemical-type character although there are some hops on the tail end...just barely. this one is weaker than its regular beer sibling.
4913,Game Day Light,1.82,the canquest (tm) has morphed into an all-cansuming focus for me in which i will simply drink any beer that comes in a can. i have reviewed some oddities before but beer from 7-11?!? ah the memories of the mid-1970s. when we did not have a nearby 7-11 and had to wait for the annual jersey shore trip to load up on their marvel comics slushee cups ... how my rents ever put up with sucking those things down remains beyond my ken. we had a 7-11 in lancaster at james and water sts. for a short while but those days are long gone. sos my pops in a random memory of the late-70s on labor day weekend taking my brother and i for the ice cream cookies that were sandwiched between oatmeal cookies and covered in chocolate after watching several hours of the jerry lewis mda telethon.  crack & glug time: my aggressive pour netted me two fingers of foamy bone-white head that lasted about as long as the foam at high tide at the shore. long beach island in case you wondered. the haven beach motel in beach haven run by mr. flynn of flynn real estate llc. now where was i? oh my but the nose had the grapiness of the g. d. ice. ouch and ooof. that along with a metallic tang gets it an epic fail. zounds! the color was a pale lemon-yellow with ne-quality clarity. mouthfeel was thin and the taste was present but unobtrusive. it was just bland as all get-out. it had a light bitterness but noting beyond that. booooring! not bad but more towards why bother? 110 calories? im switching back to corona light! my buff figure cant handle this.
4914,Game Day Light,1.48,7/11 special. pours a very pale clear yellow with a huge airy white head. head fell relatively slow to just about nothing. no real lace.  has a clean cereal and medical aroma. not very inviting.  taste is thin and again medical with a pronounced sweetness. watery.  very thin and watery mouthfeel with a slight tingle on the tongue.  not good at all. taste is really weak and really strange. mass produced with cheap ingredients. avoid.
4915,Game Day Light,2.01,the appearance is pale gold with a medium head that fades to nothing. the aroma is almost non existent hints of sweet malt and corn with a touch of chemicals. the taste is like the aroma but not disgusting. the palate is thin. overall this is pretty much what i expected.
4916,Game Day Light,2.11,served in a coca-cola flared pint glass.  while visiting a nearby 7-11 i found myself face-to-face with this oddity. i was compelled to purchase and give it a go. it pours a ridiculously clear very pale straw topped by a quickly-disappearing finger of white fizz. giving the surface a deep sniff this beer has the same problem my boy phil fry once suffered from: it has no nose. i wanna say theres some watered-down corn syrup but that could just be the air in my apartment (i think my air conditioner has issues). but yeah i smell nothing here as though water were sitting in the glass. hm. a taste yields some of that suspected corn syrup (swimming in what seems like an ocean) along with a hint of rice and a slight tinniness (im assuming from the can). there isnt much here to be objectionable but thats mainly cause there aint much here to begin with. the body is infused with helium with barely any carbonation and a very watery feel. like ive said before it mostly seems like water. i have a sneaking suspicion 7-11s screwing with me by selling me a can of flavored water instead of an actual beer. oh well at least it goes down quick and easy. boo this beer.
4917,Game Day Light,1.27,24 oz man can\ for 99 cents at a gas station in joliet.  a - yellow and fizzy.  s - corny and grainy. smells a bit off like slightly stale cereal or wet grains.  t - whew. not good. corn sour old socks and tart old nasty lemonade.  m - light over-carbonated.  d - not as bad as game day ice but still not even close to decent.
4918,Game Day Light,2.52,a - poured a clear straw color with a white head that fades after a minute of two to nothing  s - has a very corny and sweet malt nose  t - for what it is its really not all that bad below average yes but its a cheap light lager sweet corny malt without much to it  m - this beer has a light body with medium high carbonation to it  d - while this isnt the first id buy to take to the pool or a bbq for what it is its not horrible if i ever get laid off again and become poor again i could see this being a regular in the fridge
4919,Game Day Light,1.2,i picked this up in 24oz cans from 7-11.  appearance: very pale yellow color with a huge white head which stayed around longer than its ice counterpart.  smell: corn and malty sweetness. at least no cat pee.  taste: there really is no taste to it. im really trying here to detect something but... i got nothing.  mouthfeel: very high carbonation but very thin and watery body.  overall: i tried. thats really all i can say. this beer has no value to add to the current beer market. not even those who drink the big boys bmc stuff will appreciate this one because there is nothing to appreciate about this beer. i predict that this beer wont last very long.
4920,Hop Nosh IPA,4,12 oz cold can poured into a pint glass. orange-ish with a fine white foam. laces well. aroma of citrus and a little dankness. taste matches with a welcome sweetness and a clean finish. medium body medium carbonation. overall a right fine every day west coast ipa.
4921,Hop Nosh IPA,4.05,poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass; no known birth date. pours darkish yellow with good foamy head. good mix of bitter hops with plenty of malt backing. semi-dank. good.
4922,Hop Nosh IPA,3.99,uinta hop nosh ipa (bottle) a: pours an amber body with small white head with nice retention and lacing s: slight flower citrus rind smell; pretty nice t: nice citrusy earthy taste with subtle sweet toffee notes m: medium bodied and smooth d: nice feel and taste combo; very good beer overall
4923,Hop Nosh IPA,4.03,based on my fairly unkind perception of hop noshs expression back in 2015 i find it absolutely necessary to delete my old review and reevaluate now as that opinion just does not apply anymore largely in terms of my own palate preferences and overall experiential evolution.  lightly foggy orange-amber--just about as hazy as hazy nosh ironically enough--with a moderately short off-white head leaving substantial but fluid lacing that falls back down to the surface in slo-mo.  a solid west coast ipa with plenty of citrus and pine working in concert its quite a bit more bitter and dank than their hazy obviously but without all that limey juiciness instead exhibiting some catty hints in the exhale. however its quite clean up front and stunningly reminds me of the sort of prickly resins often found in fat heads stellar ipa program although paired with a lesser hint of dampening graham.  the moderate body has a gently expanding carbonation and finishes just dry.
4924,Hop Nosh IPA,4.25,great go-to west coast ipa
4925,Hop Nosh IPA,4.15,poured from a 12 oz can into a sixpoint can glass  the beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties. kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color... about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing.  lots of citrus fruits in the aroma as well as some pineapple mango and papaya. mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness.  like the aroma the flavor is orange papaya mango with a nice bready toasty malt character. great balance. medium bodied and slick on the tounge. a bit heavier than most ipas definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast ipa style but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast ipa  overall a very good beer that i would would be happy to see on tap or on the shelf.
4926,Hop Nosh IPA,3.91,12 oz can pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of large bubbles leaves some lacing in my glass. fresh grapefruit and pine aromas hoppy citrus and pine flavors. medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel finishes dry.
4927,Blatz Beer,4.05,thought it was gonna be terrible like i remember it to be last time i drunk it out of a returnable case 14 years ago. was pleasantly surprised that it was refreshing and has a nice little kick to it. much better than expected . my usual go to beer miller genuine draft is getting harder and harder to find. this is also $2 cheaper per case. only drawback is ill never find it on vacation in las vegas.
4928,Blatz Beer,3.49,remember the heavy returnable cases? local store had this in stock with those that looked the same as those from the early 90’s. just had to get one for old times sake. just a basic beer to have on a saturday afternoon. no complaints.
4929,Blatz Beer,3.47,please delete if you choose to do so. trigger warning: the last time i drank a delicious can of blatz beer was around 1979 so in some respects this review is for historical reasons only.  my local beer shop on state street in madison wisconsin sold blatz way back when. i bought several 12 packs over the course of a few months and walked home 2 to 3 miles with the 12-pack on my shoulder back to my apartment on spring street.  back then blatz was a welcome alternative to the national and regional beers available at the time. it wasnt promoted or expected to be all-star or world class just a solid brew that you might prefer to old style schmidt miller etc  all good things come to an end. after 8-10 six-packs i got tired of the taste and moved on to other brews. i remember the store clerk telling me that they had blatz beer on sale for xx dollars. didnt matter i was tired of the beer.
4930,Blatz Beer,3.66,blatz is a well rounded beer that goes down easy. under rated i believe because of its limited availability.
4931,Blatz Beer,3.46,hard to find around me . usually pick it up at reisbacks in zanesville oh . my uncles drank the hell out of this back in the 80s . kind of sweet an light bodied for a non lite aal. just has a better taste than some of my other cheap go -tos. like i said  you just dont see it around central ohio everyday  and its always the cans  you never see the little brown bottles anymore.
4932,Blatz Beer,3.8,pours a standard translucent gold with a fluffy white head thats thinner than expected and dissipates relatively quickly. it smells slightly sweet but has a very thick barley forward smell with a hint of grassy hops and a touch of wet corny sweetness. the taste is fuller than expected with a bigger malt presence than most and has a slightly hoppy edge to keep it from being sweet. its thicker feeling without being thick like a schlitz or a non adjuncted lager. it goes down like a light lager but its not. overall the sum is greater than its parts on this one. pick it up if you want to drink something youve never had before.
4933,Blatz Beer,3.34,at fifty cents per can blatz is a fine covid-19 low-cost adult beverage. decent light lager taste good carbonation. expect this to be a great summer quaff
4934,Blatz Beer,3.03,drank from a 12 ounce can. scores are based on the style.  look - the logo is incredibly attractive but the can as an ensemble isnt that great. the silver color doesnt draw me in and the tessellated little blatz words across the can just clutter things up.  smell - very faint metallic sweetness. maybe some grape? not much there.  taste - the first thing that comes to mind is cream soda. somewhat vanilla sweetness but even with its lightness it still begs for some bitterness to round it out.  feel - thin body with a pleasant amount of fizz. goes down quite easy.  overall - i was hoping to find a new hipster-y grandpa beer to love but this one is pretty lame. not bad nor good i dont know when ill get back to it after this.
4935,Blatz Beer,2.8,part of my old school macro rotation. mouth feel is very light as is beer taste mild carbonation and very little aftertaste. good summer beer - excellent on a hot day cold with a burger or sandwich. can knock a bunch of these down get a cool buzz and not feel it the next day. always a plus.
4936,Blatz Beer,3.85,12 ounce can into lager glass best before 10/14/2019. pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with solid retention that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. light spotty lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. good appearance. aromas of cracker corn white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood peppercorn and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. a bit too fruity corn aromas but not overwhelming. nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. taste of cracker corn white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood peppercorn and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. light herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood peppercorn and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. fairly crisp/clean finishing. very clean on lager flavors with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. overall this is a delicious pale adjunct lager. all around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. very flavorful and not watery for the abv. great clean pils malt/grain showcase with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. not overdone on adjuncts. minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. a very enjoyable offering and outstanding style example. one of the better aal ive had as expected of pabst.
4937,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.96,l: dark pitch black as it should be with no light at all. looks very thick. s: dark chocolate dark coffee roast some faint dark fruit and bourbon barrel age is well hidden. t: absolutely heavenly and smooth with the flavors mentioned under the smell. does not feel like an 11% abv beer yet you get the effects afterwards. f: thick smooth and luscious. overall: this is the best imperial stout that ive had and its not even close. i first had this in 2021 during the warm weather months and its truly better than even kbs.
4938,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,very good head production but retention is lacking fading to only the thinnest possible ring around the rim of the glass before long. body is a lovely obsidian hue cola-like along the edges.  aroma is quite strong prominently featuring the bourbon. notes of bourbon mash brown sugar oak leather red grape cherry coconut syrup.  flavor absolutely delivers on a classic bcbs-like bba imperial stout. lots of bourbon but not overpowering; moderate char; bitter but not overly hoppy nor too roasty coming across on the more restrained side of ris. toffee ginger cookies raisin coffee prune bourbon oak leather white pepper blackstrap molasses.  exceptionally easy to sip savor and chew despite the abv and barrel influence. does finish fairly hot on the back third letting you know just how big it is.  this is an excellent ba ris with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts. its supremely drinkable and less rich than most others without sacrificing flavor. that said i personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness. i also favor ais over ris which certainly influences my take on this one.
4939,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.23,plead the 5th from dark horse brewing. 12 oz can. stored at 34 degrees at home. received from @whyteboar in nbw bif #16. reviewed 05/12/22. note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. undated can. served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 57.7 degrees. appearance – 3.5. first pour – amber brown (srm 18) clear. body – brown (srm 20) opaque. under direct light same. when rear lite opaque except at the edges – bottom edge ruby top edge olive. head – average (maximum 1.2 cm aggressive center pour) buff high density with a few surface rocks quickly diminishing to a 0.1 – 0.15 cm crown and a thin island. lacing – none. not much expected at 11% abv. aroma – 4.25 – chocolate weak char and some hints of bourbon. no hops no yeast. flavor – 4.5 – chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. bourbon not detected. slight oakiness. no hops or yeast. no ethanol (11 % abv as marked on label) aroma or taste. moderate gastric warming occurs. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. palate – 4 – medium dry side of creamy soft but lively carbonation. final impression and summation: 4 (after deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) look unremarkable pretty much like every other high abv ris or impy stout. aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have. bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste. the taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes. as the temperature reaches the end some bourbon notes finally appear. overall a good ris that’s certainly more subtle than most.
4940,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.18,i had a 2016 and was curious what 6 years of aging would do. definitely mellowed it out a bit and knocked off the rougher edges. mostly left with a mellow oak and vanilla bourbon flavor over a nice toasty base stout. quite nice.
4941,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,look - fantastic black and thick with a really nice thick foamy tan head smell - dark chocolate caramel molasses roasted malts boozy and bourbon woody smells taste - chocolate coffee with that woody caramel molasses bourbon barrel from the get go. slight dark fruit and vanilla in the back with a little bit of bitterness feel - medium full body with a very light carb. could use a little more thickness to it in my opinion but still nice overall - really nice classic ba russian imperial. very complex with a ton of smells and flavors.
4942,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.58,pours jet black like used motor oil. has a medium dark caramel head on top. gives off a burnt coffee smell. taste of roasted burning malts. barrel is nowhere to be found. overall beer is delicious!!
4943,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.36,12 oz can poured into a snifter at 55 degrees f. side by side tasting with plead the 5th: l - dark and silky with a dark hazelnut head that quickly evaporated s - bourbon molasses t - lots of bourbon drowns out most of the other flavor bit of molasses on the finish f - thick mouthfeel with medium carbonation o - good settles down nicely a bit after being decanted the bourbon fades a bit and coffee and molasses flavors become more prominent
4944,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.3,2021-12-17 12oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. no date that i can see. received in a lif associated with nbs bif #14 from @whyteboar.  pours black opaque thick-looking but not syrupy with a fairly small but fairly persistent head. smell is extremely rich bourbon vanilla molasses dates tons of anise.  taste is super chocolatey lots of vanilla anise is more on the back end hoppy/roasty bitterness coming a bit after that. building up giving me burnt toffee character.  mouthfeel is medium to thick bit of a chalky texture. this is a very good beer.
4945,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,4.05,look - absolutely love the look. organish copper with one great head and rimming/lacing that keeps on keeping on smell - grainy slight citrus tart taste - about the same feel - medium body light carb overall - pretty great
4946,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,4.44,2013
4947,Zoe,4.12,(500 ml bottle 26oct21; purchased single off shelf with reservations... poured into my belhaven pub pint)  l: polished-clear tawny-amber liquid; not much foam until i poured in the dregs which posted up a tan bouncy pad... ends up retaining a medium-thick gradient collar and it does lace a bit  s: caramelized bread crust and forest floor... maybe a slight undertone of peppermint? ghostly hint of diesel... mild note of alcohol... aromas not popping and why would they? but great depth is apparent and im still eager to dive in  t: a good bit more toast wood and stinging hop bite than expected... mild almost generic pancake syrup in the aftertaste... more malty than caramel-malty or at least theyve achieved a curiously well-measure contrast and expression between the base malt caramel additions and hop bitterness; all apparent and sitting in their own zones  f: relatively light airy buoyant... aft drags soft rug burn friction across the tongue... liquid velvet residuals  o: kind of tastes like a cask amber in this state... why the hell have i never been able to find a fresh bottle of this let alone find it at all most times??... not sure ive ever had a maine bc beer more than once but ill still keep an eye open for newborn magic (1976)
4948,Zoe,4.32,poured a translucent almost unfiltered looking reddish brown amber and topped with a 3 finger beige to tan dense head. the aroma was faint (my damaged nose not the beer’s fault) but i did get whiffs of piney hops (unexpected for me in a red ale but maybe i just need to try more of them) and biscuit like malts. the taste definitely tended towards the malts but had a surprisingly hoppy edge on it. the hops act to accentuate not clash or overwhelm the malt aspect. the feel was excellent well within the expected viscosity. glad to finally get to try this one darn good and wish it was available in west michigan.
4949,Zoe,4.5,had this from a bottle. a: pours dark amber body with thick off-white head with nice retention and lacing. s: sweet grapefruit smelling beer with some floral notes t: solid earthy grapefruit taste with a sweet malt taste to balance; aftertaste is very similar with some of the sweet alcohol notes coming through m: solid smooth body; full bodied d: nice feel and taste combo; solid dining beer overall
4950,Zoe,4.18,16.9oz bottle. bottling date stamped on label is 22feb22. clear deep amber colored body. two fingers of off white head. leaves some spots and strings of lacing. aroma has malt tones of toast and chocolate. citrus and piney hops. taste is malty with dark fruit toasted bread and a touch of chocolate at the end. hops are citrus and pine. has a base bitterness but not too much to scrunch up the face. the grains of the malt really stand out. tail off of the main flavors in the aftertaste. smooth medium weight mouth feel. the pine gives the impression of dryness. excellent carbonation. very well balanced and full of flavors. a showcase for malts.
4951,Zoe,4.13,it is truly a shame when the #1 ranked amber ale is ranked 3000+ overall in the database. dark reddish amber with a large dense head. aroma is a combination of pine and floral elements. some toasted grain as well. bittersweet flavor with plenty of pine and citrus rind with malt adding some caramel and toast. solid body and carbonation. lively but stopping short of harshness. i like nugget nectar when that beer is on point but i can see why this is rated so highly.
4952,Zoe,4.35,dark cloudy amber backlit leaves shows a nice red. light brown head very good retention and some great lacing.  nose is a beautiful combination of pine toastiness and semi sweet citrus rind.  taste follows along the same lines with a great combination of sappy orange like citrus and pine. nice malt presence adds a nice touch a light toast.  medium body resiny drying hop presence; medium to high bitterness.  probably one of the only hoppy ambers accessible in these parts. i’m glad to see it show up from time to time. if like piney sappy flavors gives this one a try you’ll like it a lot.
4953,Zoe,4.35,pours a beautiful amber with a substantial tan head that laces the glass beautifully. the nose has some stone fruit and a nice resiny pine note and some toffee notes as well.  the citrus and pine are forward on the taste and are absolutely delicious - and then the stone fruit and subtle toffee notes elevate this even more. the mouthfeel is medium and a bit drying. what an outstanding hoppy amber ale this is.
4954,Zoe,4.23,l: deep amber with a dense tan head s: piney hops and enough malt to indicate balance t: balanced with pine and citrus hops melding nicely with toasted malts and notes of toffee. i’m not getting any raisin notes? f: medium body with light carbonation (i let it sit for 30 minutes before drinking). smooth mouthfeel with a dry finish. o: definitely my favorite from mbc (yes better than lunch).
4955,Zoe,3.75,looks amber in color. smells of pine and malt. taste of pine and malt. overall its not bad.
4956,Zoe,4.52,500 ml bottle born on 3/9/21 poured into a snifter at 45 degrees f: l - amber colored with a tan head that lingered s - malts raisin t - wonderful malt sweetness with a bit of raisin on the finish f - medium mouthfeel and carbonation o - very good beer this isnt one of my favorite styles but this is a great beer
4957,Zoe,4.02,poured from the classic maine beer company bottle into a dogfish head tulip  l: dark and somewhat opaque copper/amber color with big off-white fluffy head. excellent lacing.  s: toasted grains fruit caramel citrus and earth.  t.f: just like it smells. bready grains... raisin and fruit tea citrus rind and pine. modest bitterness. earth and spice. medium bodied and well carbonated. more fruit and hops to finish.  o: an outstanding hoppy amber. looks great easy drinking and although not a favorite style of mine i definitely enjoyed it.
4958,Oktoberfest Märzen,4.39,first day of oktoberfest!  11.2 oz bottle acclimated to 41°f and poured into a dimpled stein.  pours a clear vibrant and darker rust color very nice color. produces a 1.5 finger frothy barely cream colored head lasting a while and leaving a ring and spots of lacing. beautiful beer.  initial aroma is caramel and butter solids that have been separated from the oil its also slightly reminiscent of dough. i seem to get some hops in the floral peppery range as well. after agitating i notice a mild feta like smell really does smell salty.  initial taste before swallowing is mildly bitter and sweet having trouble noticing anything else. after swallowing its yeasty with ample caramel malt and pleasant bitterness. i notice some hops in the back of the mouth tasting floral like white and green. i also get that butter solids smell in the taste which i highly enjoy and a note of bready dryness. in there i get a big hit of caramel tasting honestly like real caramel not just caramel malts theres sweetness to it too. i get butter notes too so its approaching butterscotch genuinely excellent. heavy note of damp grass with a little hay(?) in the aftertaste as well as almost a cheesiness definitely umami whatever it is.  mouthfeel is not incredible but still very nice. i would say its very easy to drink and it feels great while drinking it. not the smoothest ive had but absolutely full feeling. the carbonation can be reconstituted through agitation although i dont find it adds a huge amount.  overall im very impressed. its been a while since ive tried a märzen and i need to try more now. this excels in every category. id say my favorite overall part of the experience was the butter solids in the taste and smell and the big hit of caramel which tasted like real caramel and really wowed me. this could be a rare example of beer id drink while eating although id stick to uncomplicated foods. i could easily drink several happily especially in the late september weather as intended. i love it!  i will definitely buy again 6 packs. ill happily recommend it as well.
4959,Oktoberfest Märzen,4,12oz undated bottle.  pours clear copper with an in of white head. moderate retention and lacing. toasted bread crusts in the nose with proofing dough. medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. a bit tacky. sweet plump malt on the palate with a balancing bitterness. finishes malty and fairly sturdy without excessive sweetness.
4960,Oktoberfest Märzen,4,good marzen happy to find on tap. up front i was getting tons of malts and bitter hops. about half way through i was picking up a lot of banana esters and alcohol sweetness a bit of caramel on the finish. kind of played with my mind. i’ll have to revisit this again to sort out my thoughts.
4961,Oktoberfest Märzen,4.6,this is the oktoberfest you want if you like malty beers. my guess is that this is the maltiest oktoberfest you will find anywhere at any price today and its certainly the maltiest i have had in many many years. it pours a vibrant copper color and sports a good head that lasts.  side rant: this is precisely the oktoberfest i wish more small breweries would brew. it is unapologetically roasty and malty and i don\t know if it is too expensive and/or too hard to brew for less experienced brewers but if you own or work at a small brewery taste/analyze this year\s hacker-pschorr\s oktoberfest and then try to make it. there\s a difference you can taste in this beer. this tastes like old-school oktoberfest (let the price of malt in 2023 be damned!). i honestly don\t think there\s any margin on this brew so i\m just going to conclude that this is hacker-pschorr\s gift to us this fall. so just enjoy it. prost!
4962,Oktoberfest Märzen,4.89,appearance: brilliantly clear medium amber. frothy off white head with excellent retention.  aroma: bready and toasty malt. spicy/herbal hops.  flavor: toasted and bready malt. spicy/herbal hops. restrained bitterness.  mouth feel: soft medium bodied. moderate carbonation. clean dry finish.  overall: perfect visual. has the best head retention of all german marzens. distinct complex malt profile with toasty and spicy flavor. aroma also slight unique menthol note that is not unpleasant but displays mostly herbal and spicy aroma and flavor. always an excellent choice if you are not sure what to choose. compared to ayinger (one of the best) it drinks a little heavier/sweeter but still quite dry.
4963,Oktoberfest Märzen,3.97,pours crystal clear. light copper colored with decent head. limited lacing.  solid aromas of caramel malt and earthy hopping. a touch of grass.  the brew has hallmark malt sweetness up front but there is plenty of earthy and grassy hopping to balance it.  great carbonation without getting fizzy. smooth and almost drying.  pretty darn good.
4964,Oktoberfest Märzen,3.54,bottle into fancy mug a: substantial head no lacing penny colored s: the smells are good but honestly its kind of weak like not putting out enough molecules. hard to get much nuance other than mildly roasty malt t: roasted malt right up front with a biscuity taste (like when you slightly over cook biscuits in a good way). a pleasant floral sweetness follows. unsurprisingly given the thin aroma the taste passes quickly. long but weak finish. m: thin o: i recently had a bell\s octoberfest which bills itself as a session type beer. this is a toastier version of same.
4965,Oktoberfest Märzen,4.24,a good oktoberfest smooth pours a dark copper with fast dissipating head smells like dark fruit and bready malt and the taste is fruity bready malty but a little bitter and dry but not overly sweet or cloying. this is a keeper for sure maybe my favorite marzen to date cheers!
4966,Oktoberfest Märzen,4.26,poured from bottle the body is the familiar amber /light brown. fuzzy white head dissipates quickly and retreats to a thin edge ring. light lacing.  nose is an inviting malt. taste follows nose and adds a balancing small bitter note. a light malty sweetness is present but very much background.  mouthfeel is smooth and satisfying with solid carbonation and slight coating of the palate ( though it is not a coating of sweetness).  superdrinkable as an oktoberfest märzen ought to be. best example of the style for my tastes.
4967,Affogato,4.32,look - black thick great big tan head that stays forever with great lacing smell - coffee vanilla creamy slight chocolate taste - coffee vanilla chocolate slight milky feel - medium body and creamy overall - wish it had more body but otherwise pretty good
4968,Affogato,4.5,brew: trillium brewing company – affogato  intro: 750 mil. poured into a tulip glass. shared with a friend  appearance: dark virtually black color. ample head maybe 2 inches. moderate lacing as we drank  smell: coffee in the foreground followed by chocolate and vanilla.  taste: followed along with the smell. coffee is not overpowering. the chocolate lead up the flavor profile.  mouthfeel: medium mouthfeel medium carbonation.  drink: very well rounded. very enjoyable.  conclusion: easy to see why this is one of the top american imperial stouts. was a very enjoyable experience. would not hesitate to pick up more if it presented itself.
4969,Pseudo Sue,4.69,this pale ale reminds me very much of zombie dust. i had it on draft and it was obviously fresh so i shouldnt compare them but damn this was seriously a world class pale ale. plenty of balance with the hops and malt and plenty of fruit flavors up front. ill be headed back to that restaurant again just for another one of these on draft. ive never seen it before in my area but i highly recommend it.
4970,Pseudo Sue,4.5,yup ... worthy of its five star status ... every characteristic that can be rated is excellent.... every beer ive had from these people has been top notch
4971,Pseudo Sue,3.83,a: a very dusty orange in cookie with a light white head.  s: hoppy and grassy with grapefruit tones.  t: citrus with orange peel and grapefruit standing out. lovely.  m: medium body moderate carbonation b and a creamy feel to it.  o: overall very enjoyable.
4972,Pseudo Sue,4.47,poured from the 16oz can into a pint glass. the beer is a bright hazy orange color murky and opaque topped with a 2 finger fizzy off-white head. i am thinking i will need to fight comparisons to king sue but for the appearance it isn\t as milky as i would have described the other beer. it is a little duller. it looks like a very hazy ipa.  smell is very strong and refreshing and apparent from some distance away even when just opening the can. quite tropical. orange and citrus rind. grapefruit juice. pineapple mango. balance upon further inspection in some bready malt within. some piney hop in the mix but not as much as advertised or described by other reviewers in my opinion.  taste has a bit more of the pine notes but it also more balanced with a more malty character than anticipated. biscuit. honey. it is lacking some of the heat i perceived in king sue but that is a good thing. smooth. fruit again is tropical with a lot more orange and mango. tropical notes throughout but balanced with a dryness. finishes with a touch of pine.  drinkable. accessible. this is possibly a gateway beer that i would introduce others to craft with. but that being said it is far from bland. in many ways this is what i want most hazy ipas to be. balanced refreshing tropical flavorful. even (almost) sessionable. i wouldn\t call it exciting (some of the best beers are not) but i would call it world-class for the style. does exactly what you want.
4973,Pseudo Sue,4.02,purchased online from halftime beverage; my second brew from toppling goliath vessel: council belgian-style tulip  p- opaque orange with a 1f foamy white head; decent retention n- med to med-bold; stone fruit and citrusy notes with light-med sweetness t- follows nose; stone fruit citrus and green hops over biscuity malt; grapefruit in the aftertaste; some citrusy tang in there as well (bef the finish); subdued sweetness; pleasant but not super interesting/notable mf- med-full bodied; med-high carb o- much like king sue (which i tried recently) i was expecting to be wowed by this but it fell short of my expectations; not a bad hazy pale ale though- just not quite getting the world class elements of it  review date: 01-11-23 can date: 10-14-22
4974,Pseudo Sue,4.5,not as hoppy as most ipas. thats my only negative but might be a positive for some. nice smooth taste otherwise.
4975,Pseudo Sue,3.8,we tasted this beer and we all were pretty much in agreement. nice color fast dissolving head and a somewhat pleasant nose. citrus or grapefruit came through on the nose but it wasnt overpowering. it was clean and crisp on the mouthfeel but average on the flavor. tasted like a plain old beer. not much bite. although it wasnt too dry or bitter on the backside which is a plus. i wouldn\t call it a good beer just average. www.obbts.org
4976,Black Chocolate Stout,4.04,black in color with a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top. the aroma is of dark chocolate. i’m tasting bitter dark chocolate dark malt and some piney hops. the mouth is thick and sticky.
4977,Black Chocolate Stout,4.75,excellent stout!
4978,Black Chocolate Stout,3.85,allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 18 minutes and poured into a snifter.  pours an incredibly dark brown with equally dark brown hints around the edges and a 1.5 finger dark tan head.  initial aroma is a hint of black licorice followed by dutch processed cocoa powder i think theres some raisin in there. i might get a tiny hint of smoke and oak but i might be hallucinating.  initial taste is bold and powerful perhaps a small hint of licorice but otherwise just a big and slightly overwhelming experience to take a large sip. its quickly followed by bitter dutch cocoa taste across the middle back and sides of the tongue in the middle and aftertaste. i get some bitterness not from the chocolate but from the beer itself as well. tasting it again after i realize that in the initial taste its the alcohol im tasting followed by the licorice then the cocoa and bitterness. as i get through it i taste a little raspberry but only in the aftertaste and only when sipping very small amounts its a much welcomed note with the chocolate. additionally as i get towards the end the alcohol becomes more noticable in both aroma and taste. at the end i thought the alcohol tasted similar to that of vodka burn and made me think of hass avocado skin and the color olive drab. i know that doesnt make sense sorry.  the mouthfeel is nice not exactly velvet smooth but it is definitely smooth. it glides over the tongue easily. oily and slick in a good way if that makes sense.  this is something i could imagine myself sipping slowly with my legs crossed wearing a nice jacket and having a discussion with someone in a nice living room.  may buy again but not terribly likely overall a good beer that i enjoyed but did not adore and i think im satisfied with drinking once.
4979,Black Chocolate Stout,3.97,this is a yearly purchase for me and it’s been interesting to note the slight variation with each release. as always this is a great looking stout. black with some brown edging tan head with decent retention. getting some char molasses and fig in the aroma along with a dark chocolate backbone. the taste surprised me however. i can still remember the utter shock i had many many years ago when i found out that this beer does not actually contain chocolate. it was an eye-opening experience to see what could be accomplished through malt selection and high-level brewing technique. this year’s release however has a super roasty almost burnt quality. the chocolate also seems much more like a super dark bitter (85% cacao) version rather than the smoother fudgier flavor i’m used to. it’s alright on the way down but the finish & aftertaste are harsh. a bit of a letdown compared to prior years but still decent.
4980,Black Chocolate Stout,2.46,i didn’t taste much chocolate. quite bitter. disappointing.
4981,Black Chocolate Stout,4.15,ive been enjoying bbcs for over 20 years presented and promoted it for over a decade offered it in numerous beer tasting events on tap fresh and in vintage bottles. but this is my 1st review here. its changed over the years as will this one if stored properly. new brown swirly label i dont care for - the classy image of the white on black is missing. the pour results in a tall dark tan head of sticky foam with good persistence and specks of lace over a jet black liquid. the aroma is big and sweet but not bold or overwhelming. strong treacle and molasses notes mix with bakers chocolate dripped over warm oatmeal with a splash of tequila. the flavor is busy - sharp black grain and long boil hop bitterness stab the tongue up front right along with the caramel malt sweetness that adds depth and complexity. softer hints of drunken cherries and berries figs and rye bread all blend with the charred grain and sweet toffee stoutness. body is big and alcohol doesnt hide well even in the deep warm stout flavors. the finish is long and bitter grassy hops wet leather and black coffee. still a winner but in a boring new package/label.
4982,Black Chocolate Stout,4.3,walking through my local wegmans looking for a new imperial stout to try. i remember reading the reviews about this one so i thought i’d pick it up. i’m glad i did. pours dark with a tan head. very delicious and even better the closer it gets to room temperature. definitely putting a few of these away to see what aging does to it.
4983,Black Chocolate Stout,4.91,valhalla in a bottle.
4984,Black Chocolate Stout,4.29,12 oz bottle bottled on: winter 2019 consumed on: 26 dec 2022 glass: tulip snifter abv: 10% serving temp: room temp   look: black with a 23-finger high creamy dark tan to light brown head. the head dissipates slowly leaving very good lacing.  smell: dark roasted malts with a touch of char. rich semisweet dark chocolate mixed with some milk chocolate notes. a touch of vanilla.  taste: all the aromas are here and dialed up a notch. a black licorice or anise note joins the party about mid-sip. this is followed by light smokey notes and a light touch of char and ash. some molasses even sneaks in and perhaps a hint of a dark fruit. a mild bitterness then arrives and helps to change the chocolate to a bittersweet variety. the sip finishes lightly bitter a tad dry malty and lighltly chocolatey.  feel: creamy silky and viscous. warmth from the alcohol can be felt. the body is medium.  overall: a very nice russian imperial stout. great aromas. great flavors. enjoyable and easy to drink. i dont detect much bitterness which must be from the 3 years that i had this beer in the cellar.
4985,Black Chocolate Stout,4.24,one of those beers that ive drank so many times over the years that im surprised i havent reviewed it. 2022 vintage. pours black with a brown head good retention and lacing smoke roast chocolate and dark fruit aroma. burnt caramel dark chocolate and dried fruit. heavy bodied but dry. lower carbonation. the one of the few imperial stouts you can rely on being there every year and not changing. fwiw i once had a 14yo one that had been stored in a fridge and it tasted like ruby port and cocoa.
4986,Julius,4.44,poured from a can into a teku glass appearance – the beer pours a very hazy orange color with a big puffy head of off-white foam. the head has a great level of retention fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass. smell -the aroma is big of a musty grainy and bready smell mixed with lots of raw hop aromas of a herbal and earthy nature. there are other citrus aromas of orange and tangerine as well as hints of grapefruit mixed within. notes of apricot and some grass are in there as well giving a rather raw and sorta green smell to the brew overall. taste – the taste starts out drier than one would anticipate from the nose. it begins with a mix of bready and cracker malt flavors combined with hop flavors of a very potent herbal and grapefruit hop. notes of a floral and pine hop flavor are there as well but these tastes are light in comparison to the herbal hop. all the hop flavors are rather “raw” in nature having an almost hop pellet like flavor associated with them. these potent flavors are the dominant ones throughout much of the taste. while said there is a decent showing of fruit flavors of tangerine peach and apricot as well as a hint of mango. the mix of sweet bready and hop take the taste to its end where it leaves one with a rather green hopped and slightly fruity and malty taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body is a bit more on the creamy and chewy side with a carbonation level that is on the more moderate side. for the rich hop and malt flavors the feel is well done and makes for a nice easy sipper. overall – a very nice brew overall. i think i like this better than the king julius as it is more approachable from my standpoint but hits all the same high notes as the king variety. big and flavor and drinkability with a nice blend of hop malt and fruit.
4987,Julius,4.89,its in the top 250 for a reason. top tier.
4988,Julius,5,favorite beer between this and king julius and all the other julius versions.
4989,Julius,4.35,a smidge more than a fingers worth of rich fluffy light khaki colored froth... rock solid retention... color is a moderately hazed medium to dark tangerine.. lovely nose of pineapple mango and assorted citrus... some light wheat notes linger beneath the surface... hop presence is more floral and less citrus and reminds me of whole cone fresh hops... some lemon zest notes as well... feel is light to medium bodied and a touch thin... carbonation is minimal... highly quaffable... enjoyable and highly recommended but much more muted than i would have expected given the lofty reputation...
4990,Julius,4.57,smell is all ripe mango with a faint hint of peach. pour is a dark orange and totally opaque with a small head that dissappates fairly quickly. the taste is bitter upfront with sharp carbonation followed hard by mango and then a peachy aftertaste. a really good beer for sure bit it may benefit from sitting for a week on the shelf to mellow the upfront astringency some; this one was purchased from the brewery yesterday.
4991,Julius,4.55,the beer that made treehouse. bright orange haze nice balance between sweet and bitter reminiscent of orange zest. mouthfeel thats pleasantly tongue-coating but not cloyingly creamy.
4992,Julius,4.8,look - orange juice hazy fluffy white head scattered lacing left smell - peach melon citrus taste - peach melon citrus pith hoppy feel - medium body well carbonated citrus pith hoppy finish overall - a wonderfully crafted brew coming in at 6.8% that is the epitome of a hazy juicy ne ipa. right from the start with a juicy hazy look and strong scent of tropical fruit it just feels like its gonna be great. then you hit the first sip and yes it is. julius lives up to the hype. i loved the citrus pith hoppy finish. get a hold of julius if you can and pair up with sweet emotion by aerosmith. enjoy!
4993,Julius,4.78,4 pack picked up at the sandwich location. deep orange appearance with a solid couple inches of head. taste is very fruity and still balanced with some malty background. good balance between sweet and bitter. orange and orange peel. some nectarine. mouthfeel is medium not heavy.
4994,Julius,3.71,ths neipas ar top tier and found this flagship to be their beast. juicy with that classic hazy flavor maybe more citrus hint than expected but still very good. go to the brewery in sturbridge if u get a chance quite a venue. btw - go early.
4995,Julius,4.51,pours a very hazed honey color with a finger of cream colored head. nice lacing & pretty good head retention  s: plenty of orange some peaches strawberries  t: plenty of orange some green melon peaches dryness & lime up front a little lemongrass & a touch of juicy acidity. tangerine lime dryness & kiwi fruit s this beer warms up just a little bit of grassyness & peach too. finishes with pomelo green melon lime & dryness plus a kiss of vanilla & pineapple  mf: medium body creamy carbonation great balance  very citrussy & juicy maybe not quite as i imagined it to be but still a big hell yeah on this has all the juice
4996,Julius,4.43,canned 4.3.23  poured at about 40° into a weizen glass  first impression of all the categories put together was a flat out wow  pours pure gorgeous juice with a nice off white pillowy head. 4.25  mango and peach forward aroma with some nice hoppy herbals. 4.25  bright tropical juicy sweetness and low bitterness full hop backbone. this seriously blew me away and i enjoy ipas but i love this .4.5  very soft body with low carbo almost a touch of juicy puckering but the aftertaste was sublime. 4.5  overall to date the best ipa ive ever had and i dont think my words have done it justice so a solid 4.5 will have to do!
4997,Flipside Red IPA,3.86,poured a 12oz bottle into an ipa glass. clear dark amber color with a lot of tiny carbonation bubbles popping up. off white head is thick and lasts forever. a lot of lacing left behind in the glass. smell is sweet brown bread citrus fruits and pine. taste follows with a bit of sweet malt up front some caramel then pine and citrus kick in bitterness is minimal finish leaves behind a hit of pine. feel is medium bodied soft carbonation. overall a solid hoppy red ale. easy drinker tasty solid.
4998,Flipside Red IPA,4.15,look - deep amber/red solid off white head good lacing rings smell - bready piney tangerine taste - bready piney pine resin tangerine peppery spice chocolate feel - medium body moderate carbonation pine resin bitter finish overall - 3 flipsides in the fan favorites pack. the first one was good and by the third it was hitting on all cylinders. bready malt and tangerine up front. really good pine resin and spicy finish that lingers with hints of pepper and chocolate. solid brew that pairs well with wheels of fire by manowar.
4999,Flipside Red IPA,3.83,poured from a 12 oz bottle into a willi becher pint glass. l - pours a reddish brown color with a white head. s - smells malty & earthy. t - tastes of hops and malts. f - medium body and carbonation. o - kind of a hoppy red ale. pretty nice.
5000,Flipside Red IPA,4.31,so excited to try this again. havent had it since 2014 or 2015 when it was still a seasonal.  clear dark red in color basically chestnut. capped with a nice creamy off white head. excellent retention and lacing.  smells like rye peppery spicy; sweet burnt sugar; pine cones/sap...?  taste smacks hard of pumpernickel bread burnt sugar molasses red velvet cake...but rather than go cloying the sweetness gets cut with pine sap pine needles black pepper fennel red grapefruit peel. nice bitterness and spice cuts through that sweetness. rich and malty nice body chuggable. creamy carbonation. nice piney bitterness but doesnt overwhelm. scrubs the palate clean save for a lingering slickness.  damn this a damn fine beer. i remember why this impressed me so much. malt for days but no cloy clean bitterness and impact. endless drinkability. sierra nevada please bring this back!
5001,Flipside Red IPA,4.38,light chestnut brown with hints of red when backlit head is light light brown great retention and well above average lacing; mostly clear.  something dark fruit like pungent caramelize citrus character toasty and bark like light sweet sappiness.  taste is a really neat mix of all sorts of hop and malt; the hops are gently fruity like but quickly become biting with bitter citrus rind and light pine the malt lends a nice touch of toast and some caramelization.  clean and easy drinking; noticeable lingering bitterness smoothly carbed with a dry finish that really pairs nice with the bitter; hops give so nice stickiness to this beer.  this is a really awesome well balanced yet nicely malty ipa; thanks again for doing this sierra nevada.
5002,Flipside Red IPA,3.63,clear mahogany nice off white head great retention rings of lace grapefruit generic tropical pine and floral hop aromas rich malt underneath toasted brown bread caramel some grapefruit and tropical fruit malt flavors medium bodied and appropriately carbonated didnt check the date when i bought the mixed pack so three months old and the hops have definitely dropped off but was probably dope when fresh.
5003,Flipside Red IPA,4.18,7/17/23 grabbed a single last week $2.25 never heard of this and wasnt aware (at the time) was part of an mixed fan favorites pack ... liked it alot logged on to review only to find my long forgotten review from 2013 ... this is not that review. looks good smells good. tastes good premium red ale in a bottle yes i drink canned beer now all the rage and you know what theyre all whats wrong with craft these days ... yes huge drinks yes overly sugarized every 19.2 oz can ...the pathetic state of craft these days. but this was good enough to go get another single today and yes would buy more if available. not the mixed 12 pak. the ruthless rye i also tried was ok i am an old hop rod rye lover. bear republic bring it back. x5k out.  original 2013 well. lately ive made a point to only review beers i like. this is not that review. if they let me i could do this review in one word ... mediocre. or boring weak uninspired average. you choose. or my choice why? color is uninspiring red. smells and tastes slightly bitter hops not very drinkable and rather poor mouthfeel. the good is that i only paid $1.49 and i only got one. waste of time.
5004,Flipside Red IPA,3.75,look is more brown than red and quite murky. not impressive looking by any stretch.  smell is very void of much anything. bottle is exactly 3 months old. dossappinting here too.  taste is pretty lackluster. almost like an arrogsnt bastard ale with only 1/4 of the bitterness.  feel is sorta oily  overall i would not but this beer again. it came in a mix 12 pack so i have 2 more of them but would much rather them have been one of the other varieties or simply just a snpa instead.
5005,Flipside Red IPA,4.55,this is like a better version of arrogant bastard ale to me. its a thicker more syrupy red ale. it is very well balanced of high dose of malt with hops to balance it out. flavor is spot on. the alcohol however is not well hidden. i thought this might be 8% alcohol and was surprised to see it is only 6.2%. it has a strong after taste of alcohol going down. i dont mind it though. i wonder though if the label is correct? caramel flavor is there darker caramel.
5006,Dirty Bastard,4,strong dark fruit flavors with roasted bitterness.
5007,Dirty Bastard,3.73,interesting flavor but i might be a wee lad. wonder how thisd pair with a glass of scotch whisky; i think itd go well probably.
5008,Dirty Bastard,2.93,real thick hazy caramel color with some stained fizz head all plump like a biscuit. it doesnt smell like much to me right now but my nose is a tad stuffy. tastes like... the left side of a boot sole? you can really see what they mean by dirty bastard its heavy and strong and it hits you hard with those delayed hops but i dunno... founders historically hasnt done a lot for me and i cant say that the dirty bastard changed my mind. reminds me of a post christmas december evening right when its really starting to snow and you get home from work after dark and youre a little glum from the holiday season being over and then you notice that the wet snow has soaked into your parka. i would say that wet snow in clothes is the best descriptor for this one (not entirely bad)
5009,Dirty Bastard,4.5,i’m reviewing this for the style of dark thick string beer which this is. it’s resinous and sticky and thick and taste like caramel raisins. if i wanted to sip a darker thick boy of a beer slowly this is great.  i usually like to throw back beers though so i probably won’t be drinking this one too often. but it’s a great beer i’d have at a restaurant if i only wanted to order one. this would pair well with a juicy steak.
5010,Dirty Bastard,3.79,early rating was a bit rough. a much better beer non-refrigerated. i do get some of the peat-y taste more of the alcohol at the bottom. refriged it had like zero smell or body. im enjoying it much better getting more of the taste at room temp.
5011,Dirty Bastard,4.04,on tap at the brewery.  appearance: medium dark brown very small light tan head that lingered leaving some lacing.  nose: a little peat a bit of cooked sugar sweetness.  mouthfeel: smooth medium heavy adequate carbonation.  attack: toasted malt light sweetness.  finish: balancing bitterness.  overall: a very good scotch ale. doesn’t have quite the bang of the barrel-aged backwoods but solid.
5012,Dirty Bastard,4.1,a- awesome. rich mahogany brownish head espresso  s-toasted malt reminiscent of a brown ale dark fruit dates iron  t- toffee rich malt character candied fruit leather  m good  o- rich nuanced light a quad and a barley wine had a bastard baby. very good
5013,Dirty Bastard,4.5,i have had a few other scotch ales and they tended to be heavier and sweeter. this one pour amber-dark and has a nice head. it smells of malt and a bit of alcohol. the flavor is spot on one of the best scotch ales i have ever tried. if you are looking for one of the best scotch ales this is it.
5014,Dirty Bastard,4.65,one of my favorites for cool or cold days. the taste is caramel. warms me up inside. would love to have it on tap but for now in north texas the bottle is all i have. i can find it in most stores.
5015,Dirty Bastard,3.68,look: dark red 1 finger head  smell: toffee with a hint of malt  taste: tasty. sweet not what i was expecting at all but it’s super good  feel: lingers in your mouth for a minute  overall: very good! very surprising beer
5016,Dirty Bastard,3.89,year-round release - 6 pack 12 oz. bottle dated 01.12.23 - 8.5% abv / 50 ibu brewed and bottled in grand rapids mi poured into a bells branded nonic pint glass  look - pours a thick and fluffy tan colored head that leaves lacing. slightly clear dark reddish amber appearance. smell - the scent is sweet toffee roasted malt caramel dark cherry. no scent of alcohol. taste - the taste follows the nose with sweet toffee being the most dominate. not really getting any hop taste other than a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. the alcohol is undetectable. feel - medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel and finishes very dry. overall - the sweet toffee flavor kinda borders on overpowering making this pretty unbalanced and almost cloyingly sweet.
5017,Big Eye,2.95,355 ml bottle from fakta hirtshals. bb date is hard to read but probably 25.03.2014. slightly hazy deep golden to amber colour moderate to low head slightly off-white. strong and unpleasant aroma of stale orange marmalade and rotting fruits and vegetables. distinctly hoppy and resinous flavour better than the aroma not too sweet with a solid bitterness in the finish.
5018,Big Eye,4.06,from 5/21/16
5019,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.69,it’s an american macro adjunct lager. looks like them all taste like rice. it’s only advantage over the others is it’s more cool. i like the nostalgia that comes from drinking this but not much else.
5020,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.71,my go to everyday beer $19 for 30 cans great taste all around good beer.
5021,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),5,i actually like it alot. i am no conisiour but it is very good
5022,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.65,12 oz can poured straight from the fridge into a pilsner glass  pours a clear yellow gold with a quickly dissipating 1 finger sudsy white head leaving behind minimal lacing and a film of head.  initial aroma is cereal grainy bready malt crisp and yeasty. its the classic lager smell a little in the way of fruity yeasty esters. after agitating im hit with a blast of yeast not quite funk but something in the vein of yogurt bacteria theres also a high amount of malt.  initial taste before swallowing is malty sweet almost fruity. after swallowing im met with a large dose of grain and malt flavors a little tasteless but the taste that is there is good. relatively high sweetness throughout the whole process.  mouthfeel is honestly better than i would expect from a 4.8%. its not spectacular but its not really thin either. carbonation is overall mediocre but definitely adds a lot it fades quickly but rejuvenates impressively upon agitating.  overall i totally understand why this is revered as a good cheap beer. like listen. its not a great beer but its already not bad and for $1 a can it becomes better. i realize thats not the healthiest way to measure the worth of something especially alcohol but im not buying in large amounts. it excels for the adjunct lager style while being inoffensive and extremely easy to drink if nothing else.  definitely will purchase again at some point in the future likely in 6 pack format and will recommend as a good cheap beer. will not purchase often but still.
5023,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.16,16oz can. date stamp on can bottom is oct2323 for best by consumption. clear pale gold colored body. thin white small bubble head. this head is constantly replenished by rising bubbles. left behind are some scattered spots of lacing. aroma of grain and corn malts very doughy. has a little floral and earthy hops. taste is malt laden - grain and corn which is slightly sweet. floral and fruity hops. quick end to the aftertaste. touch of sulfur. slightly thin for mouth feel but this might have something to do with the rapid exit of flavors after each sip or quaff. smooth and crisp finish. very good carbonation. wet and simple profile. poundable. does not get in the way of bar activities.
5024,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.84,light clear golden color. great for hot weather when youre eating and dont want anything to distract from the flavor or when youre doing something that youre not thinking about the beer itself like watching sports. definitely not a craft beer nothing exciting or interesting about it but it is not bad for what it is which is a cheap macrobrew. think of it as a palate cleanser when you get tired of all the high flavor microbrews and then youll be fine with it.
5025,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.46,this is a great beer cold or warm goes down easy and doesnt have much of a head. its great to have when ya wanna drink a lot of beer. good for taking to the river or beach.
5026,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.27,for a cheap beer it tastes quite good.
5027,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3,a beer enjoyed by both manly men and girly men (hipsters) alike. i first remember seeing hipsters drinking this beer for $1.50 a bottle at my favorite dive bar back in 2005. then by 2011 there must have been an article about it in hipster monthly magazine because fedoras began to tip by the millions nationwide for pbr. the beer tastes okay and it’s in the 11 dollar range for a 12pk which is the new cheap for beer. it is the gold standard for a 3 out of 5 beer.  style: american lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 4.8% | rating: 3
5028,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),5,og beer. gets the job done
5029,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.26,poured into an 8-ounce 1940s era stange which is probably one of the only types of glasses that can keep a head on this light-bodied beer. the head stayed and left lacing as i drank it. the beer has a pronounced aroma of grain and hops. the taste is better than expected and remembered with a slightly bitter aftertaste. for the style it is very good and i do not understand the poor rating.
5030,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.36,when you value quantity over quality this is your beer.
5031,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.24,this is the most okay beer. not unpleasant. not good. you could drink it but most craft beers are better.
5032,Beyond Good And Evil,5,smells like hot buttered rum and coffee liquor. tastes divine. bourbon barrels impart a very strong flavor. rich. dense. smooth. delicious. incredible head looks like espresso.
5033,Beyond Good And Evil,4.81,amazing stout - not too sweet.
5034,Beyond Good And Evil,5,a perfect ba maple stout. had on site at hf was a 2018 vintage. perfect.
5035,Beyond Good And Evil,4.5,2018 vintage on tap. tan head. black color (dark brown).  smooth silky light roast light heat. awesome bourbon and fudge notes. the maple adds a nice light sweetness that goes well with the heat and roast from the barrels. toasted marshmallow. chocolate. full bodied great feel. very surprised with how much i liked this as i haven’t enjoyed hill stouts in the past.
5036,Beyond Good And Evil,4.56,l -- jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour. hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a half s -- waves of rich milk chocolate wet bourbon barrel prune fig chocolate covered cherries vanilla maple and light smoke. smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout t -- incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. the bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. very rich mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. the bourbon is just a hair on the hot side f -- big mouthfeel medium- carb. lasting sweet finish. oily and slick less velvety than expected o -- one of the best barrel aged stouts ive had. patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging and hill farmstead has it in spades. very pricey @$25/17 oz but its worth it  91/100
5037,Old Milwaukee Light,2.64,from a 12oz can:  appearance: pale yellow good head.  smell: mild malt hint of sourness.  taste: mild sweetness light corn flavor very mild bitterness in the finish.  overall: grabbed an extra after softball for a review. pretty decent light beer some flavor and even a bit of bitterness. easy drinking and inexpensive i might have to grab it instead of miller lite on occasion.
5038,Old Milwaukee Light,3.97,old mil has a beer i drank when i was in college because of the price when i was in college was 9 bucks a case and as i have got older its made a resurgence in my area after being on a single case stack at the local beer store they now carry it by the pallet. this beer is extremely smooth and to many drinkers tastes like beer nothing offensive but does not blow you away. can basically copy and paste this to the old mil premium but no point to go with premium due to no noticeable taste difference and just higher calories. edit review. this beer has replaced busch light as my go to beer combination of flavor and cost. there is a reason that this product has won so many award and is the most award winning light beer regardless of hipsters and fanboys wanting to trash it because it is a (cheaper) beer. people need to realize that just because a beer costs more does not mean it is better.
5039,Old Milwaukee Light,3.78,12 ounce can into lager glass best before 9/23/2019. pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. aromas of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. a bit of fruity corn aromas but not overwhelming. nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. taste of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. light herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and no astringent flavors after the finish. fairly crisp/clean finishing. very clean on lager flavors with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. medium-plus carbonation and light body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.8%. overall this is a very nice light adjunct lager. all around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. very flavorful and not watery for the abv. nice clean pils malt/grain showcase with great earthy hop presence/balance for the style. not overdone on adjuncts. minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. a very enjoyable offering and outstanding style example. one of the best macro light lagers ive had as expected of pabst.
5040,Old Milwaukee Light,4.88,i usually drink labatt light blue. royal or milwaukees best light but old milwaukee light was 50 cents cheaper than the best light. i tried it nice clean sweet taste. it didnt have foam overkill like best light overall a much better buy than bud light miller light or coors light best bang for the buck
5041,Old Milwaukee Light,2.42,pretty sure i had this before pabst acquired them was never a go to but was cheap easy to drink and readily available. it comes in at just below halfway between poor and average.
5042,Old Milwaukee Light,2.42,from notes taken 09/24/17:  very pale and clear straw gold. lemon-white cap of fine uneven fluff with surprisingly good retention. nose is faint lemon sweet not sour pinch of yeast some grass. light grain palate adjunct but not distractingly so. no honey suggestions which is good. overall like mineral water with a few drops of lemon and melon juice. pretty standard fare refreshing enough light in body with tight spritzy carbonation.
5043,Old Milwaukee Light,2.67,an hour before my buddy\s wedding in bascom oh this week i decided more emergency beer was needed for possible late night. so i ran down the road to tiffin to pick somehing up and this was what i ended up with. i was going to do the regular old mil but they only had thirty packs and that seemed excessive.  this is incredibly bland and flavorless but also overcarbonated and watery. fine for easy pounding but not something worth looking out for.
5044,Milk Stout,3.83,i had this beer poured from draft into a shaker pint. flat dark brown color with good head and lacing. smell and taste of milk chocolate. smokey earthy and very easy to drink. nice feel for the style.  actually surprised i had not reviewed before.
5045,Milk Stout,3.86,12oz bottle pours a very deep brown-black color with a small cap of dark tan-colored head that recede to a thick ring around the edge of the glass while leaving a small amount of lacing. smells of dark roasted malts and rich chocolate. taste is very rich on roasted and charred malt notes dark chocolate milk chocolate and coffee with a hint of caramel toffee and dark fruits. the flavor is very robust and deep with a noticeable but by no means overpowering sweetness and a slightly astringent burnt bitterness to close. full-bodied with a very luxurious smooth (almost syrupy) mouthfeel and subtle carbonation.  this was a very tasty and well-balanced milk stout. definitely not overly bitter like many american stouts nor overwhelmingly sweet like many milk stouts. have had this beer before and will certainly buy again.
5046,Milk Stout,4.01,pours into my guinness glass quite dark. brown-black with a thin ring not really a head.  i can’t smell anything. (bad air these days.)  tastes sweet. almost like cola. but nicely dark-beer roasty. the alcohol isn’t very noticeable. malty. no bitterness for me.  feels thin and light. lightly carbonated.  overall pretty good. better as it warms.
5047,Milk Stout,4.11,440ml can - pours black with a 1.5 finger cream head with decent retention. onthe nose its fairly sweet with a touch of coffee. up front it tastes of roasted malted barley and coffee followed by a hint of dark chocolate (with a very subtle bitterness) and vanilla. overall its very sweet and enjoyable.
5048,Milk Stout,4.04,pouring straight into a snifter - minimal head appearing. aromas of sweet milk chocolate coffee molasses and malts. definitely tastes as advertised but isnt as sweet as one expects. getting malts/molasses upfront followed by coffee and a nice roasty coffee ending. feel is so smooth due to the nitrogen easy to sip cant taste that 6% at all in this. i tried this in the beginning stages of trying stouts but can decipher it a lot better and have to say this is still a good treat to have. try this if your beginning to try stouts and youll love it.
5049,Milk Stout,4.15,404ml can served cold into a pint glass. lcbo purchase for around $4 cdn  appearance - dark brown color close to a finger of dense fluffy tan head. great staying power.  smell - lots of dark chocolate a hint of raisins and some coffee backing everything up. good intensity.  taste - semi sweet chocolate with some coffee in the aftertaste. i get glosette raisins mid sip. pretty delicious stuff mildly bitter with nice sweet centre.  mouthfeel - medium full bodied and very creamy.  overall - an excellent milk stout one of the very best that is widely available. glad to have finally tried now that a batch has come to ontario.
5050,Milk Stout,4.09,poured from a 12oz bottle best by 02/05/2023  on the pour one finger of fine tan head formed then recedes to a decent covering and ring that leaves nice lacing but continues dissipating. body is a solid black even up to light i wish there was a bit more head though.  aroma is dark and smooth. like a better sweeter and ever so slightly fruitier guiness. dark chocolate with a hint of roast verging on coffee with some sweet malty notes make up this one. slight hops are present but they blend in nicely and are mostly bittering.  taste follows the aroma with even more roasty almost bitter malts that are quickly balanced by a molasses dark chocolate sweetness. the roast comes out even more in the finish with true and smooth roasty barley making up the aftertaste retaining some sweetness.  feel is laid back smooth and easy drinking but still has that cozy vibe that a good stout should bring. not too thick or syrupy but still quite full. quite attenuated despite the sweetness and is almost dry bit not quite with a slight mouthcoating maltiness.  overall this was exactly what i was looking for. for a slightly chilly early fall night after drinking too many lagers a nice dark ale was in order but i didnt want too many hops or to go too heavy. this is close to refreshing but has a laid back armchair vibe to it as well. versatile refreshing and roasty.
5051,Milk Stout,4.58,look: it may just be me but i think stouts are always the best looking beers so it’s always gonna be a 5  smell: chocolate coffee smells like one of those starbucks nitro shot things  taste: like a mocha coffee sweet this is one of the best tasting beers. but he warned it’s very sweet  feel: lingers a bit too long imo but still very nice  overall: this is a damn good stout. i’m so glad my local liquor store has this. highly recommend.
5052,Milk Stout,3.75,i went to college in boulder and i don’t understand why this is so popular but it’s cool. became the standard for normal milk stout.
5053,Milk Stout,4.07,i poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. a one inch head melted into a thin sheet within minutes but still provided moderate lacing. the aroma is quite pleasant. chocolate roasted barley coffee milk and a vanilla-like sweetness prevail. the resultant effect bears a faint barrel-aged resemblance. the taste is about what you expect from the nose. the roasted barley blends well with moderate hops and the milk sweetens the chocolatey stout. i expected a stickier consistency but the mouthfeel is nicely balanced... the taste and feel is quite clean and refreshing compared to a typical stout. i find left hand milk stout a compelling choice among dark sweet stouts on the market and the 6% abv is right on target for what i desired from this brew.
5054,The Greenest Green,4.6,pours a milky yellow orange with a fluffy off-white head. taste is sweeter than some of the other members of the green family but thats countered by a pithy bitterness. that bitterness is less immediate than other greens but seems more long-lasting maybe due to the creamy mouth-coating body.  overall a beautifully done treehouse dipa
5055,The Greenest Green,4.9,#175 yummy!
5056,The Greenest Green,4.53,this one pours a very hazy glowing orange color with a small head and lots of lacing.  there’s a ton of funky and sweet pineapple on the nose here some tropical fruit orange tangerine and just the lightest floral aroma.  green is a perennial favorite from tree house and this is the stickiest and most greentastic version of that i’ve had yet. it’s just super saturated and thick with hop character without tasting syrupy. there’s loads of the expected pineapple and mango here with tons of orange and tangerine citrus and very little bitterness. it’s just got that extra little push beyond green or very green – it’s not a full on uppercut but it’s definitely a hard shove.  this is thick and creamy with a wonderful drinkability and no hint at all of the 8.8% abv.  it’s honestly old hat at this point this is wonderful of course it is. tree house has come out of the other side of their expansion extremely successfully.
5057,The Greenest Green,4.49,serving: can canned: jul-27-2023 consumed: aug-13-2023  pours an orangey yellow with lots of haze and a middling white head. little lacing. nose is pineapple and bitter orange resiny oils little detectable malt presence. the flavor is a wee little burst of the rinds of those fruits followed by a big (but shortlived) wave of those same fruits… but this time just their bitter oily perfumey aromatics. this then dissipates into a lingering bitter hop buzz and not much else. the mouthfeel is less of that classic round fluffy juiciness and more total hop saturation. that said it is quite pleasant and doesnt venture into sappy or hop burny or astringent territory. as it warms some of the hoppy-yeasty estery sweetness as well as a scoche of malt character come out but even then it is a one-two-three punch (thats a thing right?) of the two main facets of the hops: sweetbitter-bittersweet-bitter in quick succession. regardless of any way the the beer could be better this back and forth shift with ever sip is extremely enjoyable and impressive to have pulled off from a brewing perspective.  in looking through my reviews of a few of its predecessors i can see how it is a clear extension of them. the main thing i notice is that in previous amped-up versions the fruity sweetness held its own and offered a foil to the bitter resinous palate shellac potential contained within the hop profile.  in this particular beer though the bitter oiliness has overtaken the rest and i have to really seek out the non-bitter aspects of it.  they say on the can that this is a result of their series to see how far they could push the envelope before it was too much. yeah i could see that. interesting to have this bitter of a treehouse beer.  4.25...4.5...4.5...4.5...4.5
5058,The Greenest Green,4.22,tried in hyannis 8/8/23
5059,Head Hunter,4.23,12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99 plus tax. canned on 05/15/23 so this beer is almost three months old.  look: it has a nice orange gold color with a half finger of beige colored head. the beer is fairly clear however it is unfiltered and there is a slight haziness / chill haze.  smell: lots of resinous pine and citrus (grapefruit and orange) notes. also dried pineapple. this smells really nice i wouldnt mind wearing fragrance that smelled like this. theres a subtle darker biscuit malt underneath all of the hops. spicy notes along with some paint thinner. subtle green bell pepper on the finish. more fruitiness comes through on the nose as i get into it and as the beer warms up. i ultimately get a nice sweet cantaloupe note along with lots of orange zest.  taste: ooooh this is seriously intense! they weren\t kidding when they said aggressively hopped west-coast ipa! it has a bit of that enamel-stripping character that scares you at first and then ultimately endears you. i\s actually really nice and while it is very bitter on the finish it still has very clean flavors on the palate and the bitterness doesn\t linger too long. it also has a nice caramel malt character to stand up to the piney resinous hops and bitterness. so it\s actually fairly balanced for such an aggressively hopped beer. quite impressive and enjoyable.  feel: it has a medium to medium plus mouthfeel with a bit of chewiness. very clean.  overall: its really good. i kind of liken this beer to a stronger version of sierra nevada celebration ale. for such a bitter and resinous beer its actually quite drinkable and refreshing! this is just my second fat heads brewery & saloon beer. good stuff.  from the website: hops: simcoe centennial mosaic citra chinook malt: pale c-15 carapils carahell wheat yeast: american ale beginning gravity: 16.8 plato ending gravity: 3.0 plato color: deep golden
5060,Head Hunter,4.31,enjoyed a pint with lunch after visiting the pro football hall of fame 8-9-23 for $5.50.  beer was served golden orange with a nice white head.  nose was a nice combination of tropical and citrus fruits.  taste was new school ipa with a not quite imperial sized malt base that displays nice flavorful hops that give notes of orange grapefruit mango and some strawberry finishing with a nice piney bitterness; 6/10 on my scale.  mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and refreshing.  overall a delicious wcipa this is dangerously crushable!
5061,Head Hunter,4.24,i consulted the top-rated beers list for ohio on this site before taking a road trip. this beer was #21 on the list with thousands of reviews so i had to find some. this is a superior ipa. nice fresh scent when i first poured it and lots of foam that lasted. a little hazy dark amber color. this was hoppy but i’ve had more intense hop taste; even so this was delicious. i tasted grapefruit and maybe some orange or lemon. nice mouth feel. should have bought more. next road trip…
5062,Head Hunter,4.21,poured from a 12 oz can dated 6/23/23 into a pint glass. l - pours a medium amber color with a fluffy white head that dissipates slowly. s - smells of pine and citrus. t - tastes bitter citrusy and dank. f - medium body and carbonation. o - very nice west coast ipa.
5063,Head Hunter,4.87,clear deep gold nice white head great retention rings of lace melon mango grapefruit lychee native grape aroma taste follows smell just enough malt to keep it balanced nice mid-range sweetness lingering bitter finish medium bodied clean appropriately carbonated this beer is near perfect for a west coast ipa
5064,Head Hunter,4.35,solid west coast style ipa. strong hops aroma with great bittering.
5065,Head Hunter,4.64,very nice. great hops. nice dry finish.
5066,Head Hunter,4.27,cloudy yellow-gold color with nice white head. super piney but also juicy flavors of mango orange grapefruit and pineapple. overall really fantastic when fresh on tap.
5067,Head Hunter,4.56,tasted from a 16 oz can acquired in ohio.  l - light gold color with very slight haze and constant mesmerizing streams of tiny bubbles that constantly rise through the beer. huge pillowy frothy off-white head that lasts and lasts.  s - big hops aromas of grapefruit and mandarin orange but with another earthy note similar to pineapple. there is a bit of bready malt in the finish very restrained like a saltine cracker.  t - strong citrusy hops hit the mouth immediately with navel orange grapefruit and pine. the hop flavors are aggressive as hell and leave no room for malt to shine through. exceptionally clean fermentation with no yeast fruitiness noted.  f - medium body with a bit of mouth-coating effect yet somehow the finish feels dry. moderate to high carbonation gives a fizzy impression on the tongue. hops bitterness strong enough to peel paint. alcohol presence fairly high which matches the listed abv but the strength seems appropriate with all the other heightened sensory inputs.  o - this is a world-class american ipa on the aggressive end of the styles spectrum. it slams your senses unapologetically and i love it for that.
5068,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.08,poured from a bottle into a snifter. lightly sweet. some brown sugar fruit and berry. medium body and carbonation. great beer to step away from stouts and ipa for an evening.
5069,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.3,can’t believe i haven’t rated this classic before. i’ve definitely had it in the past but not for years so i picked up a nicely priced (10.99) corked and caged 750 bottled in 2021.  this beer looks phenomenal with a very dark brown body (approaching black) and a tan head of tightly clustered bubbles that retains strongly and leaves creamy sheeting on the inside of the glass. the smooth fullness of the body with moderate carbonation is also a very high point. i was actually surprised at the restrained effervescence as for me it’s dead on and lively without getting too spritzy which i’ve encounter with many other belgian beers. i actually uncorked this near the sink to be on the safe side but no issues whatsoever there.  nose is the weaker side of this beer nothing bad here but simply understated and mild hints of dark chocolate bready malt restrained alcohol raisin. on the palate the alcohol is again present but contained in a very pleasant way sweet dark fruit and chocolate predominant subtler vinous qualities and suggestion of baking spices. unfolds gradually revealing depths of flavor as it warms.  what a treat. i love to mix it up with an old school european classic now and then and this fit the bill fantastically on a chilly early spring evening.
5070,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,5,best beer in the world and there are so many awesome competitors (thank goodness)
5071,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.22,appearance: served up an opaque mahogany-toned body dressed with a persistent lofty beige head with a lovely-looking sheets of lacing on the way down.  smell: spiced plum-infused port with a gooey brown sugar glaze atop a dark pumpernickel breadiness garnished with a sliver of bitter orange.  taste: broiled brown sugar and treacle with a dash of chocolate powder - soundly sweet. dark bready toasted quality. a hint of vanilla with spicy touches of cinnamon mace and pepper aided by the firm mature guiding hands of the warming alcohol presence. dark fruitiness accented with some berry notes. rich slightly sweet finish.  mouthfeel: medium-plus body. medium carbonation. its just sticky enough and lush enough.  overall: hearty nicely complex; makes for a solid sipper.
5072,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.2,750ml bottle into a teku. 2021 release a year old.  looks very nice. almost black body deep red wine when held up to the light. decent tan head replenishes well with each pour. does shrink to a ring and faint covering great lacing.  sweet caramel aroma lots of dark skinned fruit a touch of alcohol.  on tasting first off its certainly on the sweet side caramel and boiled candy. however there are enough nuances to cut through this. dark skin fruit warming and more to come in the finish.  mouth a little foamy close to full. finish very complex. sweet caramel to be sure but the warmth fruit dryness even a light bitter touch are all enjoyed.  overall a thoughtfully well made beer. thanks to het anker for putting this out every year for us to enjoy.
5073,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.42,from the 750ml bottle in a snifter. this awesome brew pours a dark and muddled brown with ruby highlights and a fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring thick clumping layer and sports exceptional lacing. nose of date plum fig mulled prune subtle alcohol ester notes and sweet belgian candy sugars / brown sugar. flavors hit the mark with plum fig date stewed prune cola notes dark cherry cranberry dark sweet bread and dark belgian candy sugars. nice mouth feel; medium body medium light carbonation that is nicely effervescent yet soft and a sweet yet balanced finish that is all and all perfect.  overall----if i had to have just one brew all the time this one would be in the running! exceptional as always!  cheers
5074,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.5,pours a deep brown with a finger of mocha head. nose is brown sugar molasses alcohol bite and toasted malt. taste follows suit with deep undertones of black cherry and prunes. feel is full and thick. overall well above average. best beer i’ve had in a while.
5075,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.51,a: murky deep dark red/brown/purple mixture. seeing some pale brown when held up to a light. no real head to speak of though it has a tan film around the edge of the glass; to be expected with the abv i suppose  s: huge aroma on this. fig plum raisins prunes. molasses brown sugar leather and something like a roasted robust woody note. lots of sweet caramel fruit bread and candied strawberries. huge malty backbone. fantastic aroma  t: oh my this follows the nose pretty close. huge caramel and fig upfront. plums raisins molasses brown sugar behind that. big bready backbone. fruit bread and caramel red apples. a little bit of sweet cherry juice as well. no real alcohol presence which is impressive given the abv  m: full mouthfeel with strong carbonation  o: absolutely fantastic beer. the rating on here is definitely deserved - this should be a benchmark for the style. so robust and complex while hiding its abv. a great beer to share
5076,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.21,pours brown with ruby highlights. the foamy tan head diminishes pretty quickly after pouring. big time nose of raisins and figs. very smooth on the palate--a nice medium-bodied ale. told it ages well but couldnt resist this 2021 effort early in 2022. for a younger ale of this type it was very smooth even without too much additional aging. the flavors are rich and as they are described primarily dark fruit (plums) caramel and gently roasted malts. a treat worthy of an emperor.
5077,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,5,this is my favorite beer of all time!
5078,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.45,canned december 14 2017 with the bottom of the can stamped vulcans 4 life  ok...lets see how this ~6 year old beer has held up. appearance wise the answer is quite well. stouts almost all look the same to me but thats not a bad thing. deepest brown / black but what i was pleasantly surprised with was the thick beige head that showed good retention before settling into a permanent ring and cap.  aroma is a nice blend of roast and sweetness. cocoa roasted malts and vanilla-like aromas. nice smelling beer.  taste is where the age of the beer is showing up. i think time has likely stripped away what i imagine were a more congruous set of ingredients. whats left is a little bit like bitter cocoa mixed into a thin base beer.  overall this is not particularly enjoyable. i will have to try it fresh. certainly cant blame the brewer for the fact that this languished in my cellar for way too long.
5079,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.27,pours a dark cola color and settles as black in the glass with a dense dark tan head. the nose includes a nice amount of rich cocoa along with roasty char notes and a bit of stone fruit.  the taste is amped up with that rich cocoa and roasty char syncing nicely with the dark cherry flavor to present a really flavorful imperial stout that improves as it warms.  the mouthfeel is a bit thinner than i’d like to see with a beer of this magnitude. still a very nice representation of the style that i’d gladly revisit again and again.
5080,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.34,jet black body opaque; thick frothy light tan head. rich sweet aroma; dark roasted grains; cocoa and chocolate; dark roast coffee. the taste follows along with and amplifies the smell characteristics; milk chocolate and coffee; moderate bitterness throughout; mild booziness. heavy body; smooth and glassy; silky; slight alcohol dryness offsetting the overall sweetness.  a wonderful imperial stout that delivers a lot of sensory goods.  pouring temperature: 48 °f; canning data: laugh it up fuzzball 11/08/21
5081,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.8,great beer. world class to be honest. all malt does the job - roasted character big malty body bitter but sweet that roast malt bitterness. a lot of espresso some mild chocolatey character. its a great beer it harkens to the best of the all malt stuff out there and at a really good price point.
5082,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.61,this is one of the best ad-junk free stouts i have ever had the pleasure to drink. poured black as the empire’s ill will with a medium brown short and dense head that left regular lacing. smelled faint to my nose but that’s normal what i did get was malty goodness. the taste was excellent full and rich in depth of malts very little bitterness at all. so good. the feel ideally weighted for the style encourages a slow pace but begs for another sip. oa really enjoyed this one if you can find it try it!
5083,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.58,thanks to roguer for this one. 12 oz can (dated laugh it up fuzzball 11/8/21) poured into 14oz teku. poured a solid and dense black color with 3/4 inch of medium brown color that had very good retention and very light lacing.  strong roast at the front of the nose yet it didnt border on coffee. solid malts and a light bit of chocolate were behind the roast.  similar on the tongue with the roast coming across a bit stronger and lingering on the finish.  the body was fairly typical for the style; smooth even and with a finish that started sweet but dried out nicely.  drinkability was good especially on this wet rainy stormy late autumn day here in the pnw.  overall a very well done example of the style. would be in rotation if local to me. a must-try if you see it.
5084,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.17,11/29/21 canned 11/10. liked much better than the taste @ neb. roasted malt. espresso. nicely balanced. not sweet or bitter. go to stout.
5085,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.96,it’s a very good stout. rich dark heavy. potent.
5086,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.25,brew: new england brewing co.– imperial stout trooper  intro: 750 mil. poured into a tulip glass. shared with a friend.  appearance: pitch black opaque. generous head and lacing that remained through the pour.  smell: rich malty aroma not cluttered by “addjunks”. no barrel aging just grains and lots of them  taste: followed aroma. roasted grains maybe a hint of chocolate but no barrel no coconut no gummy bears. just old school stout. quite refreshing in today’s time  mouthfeel: medium mouthfeel. leaves a slight film of aftertaste of the roasted grain.  drink: very enjoyable to have a change of pace from all the “addjunks”. it’s a sipper one that will take a session to consume.  conclusion: i was very pleased to have the opportunity to try this one. it ticked off a top stouts list and it also ticked off a connecticut beer. on top of that it tasted great and didn’t leave me feeling bloated. definitely try it if you run across it.
5087,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.47,500ml bottle bottled 12/2014  a- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge  s- bold roasted malt on the nose gives aromas of chocolate molasses rum soaked raisins stewed figs black licorice brownies and caramelized sugar. even picking up some port-like aromas  t- bold flavors of chocolate roasted barley figs dates and raisins to open. mid-palate gives notes of black strap molasses anise prunes black cherry and char. the finish gives a hint of faded hops as well as dark chocolate roast and fig on the linger  m- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that turns into a thick and velvety slightly warming finish  o- you just dont find very many great straight up riss these days. this has held up remarkably well and is still better than most of the better riss available today.
5088,Sip Of Sunshine,3.57,i cannot believe that this beer is so highly rated. it is good but far from world class.
5089,Sip Of Sunshine,4.75,poured from the pounder into a nonic pint  a: relatively clear straw gold with a nice thick head that dissipates to a wispy collar and a few islands of thin clouds.  s: tropical fruit and some lemongrass hints. no strong malts to speak of.  t: beautiful bitter notes of underripe stonefruit and pineapple.  m: smooth and slick with a good bit of dryness then a slick finish.  o: if i ever had a near 5ish this is it in ipas
5090,Sip Of Sunshine,3.84,like but it’s vermont cousins at the alchemist are still better.
5091,Sip Of Sunshine,4.27,on tap. bright golden yellow with a brighter white head of sticky foam. good staying power and lacing. aroma is clean and softly sweet hints of lemon and sugar dusted pineapple this beer smiles and invites you in politely. flavor is balanced mix of lager-like malt and white pepper hop bite. long and mellow hop character in balance with the mild sweet roll flavors and stewed fruit notes with just a hint of alcohol. clean balanced and well made is the best way to describe this very session-able but slightly boring big beer.
5092,Sip Of Sunshine,4.51,poured from a bottle into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. the head has a decent level of retention fading over time and leaving a moderate sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma is very strong of a sweet grapefruit and tangerine smell mixed with notes of papaya and some herb. there is also a rather strong peach and apricot smell mixed with some lighter smells of pear and biscuit malt. taste – the taste begins with a nice smooth tangerine and bready malt flavor mixed with the grapefruit hop that was in the nose. there is a touch of herbal and pine hop at the start as well but these are very light in comparison to the grapefruit hop flavor. other flavors of a light honeydew melon and a decent showing of mango and papaya are there as well with the ladder fruit getting more intense as the taste advances. a light floral hop and a bit of grain develop at the very end leaving one with a smooth and rather citrus strong taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is on the lighter and thinner side for a 8 % abv brew with a moderate carbonation. for the big citrus and fruit flavors the feel is quite nice making for a nice and dangerously easy sipper. overall – a very pleasant drinking citrus forward and highly flavorful ipa. a quite well crafted and very tasty brew.
5093,Sip Of Sunshine,4.4,poured into a seattle beer week pint glass. pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. aroma of caramel malt citrus and tropical fruit hops orange pineapple and mixed tropical fruit and a little pine. flavor is lightly caramel malt citrus tropical fruit an piney hops grapefruit and orange rind pine needles mild mixed tropical fruit and some dankness. a somewhat different piney and citrus rind flavor develops in the finish with great aggressive bitterness. medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. i guess with the market domination of hazy ne style ipas out here in the west i kinda thought the east coast would be a wasteland of hazies. ive been lucky enough to get several fine ipas from out east and im now convinced that good old non-hazies are available there too. this is a fine example. not quite a west coast profile but lots of the citrus and pine i crave. lots of herbal hop flavor. i am especially happy about the flavor change about mid-taste where strong pine takes over from the citrus and fruit but a somewhat different mixed fruit note is revealed behind the almost resinous pine. appropriately namedthis is a bright cheerful ipa id love to drink again.
5094,Sip Of Sunshine,4.25,sorry to report (because it will be even harder to snap up when it gets to local shelves) sip of sunshine is a great ipa it is fkn delicious!
5095,Redd's Apple Ale,3.8,very good if you think about it asalcoholic beverage not so much as a beer in feel/taste. i prefer drinking this apple ale to most hard ciders and its great in the fall or on a summer evening
5096,Redd's Apple Ale,1,too sweet. cant taste any hops or malt whatsoever
5097,Redd's Apple Ale,3.71,almost like an apple flavored mikes hard lemonade
5098,Redd's Apple Ale,4.8,why redds doesnt sell as well as angry orchard is beyond me. has anyone actually bothered to sit down and try this? not only does redds actually have an apple taste to it but its smooth crisp and refreshing! just keep it refrigerated overnight put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes and youre in hard cider heaven!  seriously angry orchard is so watered down compared to redds.
5099,Redd's Apple Ale,2,de color dorado con una espuma jabonosa de poca retención. cuerpo ligero y carbonatación media. aroma manzana verde y algo de cereal. en boca tiene notas dulces y un final levemente ácido.
5100,Vintage Ale,3.91,{2018 vintage ale}
5101,Vintage Ale,5,review 3000!  enjoyed at the end of 2022 bottle no. 143884  pours a wonderful caramel-burgundy with a thick layer of cocoa colored foam on top. the aroma is fantastic with layers of stone fruit plummy jammy raisin with hints of dark chocolate leather and tobacco on the end. the sip follows creamy with a lingering finish. subtly sweet with an effervescence that keeps it lively. a delightful sipper. utterly fantastic.
5102,Vintage Ale,4.66,had 2010 bottle that has been cellared 12 years. at last i finally got to try this one only took coming to london itself! pours dark brown and murky with a short lived tan cap. nose has a sherry note to it the wife say cognac either way this sweeter booziness is met with caramel oxidized apricot date barley and leather. taste adds a bevy of dark fruit golden raisin and a kiss of fresh cut hay on the end with the old yeast. so luxuriously smooth sneaky light quenching and dry with a whisper of resin. this one is special for its style. paired wonderfully with a pub sunday roast
5103,Vintage Ale,4.21,2019 vint bottle 06240. poured at fridge temp into a snifter. there’s a casual head that lasts only a little while. color is dark amber. smell is sweet malt stone fruit light caramel. taste is cherry-ish sweet toffee. hops are evident but balance well within the overall profile. no real bitterness to be found. feel is light carbonation smooth. overall despite being bottle conditioned i can’t imagine that anything else would develop by cellaring this beauty any longer. it’s packaging presentation look feel and taste are spot-on right now.
5104,Vintage Ale,4.21,2016 vintage drank in 2022. amazingly rich flavor and solid carbonation. complex and delicious!
5105,Vintage Ale,4.5,2021 vintage bottle #139563....  a- pours a lovely orange hued dark bronze color is semi opaque and the head which is about two fingers thick shows a shade of creamy white with toffee infusion. the carbonation appears to be somewhat mellow with only a few columns slumbering there way upward with the lacing showing rather well and stickily. i am being painted a grouping of cave art like animals around the inside of the glass....very nice looking overall!  s- heavy malt profile here with plenty of caramel/toffee sweetness dark fruit flesh such as plum and fig richness various citrus nuances (tangerine blood orange grapefruit pomello) and a sweet alcoholic nature of rum soaked raisins. the finish has some interesting fruity bitter hops which would explain what i read about the experimental cf182 variety being used here....i even detect some pineapple tropical like aromas on the end!  t- very well balanced overall with a wonderful blend of toffee/caramel malt sweetness rummy raisin/plum/fig richness slight orchard fruitiness. after i get through all of this my palate is hit once again by a second round of malt bomb....full of sweet cooked brown sugar dark toffee molasses sugarcane and dulce de leche. the finish showcases some very british flavors found in traditional pale ales.....zesty citrus peel tropical fruitiness and dry leafy herbal tones quenching the palate and leading me on to want more!  m/o- ive enjoyed aged vintages from fullers before and this is the first time i\ve had one right after release....i have to say that i am impressed with the overall flavors and richness for something so fresh. the carbonation is smooth and allows the full flavors to release onto the palate gently while the body is somewhere in the medium-full range. the alcohol is incredibly well hidden and soft for an 8.5% brew but i don\t believe this would be something with a high drinkability factor....one is plenty in a sitting. i appreciate the usage of experimental hops and the attempt to create something unique which i think fits the bill here.....overall this is an exceptional english style pale ale and would become a great old ale after several years of aging!
5106,Vintage Ale,4.18,this one isn’t hog wild - and it isn’t supposed to be. but what i feel what it does to me is remind me of a gentle moment. a moment with her; not the one that was meant for me but one that still gave me that night and made me feel. i’ll always remember you baby even if you aren’t in my trophy case.  be well my children.
5107,Vintage Ale,3.39,500 ml bottle. vintage 2020. pours murky amber. smells of... cardboard right off the bat. spicy hops with some berry fruitiness behind it. deep caramel undertones. tastes of sweet caramel with a combination of spicy and again berry fruity hops. cardboard isnt as noticeable here as its got a pronounced hop bitterness. still has a little bit though. medium heavy fairly sweet. not boozy but hits hard after a few sips. i picked this up because i havent seen one in a long time. my memory of this is fonder than the current experience.
5108,Vintage Ale,4.34,2021 vintage excellent 2017 vintage
5109,Vintage Ale,4.37,teste licorice smoke sweet pastry. smells berries. light carbonation small head. color is cloudy black tea.
5110,Vintage Ale,4.24,beautifully clear copper-red under a well-retaining khaki head that slowly settles to an unevenly bubbly yet flat collar.  while it may be mildly unfair for me to rate this 2010 bottle straight up its clearly intended for extensive aging which i dont feel caused it much detriment anyway.  that said it exhibits distinct characteristics of grape and prune and as such lands well within the intended range of emulating wine. these characteristics are accented by softly light notes of pumpernickel and melba toast before exhaling floral tobacco.  the body is smoothly slick with a lightly soft carbonation that fines out into a faintly tingling slightly numbing semi-dry finish. over time that leafy floral tobacco verges into cigar skin to delicately dry the palate out further.
5111,Vintage Ale,4.28,amber with a touch of red and a finger of tan foamy head. cherries tart apples on the nose with caramel tangerine almond toffee and malt at the end. you really have to work to pick things out though. the caramel and malt show up big in the taste. there is bread pudding with raisins and brown sugar. medium bitterness closes this out. the feel is light carbonation and a nice creaminess. i love the bread pudding aspect of this. i would totally drink this again and would recommend.
5112,Vintage Ale,4.76,2020 vintage  nice traditional and luxurious packaging nice collectible bottle. pours a lovely deep mahogany slightly hazy with two smooth fingers of off-white beige-tinged head that recede slowly and shockingly stick around for the entire pint despite the 8.5% alcohol content which took me over 20 minutes to finish. the smell whollops you over the head with fruits like blackberry and plum. ethanol is present but far from obtrusive. the dark fruit profile carries forward into the taste complemented by marmalade chocolate notes subtle caramel and even subtler earthy zesty hops. the mouthfeel is smooth as silk the ethanol noticeable - at 8.5% theres no way around that - but incorporated into the flavour profile. overall a delicious complex smooth and very special beer.
5113,Vintage Ale,4.51,2011.
5114,Vintage Ale,4.08,2014 vintage  appearance - pours hazy and burnt amber in color. sandstone colored finger width head that holds for a minute or so before scaling down to a thin broken layer of suds on the surface thickening up around the edge of the glass. fair lacing with some streaky lines and small spots making up most of it.  smell - raisin and toffee upfront with some caramel oak nutty character and some booze.  taste - follows the nose. toffee and raisin hit the palate first with lesser caramel oak and maybe even a hint of chocolate mid-taste. finish adds some mild acidic booze and a bit of almond reminiscent of sherry and the aftertaste is a nice easy blend of the aforementioned flavors easing out slowly.  mouthfeel - light-to-medium in body with low carbonation. drinks smooth enough though does seem a bit thin. perhaps due to the 7 years of age its been afforded.  overall - nice old ale. it doesnt quite do it for me like north coast old stock which is more full-bodied and flavored but it does have some similar qualities. i wouldnt mind trying this fresh or with a few years of age on it though it looks like they change up the hop profile every year.
5115,La Fosse,4.3,#185 just ok
5116,La Fosse,4.54,look - haze yellow fantastic rimming and lacing smell - tart stone fruit like apricot peach taste - candied tart apricot just delicious feel - medium body and fizz medium carb overall - delicious
5117,La Fosse,4.4,375ml bottle. label has 2022 vintage. cloudy straw colored body. brief white head. no lacing. aroma is apricot and wild ale. leather pear and peach. taste is apricot with leather grassy and white grape. medium mouth feel. dry finish. okay carbonation. sublime nose and flavors with apricot as the base note.
5118,La Fosse,4.45,purchased a bottle of this beer at the brewery in march.  poured into a tulip glass. hazy yellow color with brief effervescent white head with little lacing. smell and taste of ripe tart fruit. apricot and peaches. tart but a mellow smooth flavor. nice full feel. wonderfully refreshing. excellent wild ale.
5119,La Fosse,4.49,taking inspiration from famous brussels apricot sour ale side project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style.  la fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour. but the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit funk and fauna. a scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer sourdough and a brief hint of taffy.  but anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate. the session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange mango and peach character. shying away from fruit rollup the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay bubbly dryness and a piquant spice. its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa burlap and extended wood-age white wine.  light crisp and highly refreshing the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more brussels brewed versions but this brighter cleaner and fruitier version is just as good.
5120,La Fosse,4.5,finally made it for a visit to side project and they happened to have bottles of this for on-site so got one and no regearts! sour but not too sour and just fully of ripe juicy apricot flavor; glad i got it!
5121,La Fosse,4.51,drank as part of a beer tasting with ron. not sure about the price. cool bottle neat cap. consumed on 04/07/23 review from notes.  a&s: the beers appearance is bright orange at first and moves to a muddy orange as the remaining beer and sediment are poured in. the head is fizzy and big there is some lacing. the aroma is powerful! chalky yeast tart peaches and apricots.  t&m: the taste is acidic fruity tart and lemony. very clean. cereal finish. tartness is cleared out when the sediment is poured in and the funk comes through more than before. the high carbonation is champagne-like at first then comes in a little more creamy later on.  overall: it is one of the better beers i have ever had. perfect for a warm summer day.
5122,Gallo Draft,2.12,pretty bad.
5123,Gallo Draft,3.07,a54 a55
5124,Gallo Draft,1.21,this is literally the second worst beer i have ever had. if youre ever in guatemala take your own beer. looks like piss smells like sour skunk and not the good kind tastes worse feels like a decent-ish macro so its go that going for it  you should try it if you go to guatemala but only for that nostalgic moment of so when i was in guatemala i had this horrible beer called gallo...
5125,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,2.62,poured from a clear 40 best by june 5th 2023  on a relatively hard pour 2 fingers of dense sticky head form that becomes rocky and over time surprisingly slowly fades. body is a deep verging on dark golden yellow. surprisingly decent lacing forms. good head quality and retention.  aroma is not quite present. acetaldehyde green apple is very present with a dry light graininess in the back. maybe a bit skunky but not quite as much as oe800. smells like cheap beer that got warm.  taste is a bit more smooth than the aroma with a touch of bready and biscuity malt but only after the aforementioned acetaldehyde bitter/tart/off apple flavor passes. the flavor is not as sweet as steel reserve and not as sweet as hurricane but the acetaldehyde is just a bit too much. still drinkable.  feel is actually quite decent especially for the abv. not too heavy or syrupy but the feel is obviously full bodied. there is a definite dryness and astringency that grows as you drink. very drinkable if not quite refreshing. definitely a laid back lazy day sorta beer.  overall its a decent high gravity lager but i do slightly prefer steel reserve over this. closing words its fine but drink it cold.
5126,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.57,for the malt liquor category st. ides isn’t all too bad if drank ice cold. it will get you loopy real quick cause it hits you like a ton of bricks but then again so does the hangover….  anywho it’s worth a shot for anyone whose in a budget or has a few extra bucks left over to just blow. blow it in a 40oz of st. ides. you look even more cool consuming it in a brown paper bag
5127,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,4.09,drank from a 40 ounce glass bottle. scores are based on the style.  look - that label is perfect. its a flawless design and i love it. yes its dated but thats even more reason to love it. good colors good font good everything.  smell - not much of anything just a slight corny sweetness.  taste - buttery shortbread cookies and refreshing malt flavor. no off-putting bitterness and surprisingly little alcohol taste for the high abv. an easy drinker.  feel - smooth and silky. just the right amount of carbonation. goes down good.  overall - one of my favorite malt liquors ive had. i will always stand by mickeys but this definitely gives it a run for its money.
5128,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.53,40 ounce clear glass screw top bottle poured into vintage pub glass. dated mar0821 (2 weeks from now) 8.2% abv and listing the corporation address in milwaukee wi. the beer pours bright light honey amber in color with nearly white head. the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. the aroma is cooked grain slightly vegetable. the taste is sweet slick corn sugary liquor. minimal to zero bitterness. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a decidedly undry finish. overall ok malt liquor. the diacetyl is not overpowering and awful here. also not the cleanest example and not one i would purchase again.
5129,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,4.85,shame this has such a low rating. pansies. poured into a frosty mug out of a 40 oz bottle. because... you cant get a good proper aroma in the 40. sue me. anyhow. aroma: wonderful malty hint of movie popcorn with butter. is that really that bad when there are beers out now intended on tasting like peanut butter or smelling like grapefruit? no. not at all. cry about it! appearance: wonderful head like my ex gave before she wrecked my life and married some other guy in 4 months. in all seriousness beautiful appearance in a mug. looks like a macro beer in an advertisement. darker color than most aals. instagram worthy. taste: ice cold? smooth crisp hides the potency of the girthy liquid quite well. warmed up a bit? good. yes. good. dont be a stereotypical snob. there are floral notes here along with some hoppy characteristics. tastes like it would cost you 3 times more with some crazy label touting independence from the big bad macro evil guys. because it is hip to be square. right? buzz: you need a buzz rating. if you don\t do one you\re lying to yourself... if you consumed a beer of high abv and posted a review on some godforsaken website. like i did! 10/10. increases luck with the ladies much added confidence. hey it\s how i met my ex mentioned earlier one st ides and i was in 3 hour sex romps and meeting a totally dysfunctional family from the seventh layer of hell before i knew it! don\t take my word for it. get you a 40 oz of st ides today before pabst kills off this legacy brand to help fight racism or some such trite shit. it is good. and it gets you feeling like you discovered liquid weed. also helps you deal with an insane sociopath destroying your life with her delusions! incredible brew.
5130,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.59,pours a clear dark yellow with minimal head that dissipated quickly high carbonation. the smell is very malty sweet aroma. the taste is malt forward as expected caramel sweetness some graininess and a surprising slight hop bitterness also boozy as the alcohol comes through with this one. mouthfeel is crisp easy drinkability with a slight boozy warmness. overall dead on for the style of a malt liquor/strong lager. there is no pretense with this beer it is exactly what you would expect.
5131,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.66,40 ounce bottle into lager glass best before 4/6/2020. pours fairly crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. aromas of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honey wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. some fruity corn aromas but not too overwhelming. okay aromas with pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with decent strength. taste of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honey wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. light-moderate herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honey wood pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. moderately crisp/clean finishing. very clean on lager flavors with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. minimal warming alcohol for 5.9%. overall this is a nice malt liquor. all around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth crisp clean and pretty refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. very clean and nicely rich pils malt/grain showcase with nice earthy hop presence/balance for the style. not too overwhelming on adjuncts. a nicely enjoyable offering and impressive style example as expected of pabst.
5132,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,2.35,oh man do i have memories of this beer lol good times.
5133,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.1,purchased at some crummy gas station next to where my friend works. drank straight from the 40.  this is pretty harsh stuff for the first few sips. it has a pronounced alcohol taste and its pretty heavily carbonated compared to some of the other 40s ive tried.
5134,Sol,5,i may drink too much. choice of alcohol is lager beers thats it. have tried most oof them except the crappy ones like natural ice. lots of bud light and modelo and corona. this beer tastes like nothing to me but tastes like something good that doesnt taste like any other lager out there. i really like modelo but this beer is even easier to drink for me has a flavor that is not crappy but there is no flavor to it that makes it very easy to crush for me.
5135,Sol,4.11,from a clear bottle dates 02/24. pours a nice gold colour head doesnt last. smell is wet grains and some malt taste is sweeter with grain/some light white bread. good for style.
5136,Sol,2.7,sol is good don’t be a snob
5137,Sol,2.53,new mexican lager to me! clear 12oz bottle accompanying my chile colorado...pale straw-colored and completely transparent with minimal head and lacing. adjunct sweetness shines though not altogether bad...grains sweet malts...not mad at this for a mexican-food companion.
5138,Sol,2.23,i was surprised i had not reviewed this beer before. poured from a bottle into a tall pint glass. clear yellow color with decent initial white head and lacing. doesn’t smell like much a bit of corn. taste is boring corny but slightly refreshing. very thin. rather have a corona.
5139,Sol,1.4,calling this stuff beer is like calling a veggie burger a steak. however due to the low alcohol content it might be not too bad on a very hot day.
5140,Sol,1.47,looks clear and light golden. almost no smell at all. slight slight skunky cornbread smell in there. very light taste of carbonated water and hints of beer. this is not for me.
5141,Sol,3,the look is light golden hay. smells sweet and mildly hoppy taste is solid only beaten imo by dos equis for mexican beer. overall a solid mexican beer. however based on price would not be a go to.
5142,Sol,2.84,poured from a 32oz caguama bottle best by january 2023  on the pour fizzy looking bubbles come together to make a one finger head that quickly dissipates to a surprisingly fine covering over the top of the beer. the body is a light gold with lots of carbonation and some very light lacing.  smell is very light and almost not there bit what i can pick up is just corny malts and some skunked hops from the clear bottle. at least its clean apart from being light struck.  taste is a bit of a let down. once again very light. right on the very first sip there is a hit of bitterness that implies hops but that quickly fades as you drink and get used to it. there is a certain minerality and tartness as well that lingers until the malts fully take over about halfway into the sip. the hops dont taste fresh at all and are only providing bitterness and grass flavors. one again very clean with almost no yeast notes.  feel is actually decent being very drinkable and has some actual body to it although it is still very light once you get past the carbonation and head stage of the sip. the finish isnt as short as i wouldve expected for a beer this light amd it leaves you feeling malty and a bit boozy for a decent while after your sip.  overall its alright. you can do better from mexico but its about on par with all the other clear bottles that come from down there. victoria and tecate are both better and tecate is the same style too.
5143,Sol,3,drunk during my trip to silao (guanajuato méxico). usual bottle of the brand.  l: clear pale yellow an some gold. on top a thin head of white foam about 2 cm. tall; good collar and lacing  s: peaches bread some corn  t: more grain than bread malt. it has a lingering peach aftertaste that is good; no major hop in the brew.  f: light with a small amount of big-bubbled carbonation. after a while it comes off as heavier than a lightweight.  o: a light brew. i like it. usual mexican beer.
5144,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.02,vanilla cream banana clove apricot. chewy ends dry. very nice
5145,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.54,poured into a chilled glass at about 38f. pours a cloudy very light orange with an off-white head that sticks around for a while and leaves slight lacing. smell is typical wheat and yeast along with a slight musty bitterness that is actually quite pleasant. taste is very nice with slight banana wheat vanilla and yeast. very crisp and quite a dry finish. carbonation is fairly high which brings out the wheat character. overall great beer. ill buy again if my beer store doesnt have weihenstephaner hefeweissbier or vitus .
5146,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.71,no granite notes as in alot of heffeweizzen (which i know this is not. im just sayin...). crisp as a lager but depth and flavor of an ale. gesunheidt!
5147,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.39,from notes. pours a cloudy orange with a towering head. the smell is orange corianderhoney and yeast and taste follows on  everything rounded together really well. the mouthfeel is thick and creamy. overall tasty refreshing very pretty and a very good beer.
5148,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,3.42,12oz bottle poured into a teku glass. look is a somewhat hazy golden yellow with two fingers of white head. the head has fairly good retention. smell is a little below medium in strength. the smell of vanilla is slightly strongest and bfollowed by banana clove funk yeast and a musty smell. it has somewhat of a banana bread smell. the balance in the smell is outstanding but the musty smell lowers it to very good. taste is medium-low in strength. the taste follows the nose with the addition of a peppery taste. the flavor is very good. im very disappointed how light the flavor is. so the light flavor makes it good at best. feel is medium in thickness. theres barely any creaminess which is extremely unfortunate for this style. carbonation is medium. its somewhat dry. the lack of creaminess is unforgivable. overall this beer went down hill and then died with the feel. hefeweizens are my favorite beer style. after this six-pack i wont buy this beer again.
5149,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.99,my favorite of all german wheat beers. excellent taste aroma and feel. i have been drinking this beer since i was stationed in germany in the 80s and still love it.
5150,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.87,probably the best i have ever triedsimply outstanding smell and taste.
5151,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.36,opaque gold body with a large ivory colored head. bangs out trusted esters like clove and banana with little reliance on hops beyond some spiciness. flavor stays true to the style and tradition. smooth creamy deftly carbonated mouthfeel. one of the best if you like weissbiers.
5152,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.43,pours a beautiful hazy golden orange. bready aroma hints of banana. wonderful aftertaste. one of my favorite go to weissebiers.
5153,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.79,best weiss beer i’ve had outside of germany i’m in athens at a local italian restaurant and it’s served here in a chilled glass 500ml the look is a fantastic orange—brown it smells like bread baking fresh in the oven with hints of banana. the taste is so smooth yet complex with the different notes hitting at different times. must recommend to anyone who loves wheat beer!
5154,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.02,5/21/23 poured from a 12 oz bottle from the washington beer store.  nice hazy gold with a fair amount of initial head. scattered lacing.  not as chewy as weihenstephaner hefe not as complex but still very decent. aroma is stone banana bread and green apple.  taste follows aroma. malty finish with a slight effervescent bite on the tongue
5155,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.14,500ml. bottle in mae kasa thailand. pours a cloudy dark orange with a retentive head. aroma of wheat malts banana and yeast. taste of light citrus banana wheat bread. smooth creamy mouthfeel. a pleasant hefe.
5156,Pumking,4.77,best pumpkin imo
5157,Pumking,3.37,bourbony circus peanuts is the first thing that came to mind as i poured the light pumpkin orange translucence into the glass and it settled under two fingers of fast-dissipating cream-colored foam. a closer sniff said something closer to overripe bananas foster with a hint of nutmeg. nutmeg comes up first from a fairly rough mouth feel then something boozy and a little dry that overpowers any fruitiness. now it is certainly possible that this has lost a step since it has been sitting in my fridge for a couple months while i abstained from alcohol. while not the pumpkin beer i was looking for i will give it another go later this year with a fresh bottle.
5158,Pumking,4.58,delicious elegant complex smells great
5159,Pumking,4.2,beautiful amber orange with a tight-bubbled thin head. light pumpkin with notes of cinnamon brown sugar and strong nutmeg. beautifully creamy and smooth nutty pumpkin taste with a very natural pumpkin and cinnamon finish that sits warmly on the palette. light body with low carbonation thin ale. served in a snifter at world of beer; beautiful look and complex and well-balanced flavor.
5160,Pumking,3.78,well within its generous date range poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a samuel adams perfect pint glass.  appearance: pumpkin golden one-inch head that dissipated only gradually adequate lacing.  nose: sweet pumpkin and pumpkin spice inviting.  mouthfeel: medium heavy.  attack: pumpkin spice nicely balance by hops carbonation and alcohol evident.  finish: medium hop bitterness.  overall: this won a taste-off i hosted of various pumpkin ales a couple years ago and i have every confidence it would again. the only pumpkin ale i’d rate more highly is avery rumpkin (when you can find it) but it’s really in a whole different class.
5161,Pumking,3.66,light caramel in color with a slightly white head. cant discern too much immediate pumpkin notes that makes me think this is pumpkin pie in a glass. definitely some enjoyable cereal grain malt notes. it comes off as fairly boozy and at 8.6% it definitely is. i think this is a good beer but it\s not pumpkin pie in a glass as advertised. clove some nutmeg but lots of cereal grains and intermeshed bitter notes. i\m not sure what\s going on because a lot of reviews are saying this tastes extremely pumpkin pie like and others are decrying it as being watered down. i\m definitely in the latter camp because this is coming up pretty short in the sweet pumpkin pie regard. it is a good and strong imperial beer but comes off closer to a barleywine than a pumpkin ale. frankly there might be some quality control issues somewhere in the manufacturing or supply chain that are creating such a variance in assessments of this beer.
5162,Pumking,4.37,im not real wordy but this is good stuff. not a sweet as quaff on. tastes just like pumpkin pie slight bitterness. no head slightly cloudy. good stuff! i would buy again
5163,G'Knight,4.17,hazy red brew with an off-white head. hoppy nose evocative of grapefruit. rich thick malty sweetness -- also plenty of flowery fruity hoppiness. warming. this would have enthralled me in the 90s. today im into subtler beers.
5164,G'Knight,3.99,draught nearly clear medium dark orange with the slightest auburn tint. nice allspice tinged medium dark toast caramel malt with a bit of fruitiness to the aroma. some sharpness upfront lightly astringent bit of allspice/coriander type sweet spice in the background with a bit of a floral note to the taste and finish.
5165,G'Knight,4.25,appearance - the beer poured a brownish maroon color with a white head.  smell - the smell malts and dank hops were just right for the style.  taste - the malts backbone was huge leaving a trail of sweetness. the dank and grassy hops provided a nice contrast. nothing was overpowering and a dry finish left me thirsty for more.  mouthfeel - the beer was full bodied allowing the aftertaste to linger.  overall - it has been too long since i had this one.
5166,G'Knight,4.27,terrific red imperial ale!!
5167,G'Knight,3.12,too hoppy for my taste. otherwise a very solid beer for the style but not red. more of a slightly darker honey. old chub is much better! to me this tastes like the rest of the ipas in this style.
5168,G'Knight,3.95,12oz can. l: hazy red/amber colour with two fingers of off-white suds that leave rings of lacing. s: malt and some subtle cinnamon spiciness. t: red liquorice orange and caramel. unusual. alcohol heat follows as does moderate hop bitterness. f: full bodied with slick mouthfeel. o: a decent autumnal red ale that also delivers a boozy hit. not very subtle however.
5169,G'Knight,2.95,chilled 12 oz. can poured into a chilled mug. canned 08/28/21 stamped on bottom of can. consumed 11/06/21. my wife bought a single can of this randomly for me to try. it is the highest-ranked beer on this site that i have consumed to date rated #3 in the red ale - imperial style and #3096 overall at time of writing.  l: dark amber with a moderate amount of foam. a slight amount of bubbles. 3.75  s: hard to put a finger on what this smells like. smells like it will taste sour. it has notes of a typical ipa but different. 3.0  t: tastes about like it smells... kind of weird. it has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage. this is a higher abv than i am accustomed to which might account for the issues. bitterness from hops is about the only other thing i can discern. i get no sweetness at all even as the brew warmed. 2.75  f: not very easy or enjoyable to drink. 3.0  o: not for me. 3.0
5170,G'Knight,3.92,yet another great oskar offering! beautiful to behold with deeper colors at the top of the glass. i guess just because the top is wider? anyway a cool effect maybe just a little malty with the high alcohol content but great mouthfeel.
5171,Labatt Blue,3.43,clear yellow-gold with a short white head clinging in creamy doily lace.  a touch of banana or zucchini bread accents toasted cracker and a surprisingly grassy bitterness in the finish. theres maybe a ricey wax to it but less so than other aals.  not nearly as bad as i thought this would be having been ages if ever since ive had it.
5172,Labatt Blue,2.85,poured a 473ml can onto a pint glass. a one finger bubbly white head on a clear pale yellow.the head diminishes to a thin layer. you can smell the corn from about two feet away. a bit soapy initially. a bit watery. light body and carbonation. no major faults. goes down easy.
5173,Labatt Blue,3,lance storm would drink this beer if he could be serious a minute. tastes like a canadian pbr the 11.2 oz bottles always put a frown on my face. it was okay not a repurchase.  style: canadian lager | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 5% | rating: 3
5174,Labatt Blue,3.52,decent canadian adjunct lager. decent head that leaves you with some belgium lace in the end. medium gold color nose of grass like hop aroma with some sweet corn like features. taste reflective of the nose.
5175,Labatt Blue,3.58,pours a billowy white head decent retention. smells of pale malt and slight alcohol. refreshing lager that doesnt hit the wallet too hard. pretty good for what it is.
5176,Labatt Blue,2.98,brought this beer to canadian friends’ house to watch the leafs in the playoffs. the canadian beer did the leafs no favors but we had a great time drinking canadian beer with homemade pizza!  anyway i had plenty of this beer while in grad school but not much lately. it is a decent adjunct lager that tastes pretty good and has a nice sharp finish. good for pizza and hockey games. gave it 3.25 overall for old times sake.
5177,Labatt Blue,2.5,standard canadian lager.
5178,Labatt Blue,3.37,12oz can  on the pour one finger of white head formed with clouds of carbonation. after the pour carbonation calms and head starts receding to a thin cap. standard golden straw yellow.  aroma is a touch corny with an almost lemony yeast aroma that stops just shy of the cheap beer aroma that you can get a lot of the time. comes off as super bright and dry.  taste is actually pretty good especially for a macro lager. quite different than most macro usa lagers with a much brighter flavor up front that reminds me slightly of kona blond ale. the finish has a light adjunct corn and malt flavor but it is very clean. also very light.  feel is light chuggable bright and refreshing. still a full flavor brew and short of being a light lager. quick finish in flavor but mouthfeel lingers a bit longer.  overall this is probably one of the best beers ive had in the aal category and also one that stands out the most. not the cheapest in the world but still quite affordable and that makes this a great value buy.
5179,Labatt Blue,3,not a bad time but there are better out there for the price decent taste and itll get ya where your going.
5180,Carling Black Label,3.39,l- beautiful gold body with white pillow top of one inch that sticks around. nice. s- not much nose at all. slight alcohol is all i pick up. t- some corn on the front end and dry hops on the back end. not sweet but dry which i admire in an aal. f- above average for the style. smooth easy drinking. o- far above the average for an aal lager. recommended.
5181,Carling Black Label,3.21,this is good for an aal. it tastes of corn adjunct and water but it goes down smooth. its refreshing and cheap. when i feel like drinking in session it goes perfect in between hamms or banquet. i wish i could get a straight answer on what the abv is.
5182,Carling Black Label,4.3,a hot post grass cutting day. i drank it out of the can. perfect the second one was even better. look: perfectbecause the can looks cool. smell: seriously!? taste: in the pabst realm not watery not too sweet what you were expecting the usual corn bread toasted malt b.s.? feel: like a cold 12 oz can. overall: on my way to the garage fridge for a 3rd.
5183,Carling Black Label,3.07,cheap sweet beer better than bud coors or green beer. not quite a banquet...
5184,Carling Black Label,4,i’ve always enjoyed black label even though it does not taste like beer! very easy drinking.
5185,Carling Black Label,3.58,carling black label 9/1/20  an old standby from pre-craft days. poured from the 12 oz. can into a victory donnybrook nonick.  a: clear yellow with a finger thick white head which receded to thin surface foam and slight lacing.  s: mildly sweet light malt and adjunct.  t: bright clean biscuit malt with some slightly sweet notes.  m: light side of medium ok body and some carbonation tingle.  o: always a reliable refresher long a personal favorite among mainstream lagers.
5186,Carling Black Label,5,one of my all time favorite beersgrew up drinking this stuffsmooth and great taste holds a great head...it even tastes great at room temptire and it is cheap! what more could you ask for? if you have never tried it ...you should so and you will like it..just wish i could i find it bottles though.
5187,Carling Black Label,5,sweet and refreshing... probably the only beer in the world that holds its taste at room temperature.. its very citrusy to my taste buds like five alive.  idk why maybe because i find cheese disgusting and absolutely horrible just the smell of cheese alone is enough to make me vomit.  i do try different beers from time to time and i always endup going back for black label  old and true à beers beer never disappointed always consistent flavors
5188,Carling Black Label,3.6,12 fl. oz. can served in a vintage busch bavarian beer goblet  this beer pours a brilliant pale yellow and is topped with a fleeting white head that leaves spotty lacing.  the aroma is grain with a little floral and grassy hops.  the taste follows the smell. it starts out with light grain flavor. it is balanced nicely by a touch of grassy hops flavor. the finish is a little dry and clean.  light bodied with a slick smooth mouthfeel  this is a surprisingly good lager as far as macros go. it has a little more body and a slightly dry mouthfeel making for an enjoyable drinking experience. strohs move over. you need to make room for some black label in the fridge.
5189,Carling Black Label,3.88,12 ounce can into lager glass best before 11/11/2019. pours fairly crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. aromas of lemon cracker white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of corn wood pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength taste of lemon cracker white bread dough and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of corn wood peppercorn and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. light-moderate herbal floral woody grassy peppery bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of lemon cracker white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit wood peppercorn and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and no astringent hop flavors after the finish. fairly crisp/clean finishing. very clean on lager flavors minimal fruity/yeasty notes. medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. overall this is a delicious pale adjunct lager! all around great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth crisp clean and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. very flavorful and not watery for the abv. great clean pils malt/grain showcase and great noble hop presence/balance for the style. mild on adjuncts. a really enjoyable offering and outstanding style example. one of the best aal i have had for sure.
5190,Carling Black Label,3.33,happy canada day hosers! take off eh? this is one of my favorite holidays of the year since it provides me with the impetus to a) drink canned canadian beer iso the canquest (tm); b) watch hockey (either pre-recorded games or movies like slapshot; c) watch strange brew; d) eat some beaver & e) parade nekkid in the street while waving a candian flag. 2017 was their 150th anniversary so i pulled out all of the stops using sparklers & firecrackers as accoutrements which was attention-getting to say the least. the local canstabulary was bemused & amused as they led me away but i was less-than-thrilled with the 1st & 2nd degree burns especially to my sensitive bits! needless to say i have scaled back since then.  a big thank you! to my local in-person trading partner @tone77  for providing me with a buncha beers for today\s canebration! he said that many of them will take me back to the early days of the canquest (tm) when aals were the standard & the norm. no matter! today we canebrate & inebriate! cheers to our canuck neighbors!  this beer really takes me back. it was ~ 1969 & my late-pops was a hardcore unionist working at the now-defunct alcoa plant. a strike was in the offing & so a meeting was held at my parents house to decide a course of action. my rents while not teetotalers were not big imbibers so alcohol consumption was kind of a rarity. i was ~ 4 y/o at the time & curious so when somebody offered me a sip from their can of carling black label pops nodded in assent & i partook for the first time in my life. i can only remember being astounded by the bitterness of the hops just before i dropped the can from my hands spilling it all over the carpet. uproarious laughter ensued except from pops who promptly escorted me to bed. lol.  i had o canada playing on youtube as i crack!ed open the vent to begin this momentous canebration.  this reminds me of another story. i was a plankowner aboard the uss normandy (cg-60) in 1989 & when we opened the staten island naval shipyard in late-1990 i was a fixture at rangers games @msg. it was easy - flash my active duty id pay a pittance & sit in the infamous blue seats where the action happened. beer was a given & if i got there early enough to where they were not sold out a potato knish. profanity was the native tongue up there & cocaine was openly snorted but those are tales for another time. on this night the tor maple leafs were in town necessitating the singing of both the u.s. & canadian national anthems. i know the latter in both english et français so i was singing along when i suddenly registered the voices behind me. right tune wrong words or so i thought. after the anthems were done & we were seated i donned my curious cat suit & turned to ask the guys behind me as to what had transpired. they were spanish-speaking latinos of puerto rican descent who had grown up in hells kitchen & were lifelong rangers fans. they had been to so many games that they sing the national anthems in spanish! i sat back flabbergasted.  onward! i went with a nice free-flowing glug since this was such an auspicious occansion leading to the foamy formation of two-plus fingers of fizzy foamy rocky-bone-(great) white (north) head but with only moderate retention. 8=( color was a pretty yellow-gold (srm = 4 - 5) with canadian-quality clarity & now the gelt gang of midas mammon & croesus appeared to join the canadian canebration! whotta party. nose was actually not bad when rating to style.  the adjunct that mars most if not all aals is the inclusion of corn. i have loved fritos corn chips since kindergarten when i first had them as a snack but i do not like the taste of corn in beer. it is an extender that traces its roots to illicit beer being made during prohibition when anything & everything was fair game as far as ingredients were cancerned.  yes there was a corn aspect to the nose but i have encountered far worse with some like opening a bag of the aforementioned fritos! 8=p this was on the low end of that f**ked-up spectrum. mouthfeel was medium. the taste was more innocuous than anything else. it was light in flavor to the point that adjuncts were more of an afterthought than something with which to be cancerned. i was kind of surprised at just how flavorless this seemed to me to be. my palate as a self-avowed self-described hophead seemed to have evolved to the point that aals are rendered simply ethereal. not bad just not destined for guy fieri\s flavortown. finish was crisp dry & refreshing on this hot hazy humid canada day which is just what they were shooting for. sure it\s a flawed beer but the style itself is flawed. remember rate to style & not to taste boys & girls!
5191,Carling Black Label,3.23,poured from a 16 oz. can. has a very pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of grains light sweetness. taste is of malts corn light sweetness. feels light bodied in the mouth and overall it aint bad at this price point and would probably be very refreshing most of the time but its a brutally cold february night in ontario.
5192,Red Stripe Light,1.23,drain-pour!
5193,Red Stripe Light,2.91,drank for 7 straight days in jamaica. perfect abv and feel for the setting. the resort also had miller lite (which i do not drink often). i did a side by side between the two while floating on a raft in the caribbean. the red stripe light was superior to the miller light in terms of smell taste and feel. more hop presence and a nice bready backbone. i’ll probably never drink it outside of my occasional trips to the island. by for 7 days it did me well.
5194,Red Stripe Light,2.42,$1 single from the aforementioned gas station. usually dont buy light lagers under any circumstance buttttt gotta try em all.  pours a dehydrated piss yellow with a large bone white head as expected. carbonation is heavy lacing is pretty decent at the end of the swill.  smells like your typical light lager though red stripe has also been far more corn forward in my opinion  taste follows suit. super corny with a mildy bitter lime presence for whatever reason.  feel is light and watery as youd expect but it swallows easy and luckily it has no skunk.  overall i assume this was $1 because it was old and didnt sell or perhaps others from the pack had broken. dunno but for $1 there isnt much to complain about. there are better adjunct lagers out there.
5195,Red Stripe Light,3.36,had a few everyday for six straight days wile on my honeymoon in jamaica. very light yellow color when poured. very light in the mouthfeel. very easy to drink and with the 3.6abv it was perfect to sip on all day and i will be drinking again if i make it back to jamaica.
5196,Red Stripe Light,2.11,again go for the rum...
5197,Budweiser,3,a heavily consumed beer from my youth that i haven’t retried in years. unlike most of beer advocate i actually love american adjunct lagers so don’t think i’m one of those fedora tipping anti-lager guys but it really didn’t do anything for me. extremely watery tasting i’d much rather just have a coors miller or bud’s brother busch. i do love the red can though very iconic.  style: american lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 5% | rating: 3
5198,Budweiser,1.7,remember drinking many years ago  thought id try and rate it . from notes. pours highly carbonated very light yellow. the smell is grassy malt and chemical. the taste was grassy bitter in a bad wayrough  the alcohol was clearly present and cutting through everything the only flavour that could compete being the chemical one. the mouthfeel was watery  nest to no body . overall way too fizzy  basically a soda in that respect it feels carbonated rather than brewed. the chemical is there thought and i found that really unpleasant. the bitter after taste was acrid . not for me .
5199,Budweiser,3.13,placeholder for my 1000th review.  hopefully ill return to edit this with fun and whimsical words. i need to get other reviews in first tho.  not a great aal but i drank a ton of it in my youth.  and i long ago promised a friend that if i ever reviewed 1k beers that id save bud for the occasion.
5200,Budweiser,2.55,presentation: 12 ounce poured into pint glass  look: pale golden color. decent head. pretty ordinary looking beer.  smell: strong roasted malt and grain aroma. faint hops aroma.  taste: very malty and grainy flavor. the taste is more distinct than i would have thought. slight note of hops in the aftertaste.  feel: mouthfeel is smooth but not watery.  overall: this beer is okay. nothing to write home about but still drinkable. other mass produced domestic beers are better.
5201,Budweiser,3,even with all the drama not a bad beer
5202,Budweiser,3.06,i will attempt to cut through the hype and grade on a curve (for the style). drank from a can dated 23dec23 today is july 7th 2023.  this is a pretty unremarkable beer. any special malt characteristics are blended out the grains being blended with 30% rice in the mash. there is a mild hop bitterness on the taste pretty indistinct on the smell. what smell there is is dominated by the beechwood chips added during the brewing. that part of the brew is unique and under-appreciated. heavy carbonation which is probably good in something so mild.  there is nothing awful about this brew - no off-flavors nothing intensely artificial no industrial alcohol vibe. bland and light but not so much as bud light which takes better to warming. make sure you drink these ice cold.
5203,Budweiser,1,people pound a can after yard work because water doesn’t offer enough taste…that is it’s winning quality?! so many other choices without an aftertaste like the glass wasn’t fully rinsed after being washed. i never had a good pour of this in a frosted mug or straight from the can. read other reviews quantifying why it is a “1” across the board. use this beer as the benchmark of what is 1 star and enjoy something better.
5204,Budweiser,3,wait for a ridiculously hot day. put it in the freezer. go outside and do some work. get sweaty. come in. pound the budweiser. this is where this beer shines. other than that grab some hamms pbr high life etc. they are a much better deal and have more satisfaction but hey i got a case for 3 bucks after the rebate.
5205,Budweiser,5,the beer of america!
5206,Budweiser,3.76,can dated 25jun23. bought an pack due to the large rebate deal they are running. cant recall if ive ever had a bud but if so it was decades ago.  pours a straw gold with a rapidly dissipating white head. very slight bread malt aroma that is then overtaken by toasted rice. there isnt a lot of flavor but what is there is pretty good: barely-toasted bread white cracker and a slight hop bitterness. all the flavors are clean and distinct without muddling or off flavors. light bodied with a dry finish.  rated to style this is a good beer. i dont drink aals often but this is superior to those i have had.
5207,Titan IPA,3.77,had on tap at boondocks fun center thornton  on arrival there is a very light haze in a deep gold body dome lacing forms.  aroma is more of an old school wcipa with a touch of dank edd and an almost toasty malt in the very back. not as intense as expected. slight bitter herbal hops that are almost but not quite piney.  taste follows the aroma with a decent bitterness right up front that carries an herbal dank flavor that fades slightly to a mellow pine resin and toasted malt. super clean and crisp.  the feel is super smooth due to a dryness taming the full malty body. finish is longer and is very balanced with a slight warming sensation. very good 7%+ ipa in this category.  overall this is pretty good. nothing crazy out of the ordinary but a solid wc style ipa with a reasonably unique hop profile.
5208,Titan IPA,4.11,11/20/22 12oz can from washington beer store. chilly sunday afternoon before the steelers/browns game.  look is a cloudy gold in leahs glass but clear in mine? same can.  aroma is tropical pineapple and mango. slight maltiness.  decent carbonation. sweet breadiness bordering on banana bread. slight sour undertones. nice mouthfeel. hop is present through the whole experience.  not overly powerful. brewers notes describe this well.
5209,Titan IPA,4.04,poured a slightly hazy light orange amber color with a two finger white head that dissipated slowly leaving heavy lacing. i suspect that the haziness is from being a few months past the can date.  fruity nose with pineapple and citrus.  malty flavor balanced with citrus and a piney finish.  medium body and carbonation.  overall an enjoyable aipa.
5210,Titan IPA,4.4,light amber colour pinapple smell and a bouquet of exotic fresh fruits with a bucket of ipa thrown in.
5211,Titan IPA,4.5,good stuff period. theres a lot of ipas out there to have but as a colorado boy this is good stuff great intro to the brewery. nice balance of hops and citrus. definitely one of the better ones ive had.
5212,Daisy Cutter,4.29,as mentioned all the time this beer is super dank for a pale ale. really good thin mouth feel and an easy drink. has all of the good characteristics of a pale ale and some great qualities of an ipa. well worth searching for if not in the midwest. well done.
5213,Daisy Cutter,3.76,poured from a freshness dated 16 oz. can: slightly hazy deep golden-orange with a sustained foamy white head.  the aroma is mainly tropical fruit and some faint pine.  the first sip just after pouring into the glass nearly took my head off because it was so bracingly bitter and seemed very thin-bodied. please let this one warm in the glass for a few minutes before quaffing as it will calm the bitterness and give flavors of bittersweet tropical fruit and mango as well as hints of pine. this one drinks like an ipa to me. i prefer my pales ales less bracing with a well-rounded body. im still glad i tried it.
5214,Daisy Cutter,3.92,can dated 7/6 (month-plus): pours a amber nearing copper with a near clear body and a bunch of head. lacing is a bit clumpy but pretty strong. nose seems trying to throw a little citrus into a grassy bitterness along with some grain dry toast. taste opens with a bit of a grain tea from lightly toasted malts. this doesnt last too long on a cold beer but lingers longer on a warming beer. grassy notes from the aroma grow out of this fairly steadily and into full strength at the finish. a copper note leaks in on a cold beer but isnt really noticed at all at the preferred temp. the beer is pretty dry which seems to accentuate the bitterness which turns a bit dank at the end and in the finish. this offering from half acre has more of an old school ipa vibe to it than an actual ipa of theirs i recently tried.
5215,Daisy Cutter,4.18,pint can poured into a pint glass. imagine that. canned in chicago il on 6/13/23. (that’s 25 days old. we don’t sometimes get cigar city jai alai that fresh 130 miles from the tit..) aroma of unoffensive pine and citrus zest. taste bursts low and kinda dank. a wave of malt is in the mix. nice balanced finish. mmmm. really good dry finish. mouthfeel is narrow center of the tongue. medium carbonation suits it well. overall a ‘little’ beer that delivers a satisfying six minutes worth of your time.
5216,Daisy Cutter,2.92,this was from a bar so it may have been served too cold. it has a transparent amber color with a mix of hop and malt aroma. however i dont taste much. theres a bit of watered down sweetness but thats about all she wrote. for such a highly rated beer im disappointed.
5217,Daisy Cutter,3.56,this is a review of a 16 oz can. from the bottom of the can: 030 123b 3145 14:51 n95  appearance: the body of the beer is a darker shade of amber. it has pretty good clarity with only a slight bit of haze. there is a medium-large sized head which appears mostly white with a touch of a tan hue to it. it has excellent head retention which is probably the greatest feature of the appearance. the head overall looks really good on this beer. there are a few splotches of lacing that form on the glass but not many and they are separated quite a bit.  aroma: there is a light but present aroma of pine with a touch of caramel. a bit of an orange aroma comes through as well which blends with the caramel scent. it smells nice.  taste: up front there is a candied orange peel flavor with a touch of caramel. the middle of the palate has a biscuit flavor mixed with notes of lemon and lime. it has a touch of alcohol flavor and a bit of grass near the back of the palate. some pine grass and a light bit of alcohol in the aftertaste. there is also a nice lemon and lime flavor in the aftertaste but it comes in after the other flavors fade out a bit.  mouthfeel: it has a medium perceived hop bitterness with a bit of a resinous texture to a body which feels medium-light at some points and medium at others. it is more textured and weighty than a standard pale ale. it also feels like the bitterness is stronger than average. it is still enjoyable to drink and it seems to fit this beer.  overall: the can states that this is a pale ale and doesn\t appear to list an abv. it is a nice beer that seems to drink a bit more like an ipa than a pale ale. it will definitely deliver some nice flavors like the biscuit character some pine some orange and other citruses like lemon and lime. it also is a bit grassy and comes through with alcohol character. if you are an ipa lover who is looking for something with similar characteristics in a pale ale then you will probably enjoy this.  if you enjoy a more tame and drinkable pale ale this might not be for you. i could drink it again but it wouldnt replace a standard pale ale if that was what i was looking for. this might be something i would buy if i wanted an ipa but wanted it to be lower abv.
5218,Daisy Cutter,3.83,i guess i was expecting more. it is not my favorite pale ale. poured from a 2 month old can into a sam smiths pint glass it produced a good but short lived head. there is something kind of funky about the finish but the initial taste is pretty good.
5219,Daisy Cutter,3.77,appearance: pours a pale golden color with a sticky off-white foam head.  aroma: citrus pine and caramel malts.  taste: follows the nose. citrus peel a little bit of pine and some caramel malts well balanced. some some moderate bitterness that lingers into the finish.  overall: this is a pretty solid pale ale. its simple the characteristics in both the aroma and taste are well balanced. this one kills it with the drinkability.
5220,Daisy Cutter,4.15,imperial pint (stovepipe) presumably canned on january 5th 2023 hopefully this isnt a best by but if it is please let me know.  on the pour a very nice 5 finger white sudsy head formed then over a couple minutes the bubble got bigger and the head lost 2 fingers so head retention is pretty good here. body is a clear golden yellow legit pale ale look. sudsy lacing forms.  aroma is basically a bright slightly citrusy pine forest with hints of sweet wort and caramel malts. super fresh and smells like pellet hops ive used while homebrewing. perhaps an american and noble hop mix? definitely fruity but herbal as well.  taste follows the aroma but is more bitter than a lot of neipas out there. i can see why the american pale ale style is falling by the wayside in favor of session hazies. this is essentially a full flavored session wcipa in terms of the bitterness but being called a simple pale ale is still appropriate as after the citrusy and resinous bitter hops a lightly toasted and sweet malt backbone makes itself known. i\m honestly upset ipas are taking over pale ales since the latter is basically a balanced but bitter wcipa when compared to a hazy/neipa. anyways i enjoyed this beer quite a lot. hoppy but balanced by actual detectable malts. this is what craft beer was aiming to be about 10 years ago before everyone got bored of beer flavor.  feel is full without being heavy. feels similar to a 6% abv ipa despite the lower abv. full malty body with light astringency in the medium long finish. dries out over the course of a drink.  overall i greatly appreciate the balance of malt and hops here. this is what i always imagined malt backbone meant but i\\ve always been a malthead. at the same time there is a solid resinous and grapefruit pith-y hop bitterness. caramel malt sweetness without being even an amber beer. good stuff.
5221,Wit,4.5,pours a hazy yellow with massve thick head.  smell is crisp and yeasty with notes of citrus citrus peel green apples banana candy and cloves.  taste is crisp and yeasty with a soft bitterness. notes of citrus citrus peel cloves bananas and some apples.  mouthfeel is medium and smooth with effervescent carbonation.  overall a great witbier probably the best ive had.
5222,Wit,4.24,11.2 oz bottle exp date 11/7/24 into a chalice. l: pours hazy white yellow with a fizzy head that recedes quickly to white edge foam low fine carbo no lacing. s: floral coriander candy sweetness. t: sweet wheat herbal spices coriander a hint of orange lemon apple tartness a touch of honey wild flowers. f: brisk gently fizzy & punchy lightly juicy med-light body with a fast and dry finish. has a light champagne quality about it. o: a very unique spicy taste and rather quenching and ez drinking. has a very palpable dry finish and a relaxed profile. fruity and lightly sweet it is outstanding in its style.
5223,Wit,4.22,great creamy feel well rounded with notes of banana and coriander. goes down really silky but real fullness too. very enjoyable!
5224,Wit,4.33,cloudy yellow big white head excellent retention spotty lace aromas of pasta water coriander orange herbs slight spice cream of wheat orange coriander light spice slightly tart light bodied but fluffy well carbonated not that big on wits but this is a good one
5225,Wit,4.29,lightly hazed gold (srm 5-7) with a big white fluffy head that holds 2” briefly before slowly melting over the next five minutes. delicate belgian lace coats the glass while fine columns of carbonation lazily float upwards.  the aroma has a pleasantly mild wheat backbone. modest spicy yeast dances with light coriander kicking up some dust in its wake.  wheat bread and a mild sensation of overripe banana gives way to coriander. the coriander is mild yet much more present than the aroma had suggested. the finish is faint and lingering. warmth reveals unmistakable lime flavors and generally brings significant improvements to the experience. the bitterness and sweetness are both mild and balanced.  it has a creamy full body with a soft jersey cotton texture. carbonation is modest while the alcohol is as expected. it has a dryness front to back.  this is another great summer beer which i am enjoying out back while reading and watching the deer graze. mild august days are made for beers like this one.
5226,Wit,4.26,look: straw-colored and hazy. nice two finger head.  aroma: pleasantly bready with traces of lemon.  taste: creamy wheat flavor again detecting lemon (and kind of want to add more) just a hint of good quality funk. very easy to drink.  feel: light and creamy. some fine effervescence.  outstanding exhibit of the style.
5227,Wit,4.45,poured from a 330ml bottle into a sp lambic glass. pours a foggy dull yellow with a fluffy but soapy white foam head. lots and lots of citrusy orange limes and lemons on the nose. a hint of pepper. wonderful. taste is more balanced between the orange and lemon and peppery spice with a wheat-dry finish. full mouthfeel with a high level of carbonation which is crazy that this still maintains the fullness it does. really really excellent wit bier.
5228,Wit,3.78,decent but not a fan of the style for some reason. although this is the best wit beer iv had so far.
5229,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,4.34,like a lot of lagers this style doesnt get the high numbers. im always way over rdev and could go even higher with this very enjoyable american märzen. 4th can on 4 separate days and thoroughly enjoyed them all.
5230,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,3.83,16oz can dated 8/1/23.  pours clear copper with a chill-haze and a half-inch head of white. moderate retention and lacing. biscuity malt in the nose with a hint of honey-drizzled brown bread. medium bodied with a soft but crisp mouthfeel. doughy malt on the palate with a substantial bitterness and a minerally backbone. finishes dry and bitter with a dirty penny aftertaste.
5231,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,3.99,poured from a can into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours a deep amber color with a small head of off-white foam. the head has a decent level of retention fading to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma is heavy of a caramel and bready smell with light notes of toast and dough. mixed with these smells comes notes of apple and pear as well as a touch of earth and some floral hop. taste – the taste begins with a rather clean brady and doughy flavor mixed with some caramel and toffee sweetness. at the same time there is a touch of nuttiness and a little bit of apple and pear. as the taste advances the flavors take on a touch more roastiness and graininess while the sweet and doughy flavors dwindle a tad. at the end herb and earth join in leaving one with a slightly more crisp (for a marzen) and rather clean taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel -the body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a rather moderate carbonation level bot of which suit the flavor profile rather well and both of which make for a very easy sipper. overall – a rather nice flavorful and super easy drinking marzen. quite nice!
5232,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,3.84,canned on 8/1/23  tall can. pours a welcoming and warm shad of medium honey amber medium haze. large and lasting khaki cap. leaves heavier strands of sticky lacing on the glass.  malty sniff leads to some vanilla honey and maple on the palate...pleasing o fest/marzen brew.
5233,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,4,poured into a 16 oz pint glass from a can; born on 6/15/23. pours light reddish brown with initial two fingers of head (slowly but surely recedes). tastes of sweet caramel notes and slightly burnt malt. good.
5234,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,4.08,this brew boasts an attactive orange color and a slight white head. there are sweet and toasty malt notes in the nose. its medium-bodied and low in carbonation. palate is on the sweet side with the subtlest (european?) hop notes in the finish. some hop appears in the nose as the beer warms. straightforward but good.
5235,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,4.08,canned 8/25/22  i was listening to malt couture (ddb’s podcast) 2 weeks ago and this beer was featured. everyone on the pod seemed to think it was pretty good so i made a mental note to grab it if i saw it. lo and behold i found it a few days later by total accident. let’s crack this open for the crisp fall night we’re having  pours a cloudy brownish orange with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  in the nose this kinda leans a bit more into festbier territory it gives it a nice pop. i’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt herbal hops wildflower honey cracker black pepper and light orange zest  it leans a bit sweeter in taste but it’s still very solid. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting wheat bread toasted grain floral hops pear sweet honey and light pepper. the swallow brings notes of biscuity malt wildflower honey pear skin floral hops light toast and toffee  a light medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a crisp beer with a nice sweetness. finishes dry and very refreshing  this is solid stuff. highly drinkable and not too sweet like some can be
5236,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,3.65,pours an opaque translucent brown with a small head that sticks around. slight aroma of malt. a little sour on the taste than other local marzens. little bit of maltiness and some bitterness on the end. medium body.
5237,Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,3.74,from a 16oz can dated 07/25/22. served in a willi becher pub glass.  pours a crystalline caramel-copper with two-plus fingers of rocky suds. retention is good leaving robust streaks of foamy lacing. colour-wise its sort of midway between what id expect a märzen and a festbier to look like.  nose is bready-malty and somewhat reminiscent of a caramel apple.  taste has more of a sharp earthy bite to it than what id smelled. tasting brown bread and apple caramel nuts tea and tobacco. there may be a subtle slightly sweet pine needley aftertaste that’s hard to account for but only mildly discordant and really more of a curiosity than anything else.  feel is smooth and slick somewhat full bodied relative to the style with fine tingly carbonation. a little more carbonation would have been welcome considering it’s heft.  overall a credible oktoberfestbier. a somewhat americanized take on the style - despite the claim of being ‘brewed with all german ingredients’ - but not outrageously so. it’s probably a little too thick if it were my intention to drink all four cans in one sitting. not that that’s ever really my intention. it just sort of seems to happen.
5238,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,5,lives up to the #1 wheat beer in germany claim. it\s a beautiful delicious and joy inducing beer. great from a bottle can or on tap. no complaints. 5/5.
5239,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.89,this is an opaque orangey-colored beer with a dense off-white head. the nose is spicy. the palate too is spicy complex -- and utterly delicious. fantastic!
5240,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.89,one of my favorite german beers!
5241,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.47,super hazy bronze/orange color with a beauty of a head that retreats quickly with some lacing. the smell is that of clove and bread with that strange smell that others refer to a “banana”. the flavor profile is second to none in the wheat beer category with a spice and sweet wheat taste with that clove finish. the carbonation is spot on for this beer and i understand why it’s a crown favorite. paulaner can do no wrong.
5242,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.25,draft at michael collins in barcelona
5243,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.27,poured from a 12 ounce bottle the body is a slightly hazy orange yellow. there is an initial fluffy head which quickly retreats to the glass edge. modest lacing.  nose features clove banana and honey. delightful.  taste follows nose but is toned down. less honey (malt) in the taste. the clove and bubblegum flavors are light not overdone. a wheat presence balances the flavors. finish has a trace of bitterness or spice.  good carbonation and mouthfeel. soft and easy drinking.
5244,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,3.89,a true classic that did not disappoint. is this the first time i had this beer. no but one i havent had in a while and pulled the trigger on a six pack. the spice is unmatched and the flavor profile is just when you need after a round of golf in the beating sun. this isnt something i need to have three of in a sitting but if you looking to just have a nice porch sipper this answered the bell.
5245,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.44,paulaners pride and joy. beautiful hefeweizen very sessionable. not too heavy. pours well lovely classic hefeweizen colour. nice full feel. wheaty a little spice notes of banana and cloves great bready aftertaste. faultless really. so happy that it is readily available also.
5246,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,3.83,16oz can into a tall glass. best by 7/25/23.  darker body than most hefes decent head and lacing. strong banana aroma clean wheat. nice banana taste to it quite clean. does feel a little dead likely due to it being 11 months old.
5247,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),4.58,wonderful!
5248,Abner,4.59,such a well balanced beer. hill farmstead doesnt go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here. while labeled a ne ipa is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles similar to focal banger. definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty oaty finish. partly hoppy and partly rustic abner is a expertly minimalist ipa. they do all the little things right.
5249,Abner,4.34,a really great double ipa! had a pint at the bench restaurant in stowe vt. pours a hazy orange color with a good size white head and good lacing on the glass. mostly citrus aroma but nicely balanced with hoppy goodness. mouthfeel is rich crisp and moderately bitter. an outstanding double ipa!!
5250,Abner,4.61,definitely a double. the alcohol flavor is produced more so than other hill farmstead beers. however the beer is truly a hf beer with the deep caramel hue and succinct crisp hoppiness that is so refined. amazing beer but i prefer a lower alcohol beer.
5251,Abner,4.69,6 weeks old. can to wine glass.  look: pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. floaters all over the place.  smell: piney resiny somehow woody and slightly smoky. also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears.  taste: less intense more balanced but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish.  feel: clean and full at the same time. medium carbonation. quite crushable.  overall: very complex west coast style iipa that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness. some unexpected notes (smoke gummy bears) are also in the mix but everything fits in seamlessly. i‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to heady topper and pliny the elder. great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of hill farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles.
5252,Abner,4.48,draft at armsby abbey  well damn my first hill farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on ba! i know they’re more known for their saisons but i’m very happy to try this  pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing  for the style this isn’t super juicy in the nose. i’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon lemon zest bready malt light caramel peppery hops fresh grass and grapefruit rind  it’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting lemon zest crackery malt tangerine overripe melon weedy hops and light caramel. the swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest orange juice bready malt peppery hops fresh grass and light tangerine  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. finishes mostly dry and very balanced  holy shit this is a great beer. super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. i need more
5253,Terrible,5,a delightful beer that i really enjoyed - and will get again!
5254,Terrible,4.25,dark brown pour and light brown head it presents itself beautifully in the glass. the aroma is a mix of yeast dark fruits and spices with a strong caramel and candied sugar scent. the taste follows the aroma with strong figs and dates caramel and candied sugar. the beer is full-bodied yet highly carbonated making it smooth and easy to drink. despite its high alcohol content it is well-balanced and the alcohol warmth is pleasant. the complexity of flavors and excellent mouthfeel make this a truly wonderful beer. it is a measuring stick for other quads.
5255,Terrible,4.16,poured a 341ml bottle into a chalice. a one finger fine tan head on black. excellent head retention and some thin lacing. subtle spice and esters in the nose. dark fruit. chocolate. a extremely mild hop finish. very smooth. medium body. low carbonation. an awesome quad. somewhat subdued but well worth a try.
5256,Terrible,4.19,these days i dont have much time to write reviews but still want to put up some thoughts. tons of people do in depth on look smell etc... others do nice long proce. i think i might try to do nice concise in between reviews without reiterating what others say.  didnt know this was a quad! i think the 10.5% is a nice middle line for quads (many often much higher).  a nice deep brown colour with ruby shade with a lighter washed out brown frothy head just around a finger with greath thickness and retention. floral smells sure but malty sweetness sweet bread raisin and mild spice notes on the nose.  a lovely mix of flavours somewhere between malt sweet bread and others. opens with a great wooden flavour kind of like oak but a little more mustiness to it. a big of dark chocolate but not particularly strong did note some dried fruits almost like cranberry-raisin mix. yeasty flavours but not chewy like other quads or even other tripels. spice is there but muted. slight medicinal aspects on the finish with brown sugar but not in the sweet way more like the way where the sweetness ends and the mild brown sugar flavours lie on the tongue after a minute.  good carbonation higher than expected dense tiny bubbles. smooths out over time body is medium and not too thick whatsoever. lighter bodied than youd think more carbonation than youd think as well. very unique little balance. alcohol is well hidden... when its cold. as it warms even just a little you feel it a bit more on the exhale. not overwhelming and it opens up the flavour to be a little sweeter a little bit more sweetness a little more spice and fruit like mild cinnamon and plum/raisin and rum like notes. great unique quadrupel. its not a malt bomb its not dessert like or super sweet its not super thick and theres some mild balancing bitterness here. very interesting!
5257,Terrible,4.42,poured from a bottle  appearance - grand frothy light brown head sits atop a dark pop body. when held to the light the body has a red mahogany color to it with nice clarity. head stays with the beer throughout the enjoyment of it and nice even lacing lines the glass.  aroma - citrus fruits and sweet floral. great quadruple smell.  taste - no alcohol on the tongue belgian yeast and subdued sweet fruits complex smooth and enjoyable slight malty/ brown sugary thickness lingers in the back of the throat  mouthfeel - lighter than expected mild carbonation  overall - absolutely enjoyable beer to drink. checks all the boxes in my opinion of a great quadruple.
5258,Terrible,4.2,look: it pours dark brown with a light brown colored head. it has excellent head retention.  smell: it has a strong fruity aroma up front with plums and prunes. there are some perfumy and rose like nots with very low spice.  taste: it has strong fruitness in the flavor with plums and prunes. the fruity impression makes it sweet overall. there are some caramel notes with rose like and wine like qualities.  feel: it has a medium full body with strong but pleasant alcohol warming.  overall strong alcohol and complex flavors makes this a wonderful yes strong beer.
5259,Terrible,4.51,great malty quad - fulll of flavor
5260,Terrible,3.75,750ml corked and caged - 2004 vintage best by 8-8-07. opened 2-26-22. small pop upon uncorking and pours with a thin beige head...good signs. head fades to a ring quickly. dark brown beer with good clarity at the bottom against the light. mild vinous nose of dark fruit wet wood and dusty chocolate. still a muted spicy character perceptible. some light oxidation that fades away cola flavor slick fruit light medicinal note. medium body silky mouthfeel and low carbonation. lingering heat in a sweet finish. the beer has held up well cant suggest sitting on it this long but it was a cool experience to open up an 18-year-old bottle today.
5261,Very Green,4.9,#182 great!
5262,Very Green,4.64,canned on august 21 poured on september 3.  great smell when poured. strong pineapple taste throughout the glass. great beer!
5263,Very Green,4.53,i’ve been drinking this one for years. if you haven’t had it you need some of this...stat!
5264,Very Green,4.08,appearance: pours a cloudy goldenstraw with a two finger head; strong retention and a few shards and squiggles linger  smell: tropical notes of mango pineapple and orange rind; dank and somewhat grassy  taste: tropical fruit forward with the mango and pineapple leading the impression; through the middle there is bitter orange rind; the finish is a bit green (might i say very green) with a grassy aspect  mouthfeel: meidum to full body and creamy; moderate carbonation with some hop burn  overall: decent but not among my favorites from tree house due to the hop burn in the finish; i am somewhat surprised as i have really enjoyed the other beers i have tasted in the green series
5265,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.48,thinner barleywine both in appearance and in mouthfeel. hops are noticeable on the nose. lots of barrel in the profile with a lovely bourbon barrel aged maple syrup character. great under the radar barrel aged barleywine.
5266,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.5,2019 version poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a morning delight tulip glass. toffee aroma. taste is sweet malts molasses barrel. smooth sweet and boozy.
5267,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.26,bottle from bottle barn. mahogany pour fluffy head fades to tiny ring. woody toffee aroma hint of booziness to come. taste is sweet malts molasses barrel notes. smooth sweet and boozy. wonderful.
5268,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.5,dark cloudy brown with lightly fuzzy hpead and lacing. smell is boozy malty dark fruit notes molasses and brown sugar. taste is boozy bourbon sweet brown sugar and molasses light dark fruit and vanilla notes. medium bodied mouth watering and yes boozy. very good.
5269,Birra Peroni,2.36,bottle to shaker pint at a fine restaurant in phx. crystal clear pale straw appearance with a minor soapy white head that sticks with medium bubbles. sweet and bready minor fruity floral characteristics highly carbonated easy drinking but not much to it.
5270,Birra Peroni,3.25,drunk at the spuzzuliamm pizzeria in napoli (italy). 067 liter bottle.  look: shows a light golden color with a small foam head and lacing left behind. smell: light bready hints and floral. taste: breaady taste. feel: light bodied well carbonated beer overall it is a good beer.
5271,Birra Peroni,5,lots of fives .. from my heart & soul & lots of fond memories. peroni red a/o rosso. the most popular beer in italy. its been maybe twenty plus years since its been available in the united states. replaced by nastro a different animal. i dream about peroni red. we eat pizza spaget ital chow all the time. red was at every italian restaurant that sold beer. it was the go to. i can see that tap or that nice looking brown bottle with the red & white label. folding a hot slice in one hand a cold peroni in the other. a beer that belonged. anise that anise taste & smell. felt so good. someone should have it for sale in the usa. help
5272,Birra Peroni,3.31,perfectly fine mass lager from italy. made in bari roma padova. i prefer this to other (moretti forst) italian lagers. bravo much better than a heinekin too! when in italy order peroni.
5273,Birra Peroni,2.75,(bottle and draught). very light golden colour moderate head. neutral pilsener flavour (yes another one!) drinkable but nastro azzurro is better.
5274,Amstel Lager,1.19,hate it. sick if it everywhere in the coast. i go away to relax and enjoy a holiday not to walk around from one bar to the next looking for something else other than this puke! dreadful taste. worse aftertaste. and whats with bars not only offering in draft they have to subject us to it in a bottle as well? no imagination! when i managed bars the trick was to offer choice to get as many customers as possible...not limit them. bad management.
5275,Amstel Lager,1.61,forgettable beer.
5276,Amstel Lager,2.58,its everywhere in curaçao and its pretty bad. i woyld prefer tha other offerings. the dutchers have pretty bad pallets and choice in beer. very low energy.
5277,Amstel Lager,4.56,crispy fresh with a certain je ne sais quoi. a very solid beer in my honest opinion which you can drink either with food or if you are having a few bevvys with the girls.
5278,Amstel Lager,2.52,from bottle and on tap on numerous occasions. an average lager. very average!............................................. once a half-decent lager for the amsterdam region later chosen as heinekens downmarket brand.
5279,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.17,i kinda wish there was more toasted coconut and less young coconut in this bad boy.
5280,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.73,look - outstanding black thick with a really nice than frothy sticky head smell - so much coconut and chocolate taste - sweet coconut and chocolate along with a ton of barrel feel - thick and creamy overall - if you like coconut this is the best there is
5281,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,5,thick gooey delicious. just tastes magnificent. great smell. amazing body. coats the mouth perfectly. one of the best ive ever had. nice and dark not boozy super sweet.
5282,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,5,i tried this beer out of a bottle is an amazing flavor of apricot and honey lots of yeast that is gathered on top amazingly high carbonation but not overblown probably the most perfect beer for summertime i could ever think of in general one of my top favorites definitely top 10
5283,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.3,gold cloudy very foamy & strong lacing.   taste and aroma of lemon pear apples grass a hint of grapefruit and a tiny bit spicy. very smooth and refreshing.  really great for a blonde ale but not as outstanding as 12 is.
5284,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.4,pours a golden blonde color with a near crystal clear transparency. head is two fingers of white foam with more build up after a light swirl of the glass. this frothy pillowy foam sits a top for a long while after the pour. there is visible sediment at the base of the bottle; however only the first 3/4 of the bottle were poured into the glass for this review. aroma is punchy grass herbal medicinal and spicy hops with a big cut of spicy yeast just behind. this yeast comes paired with clove apple cider and earthy malts. it smells light and yet thick; that is to say the breadth of notes is pretty simple but the depth to each note is huge. flavor profile driven by the same characteristics. it pits resiny herbal grassy spicy hops against earthy bready malt undertones. clove pairs with spicy yeast for a little further zest and grit. mouth feel has a sharp effervescence at least initially. effervescence bubbles down to a thin crisp texture. it has a medium thickness. overall really stellar depth here while remaining easy to drink. its on the easier drinking side of the belgium spectrum and yet still retains a remarkable depth.  served in a 15.5oz spiegelau tulip from a 33cl bottle.
5285,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.66,more yellow than copper lacing foam.  clean hops maybe salt no malt.  finishes with more than a touch of hops hardly bitter touch of honey. nothings really jumping at me.  nothing if not easy going and clean and dry.
5286,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.56,a lot of the time one simply wakes up because they are alive but not that they want to. with westy blond in the fridge though i sprung up like james brown on a line of snow.  and?  glorious. just glorious. it doesn’t hit you it caresses you like adriana lima putting on a pair of panties.  i can’t anymore because i need to get back to it.  be well. be oh so well.
5287,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.77,blind-tasted except for the beers name and brewery/country zero reviews below read (yet!)... l- pale gold it was pouring clear until some minor sediment lifted right near the end. 3cm creamy/lumpy white foam head with some sediment left in the bottle. there is unusually vigorous ongoing small-bubble rising co2 in the glass. holds well and forms lacing on the way down. s- classic belgian yeast notes lightly estery + a hint of spice. overall a bit subtle though. t- follows the smell^ but the hops are brighter and dryer than anticipated (that was my 1st sip of beer today). on swallowing the hops leave a zingy dry brush over my palate that lingers for 10+ seconds. there might also be a fruit note within it too perhaps apple. - in one respect you could feel this is like a hipstered wheat/wit/weiss beer it has most of the latter notes but the hops are notably amped up. f- as above bright refreshing one for a hot summers day. o- its very nice and elegant there is nothing that seems out of place or balance. - but apart from what i paid for it is it something seriously amazing well im not pursuaded. ive had plenty of other similar style beers to this and this isnt *that* stand-out. so ill rate it honestly based upon that. review #1900. 330ml bottle bb: not marked though it tastes fresh and i understand this one has a 12month shelf-life and the westie 8 and 12 have three years. bought from belgium.
5288,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.1,shared with a friend on june 6 2021.  it looks the part with its light amber golden and very heady pour.  the aroma is toasted bread with light belgian yeast. it is all very subtle.  the body is smooth and light to medium.  the taste was sweet toasty and bready with a vague spiciness behind it. it was quite a treat.
5289,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.92,poured the color of apple cider and was opaque enough to not see through but it seemed to block no light. the head was impressive and slow to recede never going away completely. beautiful beer. the aroma was spice forward and hinted at fruit but i couldn’t define which. i can say it smelled wonderful. the taste followed the aroma- spice would lead the way and be enveloped in the malts midway through. so enjoyable and refreshing. flat out an amazing beer thank you mark for sending this my way!
5290,Feierling Inselhopf,3.6,enjoyable may 2015 visit to feierlings beer garden in freiburg. weather was so-so but the place was doing a lively business.  the one beer available was inselhopf. it tasted to me like a fairly standard german lager a little less malty than those offered by their bavarian neighbors. they get extra credit for the beer garden experience.
5291,Feierling Inselhopf,4.28,as an englishman living in belgium it takes a lot for a german beer to excite me. most are good few are great and a few really make you want to stay all night. this beer falls into the latter category. a. creamy yellow opaque beer with a good head. s. i cant say it had a strong aroma and certainly no obvious fruity or grassy notes but i was sitting on a roof terrace in the beer garden in 32c heat surrounded by trees and the smell of the nearby restaurants wafting by! t. a complex mix of subtle fruity flavours wrapped up in a creamy texture which make it an incredibly enjoyable and very drinkable beer. the white beer must be equally as nice as my wife suggested going back again the following night!!! (as shes belgian she is no stranger to a good beer) well be going back before the end of our holliday!
5292,Feierling Inselhopf,4.84,serving: on tap at the hausbrauerei feierling biergarten in freiburg (breisgau) in 500ml krug. served: many times between march-july 2012  appearance: a hazy pale yellow. not as golden as a hefeweizen but not as pale as a pils. thick white head that sticks around for a good while. looks welcoming.  smell: fresh crisp beer-y sweet.  taste: amazing. incredible. this is one of the best beers i have ever tasted. light fruity notes on the tip and a nice kiss of hops on the back end- just enough to know theyre there but not enough to really taste them throughout the beer. incredibly well brewed. i could drink this beer for hours and continue to be enraptured by its masterful balance. truly a special beer.  mouthfeel: creamy and full-bodied. perfect carbonation for the style: enough to be frisch and effervescent but not enough to make you feel full after a few.  overall: if you are in the freiburg area you must try this beer. easily the best beer available in the entire city. if only i could get my hands on this and some rothaus back here in the states id be a happy man.
5293,Feierling Inselhopf,4.88,0.5 liter stein brought to you by a waitress.  gorgeous 1.5 inches white head.  super smooth flavor yet full bodied so it lasts enough up until your next gulp. this beer is not for sipping!  a super session beer - you just dont want to put it down.  you can easily polish off five 0.5 liter steins in 2 hours especially when you are having a great time with friends.  beware - the smoothness of the beer masks the abv. 2.5 liters of this helles easily puts you in the f$#@$# up zone. but it tastes so good that you just dont care.  tasting this beer is not enough. plan adequate time for a good session. feierling inselhopf is a must if you are in freiburg! second to feierling\s helles try the rothaus tannenzäpfle available by the bottle at most gas stations around the black forest area. these two beers are the benchmark for true german beer and the only beer the locals drink! (opinion based on 3.5 years of living in freiburg with a good pulse on the local lifestyle.)  prost!  sven
5294,Feierling Inselhopf,4.32,appearance: beautiful golden color hazy throughout. the head is thick creamy and dense and retains well.  smell: very crisp and fresh some slight fruity undertones.  taste: truly exceptional. a strong wheaty taste with some notes of citrus and flour and a slight bitter hit of hops. finishes very crisp and smooth. the texture is very full and creamy.  truly an excellent beer and certainly one of the best brewed here in freiburg.
5295,Feierling Inselhopf,4.5,amazing appearance: the head is dense fine and creamy and lasting; the body is of a nice hazy golden color. the smell is very fresh and shows some subtle fruity notes. quite enjoyable; basic but nonetheless pleasing. the taste is greatly fruity at first before a floury hoppy aftertaste appears. citrus peaches with some wheaty and cake-like nutty notes. mouthfeel is very round smooth and creamy. probably the best helles i\x92ve had so far!
5296,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,5,never drink this straight from the can! pour chilled lime-a-rita into an ice-filled glass and enjoy. makes a quick & easy not too sweet marguerita-like drink with a crisp carbonated finish. getting difficult to find similar drinks have recently disappointed: corona hard seltzer limonada and high noon sun sips hard seltzer lime were the most recent disappointments. if you know of a good lime-a-rita substitute please let me know.
5297,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.42,5/7/23 can from anthonys fridge.  look is a sickly light straw color. little to no bubbly. no head.  smell is sweet lemonade.  taste is sticky sweet. more lemonade than anything.  feels and tastes like a melted freeze pop.  how deceiving for it to be labeled bud light. this small 8 oz can had 220 calories and 29 grams of carbs! sugar bomb.
5298,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2,gut rotter
5299,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.34,pours the color of lemon-line gatorade cloudy briefest of quarter-inch heads that disappears a bit of carbonation breaking the surface no lacing. smells like margarita mix with a whiff of alcohol burn at the back. taste is thick sugary drink mix and cheap grain alcohol like something youd mix together with your friends in high school. mouthfeel is thick (sweet) but the carbonation is nice.
5300,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,1.79,if you want to puke i your mouth i’d suggest you to drink this. it’s bad.
5301,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.11,smells like a margarita but doesnt quite have the taste of one as the lime is somewhat front and center but battling with other tastes for top spot. feels slick on the tongue. the booze is mostly hidden here but youll get to taste it soon enough. i wouldnt have this again.
5302,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,3.49,color on the pour seems to be a hazy yellow with no head at all. smell is malty lime. does that make sense? like lots of lime with some really sweet white bread smells. not bad but a bit odd. taste is kind of a medicinal malty lime. again a bit odd right? mouth feel is sticky tangy sour and sweet. a lot going on here right. lots of bubbles still popping in the back of the mouth and throat after the taste. kind of fun. like pop rocks. overall this is an over priced product. i love that this is a bud light product! i do not like a lot of the bud line up starting with the signature bud let alone the crap bud light. yet this seems to laugh in the face of the bud light. artificial flavor huge abv and nowhere light in the mouth feel. i really have to rate this well for kind of kicking a lot of bud norms to the curb. and i do apologize to regular bud drinkers. carry on and cheers! drink what makes you happy! do not let some one else tell you what to drink!
5303,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,3.18,(25 oz can 19089; contains alcohol; purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)  l: cloudy jade(?)-yellow liquid; foam on pour quickly collapses to nothing persistent activity of bubbles rising  s: smells shooting out as soon as the tab was popped... smells exactly like a blend of margarita mix and malt beverage - enticing but hardly representative of my beloved malt liquor species  t: margarita mix: sweet but not sickly so... the background/base is certainly malty no doubt (and no doubt artificially enhanced with the added sugars) but its definition is obscured... rather flavorful; faint vinyl pool liner note in the back though... is that bitterness or booze struggling to break out?... a bit cloying eh?  f: its not all-out syrupy but theres definitely a concentrate or two slick-sliding though its core... for 8% the booze is buried rather well... not laborious to swill; fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence but nonetheless a tad too weighty  o: id been avoiding it but it was inevitable; a gap-filling review if there ever was one... alcopop all the way; interesting but not all that bad for what it is (ill never rid of my sweet tooth or my love of both malt beverage and lime)... i may have said it before but if slop like this is a malt liquor (and the reasons this is on ba are probably understandable if debatable) then yall gotta add my old-school jawn smirnoff ice in somewhere - fruit and field beer?? wink wink (1467)
5304,Tecate Light,2.8,pale gold in color. there’s a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering a quarter of the top in small splotchy areas. there’s a touch of soapy lacing on my glass. the aroma is of corn. i’m tasting a touch of corn and a suggestion of grassy hops. the mouth is thin and watery.
5305,Tecate Light,2.75,can pour into a pint glass. clear golden appearance with a modest soapy head that recedes quickly to a surface film and collar. celery scallion metallic notes. light body light carbonation.
5306,Tecate Light,2.58,12oz can best by september 2023 fresh  on the pour a very light straw yellow body with about 2 fingers of mixed fine and fizzy head was present that quickly became rocky and started dissipating. carbonation extremely high. head settles at a thin bubbly covering.  aroma is somewhere between the generic beer lager smell and sweet corn straight from the can. a touch of sulfur.  flavor is very sweet but much better poured in a glass than straight out of the can. there is some light dms but it seems to fade quite a bit when poured in a glass. the taste is quite sweet and corny.  feel initially implies a full corny almost syrupy flavor but a dry astringency quickly creeps in. still the finish is surprisingly long for 3.9% abv. almost too long and this beer is only really refreshing poured in a glass.  overall compared to standard tecate this is a disappointment. not nearly as good of a lager but the flavor is still full if not a bit off. for a light beer this is a bit heavy.
5307,Tecate Light,3.11,can purchased from muelle de pescadores in isla mujeres mexico.  this one pours a very light yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells like corn and grain and not much else.  this isn’t the best but sitting on the beach on a hot day with some tacos? it does ok. there’s not much to it it’s slightly grainy and slightly corny and mostly just watery.  this is very light bodied crisp mostly clean and pretty drinkable.  like a lot of mexican beers this is completely location dependent. if you’re drinking it in mexico you’re probably having a good time and you’re gonna like it no matter what.
5308,Tecate Light,2.99,had on tap. straw in color with almost no head. light on the smell malt slight sweet. slightly sweet on the flavor malt and grain. more flavorful than expected light and smooth.
5309,Tecate Light,2.67,l: pours a very pale straw yellow with a white bubbly head that dissipates quickly.  s: smells like a cheap light lager notes of corn sweet apple maybe a touch of hop.  t: a touch watery notes of corn and sweet apple a maybe a very light hop definitely tastes like a cheap light lager.  f: light and crisp very easy drinking.  o: while not great this is better than some of the light beers.
5310,Tecate Light,2,so before ordering this i was served a strong margarita and decided that i needed to slow my roll but keep drinking. enter tecate light. it pours straw yellow with a head that vanishes faster than the beer. nothing to report on the smell just typical light lager scents. taste-wise its a metal can with corn notes that tastes like strange tap water. now maybe i am being harsh but it did go down smooth as its under 4% and is practically a water. not good if youre looking for flavor and body in your beer but great after getting knocked down by a heavy marg.
5311,Tecate Light,3.34,look: clear straw gold loose white head that dissipates after a few minutes.  smell: light sulfur mineral water. not a lot going on.  taste: since they cut calories with the abv and kept more carbs it’s way more flavorful than i expected. there’s the typical corn adjunct some breadiness a little earthy hops and a crisp dry finish. it’s not outstanding but there’s no way i can call it “awful”. at 3.9% you could drink this all day long. i am pleasantly surprised. if your into micheladas this would be a great starting pointe. if you don’t know what they are mix 1/3 clamato with 2/3 beer add some tabasco if you like it spicier. i’ve also made them with the same ratio and zing zang bloody mary mix.
5312,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.13,12oz bottled 05/02/23 (4 months ago) poured into a new holland signature chalice at fridge temp 11% abv. the beer pours opaque brownish reddish amber with khaki colored head. the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. lots of lacing. the aroma is mild with hints of caramel oak and bourbon. the taste is semisweet caramel malt with subtle bourbon and barrel along with some earthy hops and moderate bitterness. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. abv is fairly well disguised with just some heat on the tongue and tummy to give it away. overall very good.
5313,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,3.79,12 fluid ounce bottle served in a perfect pint glass  this beer pours rust colored with copper highlights. it is topped with a beautiful tan head that leaves nice lacing.  i get some vanilla and caramel notes. hints of booze as it warms.  sweet flavor or caramel and vanilla. the alcohol comes through as it warms.  medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel  it reminds me of kentucky bourbon barrel ale.
5314,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,3.9,just a touch lacking in clarity for a red ale strength and barrel aging notwithstanding. strong head production with good retention and lacing. body is quite dark in color appearing closer to a brown ale in dim light but shining with an almost pinkish hue (lighter than ruby red) against bright backlight.  aroma prominently features bourbon banana toast and caramel an interesting blend from the malts barrel aging and yeast expression. cola and prune emerge but with a slightly brighter tinge than you get from stouts. theres an almost fall or winter aspect to this as though subtle spices were added although i dont suspect thats the case.  the beer cant quite deliver on that complexity on the palate although its overall similar. a touch too sweet bordering on cloying; i suspect this is partly due to the bourbon. tasting notes of brown sugar toast caramel prune pepper bourbon.  pretty easy sipper appropriate for the style and abv. theres some alcohol heat but its not overpowering. this is a beer you want to drink slow but you should want to drink an 11% abv barrel aged beer slowly.  overall not the most complex or amazing beer in the world but a worthy and enjoyable effort.
5315,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,3.4,from liquor shed in casper bottled january 23rd 2023.  it pours a clear deep amber red with a great head of foam long lasting superb lacing.  the smell is bourbon lactose sugar some woody notes.  the taste is bourbon lactose wood dark pitted fruits. alcohol hidden okay.  mouthfeel is fine a sipper not as easy to sip on as others in the general abv range. its weakest component to me is the taste. not worthy of a repurchase.
5316,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.04,12oz bottle served in a snifter. bottled on 05/02/23.  appearance: dark translucent coppery-amber with an off-white head. some strands and islands of persistent lacing which was a surprise with this high of an abv.  smell: oak a bit of vanilla some mild malt and herbal notes.  taste: malty some toffee some dark stone fruit notes some oak and a hint of vanilla. there is some booziness under all of this as well. there is a mild bitter finish....but i cant quite pull it out under all the other flavors.  mouthfeel: good thickness brisk carbonation warming dry finish.  overall / drinkability: a definite slow sipper and its an unusual mix of barrel aging and an imperial red ale just minus all the hops. i feel like the hop notes (if they were there to begin with) got muddled. this beer has aspects of an english barleywine but its not quite there nor is it an american barleywine either and its not an imperial red ale either. id classify this more an an american strong ale. its good just not quite exactly anything i can put my finger on or identify. lets go with unique.
5317,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.09,murky dark amber red body with a hint of orange off-white head. bourbon entwined with red malts drier yeast raisin black currant with minor dry earth for the nose. very warm bourbon with yeast and some gentle oak prune raisin toasted caramel and red malts. feel has sharp yeast with warm booze carry the day malts are the backbone. nice balance between the base ale and the barrel though it gets tested more as it warms up
5318,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.11,a 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass delivers a handsome brew. a two inch off-white head rises above a clear red-brown nicely laced ale the smell is pleasant but faint. notes of caramel vanilla and cane sugar rise above the bourbon. the taste is less reserved with the bourbon front and center over wheat and hops. although boozy i find the relative simplicity of the taste refreshing and appealing. there are no deep coffee chocolate hops fruit or malt notes here which are the norm in a bourbon barrel aged beer. it is clean clear red ale that has been barrel aged and i applaud this uncluttered presentation. i enjoyed crimson keep way more than expected and overall crimson keep is a keeper!
5319,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.01,first time trying this dragons milk and the first time realizing that dragons milk has become a sub-brand. anyway this is the yang to the original dragons milks yin. where the original is thick and sweet here we have something a bit astringent and sharp. both are 11% abv but crimson keep is much more dangerous. the original is thick and heavy and hard to drink in quantity while the somewhat lighter crimson keep goes down quick. im a big fan of the more bitter ethanol tinged taste of this new offering. i recommend it but be careful.  pours a cloudy copper red with a nice lacy head. the smell is quite sharp and medicinal. it has a taste that is also somewhat coppery and a sharp bite thats very nice. you definitely need to like a good red ale to appreciate this beer so if you don;t like red ale take a pass. mouth feel is much thinner than the original. which contributes to its danger. i really like this.
5320,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.52,touch of sweetness from the barrel aging robust and delicious. light vanilla and brown sugar touch of molasses. all the best flavors from the barrel come through in a sublime way. tastes a little like boulevard’s bba quad - and that is a huge complement. wonder if they served this at the red wedding?
5321,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4,bottled on: 3-20-23  a - crimson garnet dark amber colored pour with thin cream colored foam and light carbonation.  s - sweet toasted caramel malt some vanille and bourbon whiskey dominate the nose.  t - sweet toasted caramel vanilla some oak and bourbon from start to finish while ending on the sweeter side with lingering bourbon caramel and vanilla.  m - big medium body with gentle carbonation and warming on the way down the throat.  o - this is a really nice sweet sipper.
5322,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.3,another in their dragons milk series a great malty barrel aged red ale very smooth could be dangerous with the high 11 %
5323,Sharp's,1.17,water with color. barely any aroma or flavors
5324,Sharp's,2.25,from notes: looks like miller. smells like miller. tastes like miller with water chaser. then another water to wash it down. feels too light to count as beer. overall i dont know. this isnt my thing.
5325,Sharp's,1.5,i didnt think i would have anything good to say about odouls but its a damn site better than this. even for a low alcohol brew this is just not good. i really do not like the taste and cant get past that
5326,Sharp's,3,bottle ran me $0.99.  medium-bodied but lacking in flavour. amber malt 6 row/pale malt malt extract.  certainly drinkable. it has a nice albeit shallow flavour. a dependable nonalcoholic beer but not something anyone would likely crave. probably better than odouls but do we really care?  high c / average
5327,Sharp's,2.23,12 oz. can:  pours clear pale straw yellow with a decent white head and lacing for the style.  the smell is of... well what little smell there is is of... not much. maybe some grain or adjunct (corn?). clean.  the taste is of... not much. there is something that hints towards grain. an odd chemical-ish something in the very brief finish.  watery and not terribly fizzy. crisp as tonic water.  there are much better na brews out there. this has virtually nothing to it except water and some bubbles.  i had this on a clean palate and i am not congested. this is too mild even for a macro na adjunct lager.
5328,Sharp's,1.38,look: murky yellow with a lot of carbonation. feel: fizzy malty and light. taste: sweet and malty a bit like pear cider. tastes like flat beer. smell: apple juice and malted corn.
5329,Sharp's,2.68,pours a yellow color with a lot of carbonation and a nice head. the smell is of grains mostly corn and the taste is the same. mouthful is watery but ok overall it is ok to drink just a bit to watered down for me.
5330,Sharp's,3.93,good beer taste for non alcohol beer of course im not real picky on taste as much as i am price. paid about $10 and some change for a 12 pack of cans. it gets the job done.
5331,Society & Solitude #4,4.58,had on tap at rivercrest in astoria ny. deep yellow haze really nice white leaving on the glass. citrus dank resins nose… orange peel peach. taste is huge waves of hops light orange peel bitterness cracker breadiness in the background… just delicious
5332,Society & Solitude #4,4.62,canned 8/02/22.  l: pours a hazy but not opaque deep orange-gold with a beautiful thick and sticky head. splotchy lacing.  s: orange and tangerine aroma. a little peach.  t: citrus up front beautifully transitioning to a smooth fruity middle. finishes slightly dry with just a touch of bitterness.  f: extremely smooth mouthfeel. appropriate carbonation.  o: a wonderfully flavorful beer. lots going on here but it never gets muddled or overpowering.
5333,Society & Solitude #4,4.39,that pour is a deep foggy orange with a 3 cm foam cap and an aroma of orange zest. the flavor is full with orange mango and woody hop notes. the mouthfeel is soft and the flavors persist. this is superb.
5334,Society & Solitude #4,4.44,just a banger of an ipa - very refined - very balanced; no real hint of overpowering bitterness. just a smooth clean clean flavorful hop bite that makes these far too easy to drink at 8%. which isnt a bad thing. great beer.
5335,Society & Solitude #4,4.88,i’ve been fortunate to have tried some of the best ipas. this #4 is truly refined smooth. perfect for a toast! i count myself lucky to have neighbors who care enough to bring me a can or two or 8. alas they will be moving on to greener grass. so glad to have met you all.
5336,Kellerweis,3.87,i think their label got it right on the nose our bavarian-style wheat beer is complex with flavors reminiscent of banana bread and spicy clove. this hazy-golden beer glows with suspended yeast creating a velvety texture and refreshing finish. this is one of the few beers where the label is spot on. very much so enjoy the banana bread flavor going on as well as the very smooth finish.
5337,Kellerweis,3,rerate 355 ml bottle cardinal pub & bar stavanger. i turned the bottle upside down before opening. hazy yellow colour small white head of poor retention. the aroma has notes of citrus and less pronounced notes of cloves and banana. there are also some less pleasant hints of solvent. the flavour is also citrussy with moderate notes of banana and cloves. fizzy mouthfeel.  original rating: 355 ml bottle at peter gift aarhus denmark. deep golden colour no head at all in the shiny glass probably due to the pub’s ignorant use of rinse aid / rinse agent. the aroma and flavour have some of the typical notes of a hefeweizen (banana and cloves) but this beer was far from the best h.w. i’ve had (and i love hefeweizens). fizzy mouthfeel.
5338,Kellerweis,4.58,very good american hefeweisse.
5339,Kellerweis,4.08,as white beers go this is a good one. a summertime treat with diverse flavor notes a great showing by sierra nevada who is more known for their ipas
5340,Kellerweis,4.47,on tap at beer mule. l: hazy golden. creamy head s: bananas in a wheat field. t: banana clove. wheat bread.bubblegum/fruit. maybe some very mild german hops. f: fairly full and crisp. overall: so good for style. this could pretty much substitute for any sunny day easy drinking beer in the world.
5341,Celebration,4.74,this is almost perfect as an ipa being full of flavor and well rounded with a slightly more malty flavor than some but that spells delicious.
5342,Celebration,4.1,12-oz can into belgian ale glass  a - somewhat cloudy copper amber body under 4 fingers of khaki; medium/high visible carbonation; nice  s - prominent citrus and pine; malty sweetness / caramel  t - caramel sweetness up front followed closely by pine and pink grapefruit; herbal and grassy in the back end with a pleasantly dry finish  m - medium/full body moderate carbonation  o - great ipa!
5343,Celebration,3.85,accidental discovery: while busy in my workshop i mistakenly poured allagash white into a half full red solo cup of sn celebration. it was fantastic! blended together nicely and reminded me of orval (belgian trappist pale ale). so sn celebration + allagash white = orval clone? try it…
5344,Celebration,3.74,poured from a 12 ounce can into a tulip glass.  look- deep amber very hazy plentiful visible particulate medium tan frothy head above average head retention average lacing.  smell- biscuit pine faint grapefruit medium strength of scent.  taste- biscuit pine grapefruit medium strength of flavor.  feel- between medium and full body highly creamy moderately astringent high bitterness average carbonation.  overall- look was deep amber with a high amount of haziness and well above average head retention. bouquet was predominantly biscuit with some pine and citrus. taste was also dominated by malt with understated pine and grapefruit. feel was highly creamy with between medium and full body but moderate astringency. overall this west coast ipa was much too malt forward for my liking and with an abv of just 6.8% it was unnecessary.
5345,Celebration,5,this is a perfect example of an old school american ipa. i look forward to it every year and lament its passing at the end of each winter season. steeped with history its classic use of chinook cascade and centennial is unmatched bringing the bright piney citrus flavor you come to expect from the west coast.  if you like american ipas this is one you should be required by law to try. pick one up if its available! youll be so happy you did.
5346,Celebration,4.35,2/2/23 a favorite. always look forward to the holidays with celebration in the fridge. centennial & cascade hops. grapefruit pine & malt. bitterness lingers. a maltier version of torpedo.
5347,Celebration,4.29,celebration a: 3.75 - poured from 12oz can into shaker pint. poured clear with dregs at the end giving a slight haze. amber brown with tannish cream colored cap of foam. head filled the top of the glass. very nice lacing sticking to the glass throughout the session.  s: 4 - grapefruit citrus and pine. sweetness from the crystal malts is present with a caramel aroma. slight toffee to the smell too.  t: 4.5 - begins with an interplay of a candy like sweetness with herbal-orange flavor that rounds itself out with bitterness from the hop resins. mineral quality on the back end that is refreshing and announces the bitterness. finish is not overly dry. bitterness lingers - the “stickiness” from the hops is pleasant and never overwhelming.  f: 4 - medium to full bodied. carbonation was soft and pleasant.  o: 4.5 - in my mind this is the example of how crystal malts in an ipa can serve to produce a drink that is balanced with the bitterness and flavor of hops. crazy to call an ipa balanced - but sierra nevada knows a thing or two on this. the fresh hop flavor of the classic centennial and cascade varieties in this beer is unmatched.
5348,Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.04,undated can into pint glass. pours a slightly hazy amber-honey color with a brief light tan head. no lacing. initial impression is citrus pine and malt - very straightforward dipa. mouthfeel is sticky like a 12% dipa ought gto be. finish is sweet and malty. overall a very enjoyable dipa!
5349,Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.92,look - really nice thick dark auburn color with a big slight tan head and lacing smell - lots of caramel malts and piney hops taste - bitter piney slight citrus hops with a thick caramel malt backbone feel - thick body with a medium carbonation
5350,Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.39,appearance – this dirty pond brown had an appropriately moderate head.  smell – the nose is powerful and equal parts toasted malt and heavy citrus hops with light lemon. this is a big balanced dipa.  taste – the monster hops step up at the taste but the heavy malts keep them in check. a sharp pine flavor shows up at the taste.  mouthfeel – this full-bodied dipa is moderately dry. i expected a super-dry finish but the caramel from the malts keeps it pretty even. there is absolutely no alcohol sting so beware of this 12.0 abv heavy hitter.  drinkability – this is dangerously easy to chug.
5351,Double Crooked Tree IPA,4,12 oz bottle from 2015 (dont know bottle date) . poured dark amber minor head dissipated quickly with some lacing.  nose of a convoluted battle between hop malt pine caramel and ?!? teriyaki ?!?  palate of hops and hops interlocked in a battle with malts caramels and pine. semi thick mouth feel with slight sting left on the tongue. higher avb not really noticeable on the mouth but definitely warms the central nervous system after several quaffs.  this one aged rather well becoming smoother. just the teriyaki aroma on the nose i cant place my finger on and seemed a little off.  enjoyable.
5352,Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.91,holy crap this beer is kicking my ass and taking names. twelve ounce can from siciliano in grand rapids poured into a 16 oz willi glass. deep amber color topped with 2+ inches of firm white head that lasts longer than one of those my pillows you see advertised on tv. smell is a mix of pine biscuits and pure sweet alcohol. did i mention this is 12%abv? i cant remember because it kicked my ass and took my name. on the tongue this hits you with a well balanced but extremely potent mix of malt and hop bitterness (86 ibus) with tons or resinous pine a hint of grapefruit and dankety dankness to the max. although i can smell the alcohol the brew does a good job of hidi g it in the flavor profile. this is a great old fashioned true double ipa in the west coast style. i love it but cant have another tonight because it kicked my ass and took my name.
5353,Blonde Ale,2.26,date: august 12 2021... occasion: sweating out a thursday night with a new-ish gf beer... glasseware: liberty inverted pint... this sizzles while pouring out the can but its head fizzles from a white two-fingered coral that stars in its own disappearing act... its sallow golden body approximates apple juice... speaking of which the aroma is apple cracker malts sweet oats light citrus and some odd yeasts... not quite alluring... its mouthfeel is light oily refreshing enough with the finish agreeable if not fleeting... the flavor profile is soft if not repressed--apple noble hops lemon cereal oats and some funky yeasts leave this light and refreshing but not quite a fully-formed blonde... this does come with a great caveat: gluten-free makes this a possible go-to on warm summer night such as this...
5354,Blonde Ale,2.41,crystal clear light gold color. decent starting head but it fades to rim bubbles and leaves absolutely no lace. after five minutes even the rim bubbles are gone. there is however a steady stream of upward bubbles throughout the tasting.  thin and weak aroma. dry almost a apple cider-like nose.  initially i pick up on more apples. lightly sour lightly sweet. no notable hop. the body is very thin--like a macro. the carbonation is high but not like soda pop. the finish is flat and sour. short aftertaste. overall its not as bad as the rating i saw before the tasting but its not that good either.
5355,Blonde Ale,3.43,clear light gold color with small white cap.  sweetish grain aroma with a slightly floral character.  very rounded flavor of clean grain with a touch of sweetness. similar to aals without rough edges. simple grain taste with a minimum hop influence that finishes quick and clean.  medium texture with balancing carbonation.   i dont understand the low reviews on this one unless there are some production problems. my example was clean and straight forward with a pleasant if unassuming character.
5356,Blonde Ale,3.5,l: very effervescent as streams of bubbles race to the surface. it is bright gold with a thin but persistent ivory foam collar  s: aromas feature sorghum earthiness and orange peel with some hop citrus  t: it starts prickley with orange and sorghum and some earthiness. the orange peel masks some of the sharp sorghum flavors and softens it  f: medium light body and high carbonation  o: the beer is a little cidery and the sorghum earthiness comes across as a little musty especially in the aftertaste.
5357,Blonde Ale,2.4,wtf? a bottled beer from woodychandler? this is a rarity. poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head and lots of carbonation. smell is of sorghum green apples. taste is strong of sorghum cough medicine green apples yucky yuck! feels light in the mouth and overall thank god i am not gluten free.
5358,Blonde Ale,2.7,it would be interesting for those guys that drink a lot of modelo. it a session beer for the summer.
5359,Blonde Ale,2.27,12oz bottle - ok back to the sorghum and brown rice extract method of removing gluten from the beer equation - gulp.  this beer pours a clear medium golden amber colour with two fingers of puffy loosely foamy and mostly fizzy off-white head which leaves a few minor instances of sea plume lace around the glass as it quickly sinks out of sight.  it smells like apple or white wine vinegar mixed with rubbing alcohol with a heady dose of free-range berry sugar tossed right in and an acrid vegetal graininess (my old nemesis sorghum right back out of cletus back 40 again it would seem). the taste is sweet musty and kind of thin apple cider more unpleasantly vegetal maltiness some stricken earthy yeast cheap dark sugar notes and a hollow attempt at weedy and floral hop bitterness.  the carbonation is fairly light in its incessant and pandering fizziness the body on the wan side of the barest middleweight and not really all that smooth as the tart and pithy fruity nature doesnt lean that way. it finishes off-dry that stale apple cider thing still a real going concern while the other goings on are of no concern.  yup the divide between the two processes for arriving at gluten-free (or reduced i get it) beer ever widens. i cant really tell apart all the alternative grain offerings especially from this brewery as they are all pretty much a variation on what ive detailed here. oh and i just noticed that new planet is from freaking boulder colorado! how have they not yet been run out of town or at the very least um better educated?
5360,Blonde Ale,1.08,theres nothing wrong with the look of this beer but thats where the positives end. theres only six listed ingredients so i dont know what makes it taste so bad. ive tried all three of the omission beers which are gluten free just like this one and the omissions are good so it cant be the gluten free factor that makes this one so bad. its overwhelmingly citrus at first and the aftertaste is just horrid. luckily i bought this in a mixer-sixer so i didnt have to stomach more than one.
5361,Blonde Ale,2.48,i had a colleague who is gluten-free and i told her that i would keep my eye out for g-f beer options and report back to her on my findings. in the interim i retired from that job and i still have the beers awaiting review. i have not felt perfect these last couple of days so i thought that i would try something(s) fairly innocuous.  from the bottle: refreshingly smooth; gluten free; ale made from sorghum and corn extract; for every new plane beer you enjoy a portion of the proceeds is donated to help our planet.  geez louise no sooner had i begun to pop! the cap than i got a bunch of foam coming up through the neck! i placed the bottle in the awaiting glass and waited for it to calm down before proceeding. can you say gentle pour boys and girls? it acted like soda pop creating three-plus fingers of fizzy foamy bone-white head that burbled popped and fizzled its way out of existence. color was straw-yellow (srm = > 2 < 4) with ne-plus quality clarity. nose had an apple vinegar-like sharpness and i have noted this before in other g-f beers. mouthfeel was thin kind of watery. the taste had a tart apple-like flavor which while not great was drinkable. finish was semi-dry with an apple-like flavor that seemed to linger. i am not sure how i feel about this one as i have other tests to conduct. it was reasonable especially when you consider the narrow bandwidth of the gluten-free style.
5362,Blonde Ale,2.34,poured a light gold color with an airy looking white head no residual lacing. smell some hops citrus and some bread very cider like. taste and feels much like a cider with a carbonated light feel. taste is light and not much too it. definitely tastes like rubbing alcohol smells..
5363,Blonde Ale,1.15,as a long time celiac sufferer i\ve kept up a long search for a decent (good gf beer is like a white rhino) gf beer. new planet would be out of business if there were many good options. this ale  is as undrinkable as the rest of the beers produced by new planet. i\ll drink anything tolerable as there aren\t many options but this stuff tastes like you sucked on a dirty penny and then provides an aftertaste that lingers on your palate and makes the experience even worse. their other beers are horrible as well but this is the worst of the worst. do not waste your money or time with this brewery. i\d rate it a 0 overall if it was an option
5364,Blonde Ale,1,
5365,Blonde Ale,1.1,
5366,V.S.O.R.,4.85,big thanks to whomever sent this 12 oz. can to me as i continue to fantasize about every ryeway ever imagined. can dated 1/19/22.  pour is deep brown tickling black with a coke-like head that collapses just as fast. smells better than some scratch-and-sniff porn i’ve dabbled in: oak caramel & that sweet spicy rye.  v.s.o.r. is swinging for fences that it can’t even see with the naked eye. the rye is amped up to 16 – a bellowing chimera. unsure if you could cram more spicy rye into a liquid unless the glass was made of raw rye too. and my tongue. no subtle side-eye here: massive rye booze oak with some toffee & brown sugar on the finish. i could drink a four pack knowing that i wouldn’t awaken for days.  borderline perfect. revolution has done the impossible; improved on a stunning ross ryeway. wow.
5367,V.S.O.R.,4.23,this one hits well. not like thor or john henry with a hammer but more like mozart with that stick thing. i feel thunder but there is no ”boom.” and because of that it’s brilliant. like tesla in thought or freud with a cuban cigar there we are. and by that i mean here i am in liquid paradise.  play with your hamster. don’t be a bad dad.
5368,V.S.O.R.,4.7,2022 batch. dated 1/19/22 and drank on 3/19/23.  pours a very dark brown color with a finger of tan head that went away fairly quickly.  aroma is maple syrup werthers originals pecan pie caramelized brown sugar sweet brown bread fig dark cherry rye bread big toasted oak tannin big rye whiskey and bourbon spirit some vanillin. decadent yet balanced from the huge barrel character.  taste brings crème brulee sugar daddies maple and bourbon-drizzled pecan some molasses some black cherry dates some apricot rye bread and spice leather charred oak vanillin rye whiskey and bourbon spirit. exquisite balance between the sweet characteristics of the base and the rye and barrel presence. impressive.  full body which is impressive for an extended-aged beer. just enough carbonation to move the beer through the palate. slick sticky oily boozy. dries out on the finish a bit from the alcohol barrel and rye spice thankfully but this still remains a sweet and decadent beer.  the blending on this is masterful. wonderful complexity and balance. revolutions barrel program is finally getting the recognition it deserves recently. top 5 barrel program in the country imho.
5369,V.S.O.R.,4.45,canned 1/19/22  i had ryeway to heaven for the first time last summer and quite enjoyed it. then while in chicago earlier this week i was able to try boss ryeway which was even better. now i’ve reached the apex vsor. the highest rated rye beer on ba. let’s crack this big boy open and see what it has to offer  pours a mostly clear dark brown with 3 fingers of light tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the nose here is definitively closer to boss ryeway though more fruit-driven than nutty. i’m picking up on aromas of brown sugar raisin toasted oak molasses burnt caramel vanilla black cherry old leather rye whiskey and candied peanut  it’s very sweet in taste but also very balanced it’s fully rounded. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting toasted pecan fig smooth oak rye whiskey apricot brown sugar sweet caramel black cherry and toffee. the swallow brings notes of molasses toasted oak black cherry sweet whiskey raisin burnt caramel maple light vanilla and leather  a full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a slick beer. finishes a tad sticky with a boozy presence  shocking absolutely nobody this is an awesome beer. revolution consistently kills it with big beers
5370,V.S.O.R.,4.36,2023-01-05 12oz can served in a curvy fremont glass. can was filled jan 19 2022. can was treated badly though not compromised by the usps on its way here from @fbarbers house. it arrived at my house less than 30 minutes ago so its at mail truck temperature.  pours dark brown with a surprisingly large head -- maybe as much as two fingers at peak. possible its due to its mistreatment. head fades leaves a glossy black surface and a fairly tall ring around the edges. lots of active carbonation way more than i normally see in a barrel aged beer. smell is boozy barrels rye spiciness (both the grain and the spirit) a tantalizing caramel note some anise or black licorice.  taste is somewhat similar though the booziness backs off a bit (which is nice and dangerous at 15.4%). i get some more traditional barleywine notes here some dates and toffee and roasted nuts. i still get a little of the anise and i get a smoothed out rye (spirit) note that i cant quite describe -- maybe its some smooth bourbon-y-ness rounding some of the sharp corners off the rye. subsequent sips the alcohol becomes more noticeable on its own.  mouthfeel is also interesting. its fairly heavy but not super heavy prickly with all the carbonation but still has a creamy velvet feel to it. overall this is both a very good and very interesting beer. pretty unique in my experience.
5371,V.S.O.R.,4.26,ruby-tinted amber with a large airy sand-colored head that fizzes away fairly quickly leaving a churning center and large crown.  vanilla leather caramel cherry pepper and alcohol in the nose.  leather and peppery rye throughout the taste with some lovely vanilla maple and crème brûlée beneath. a touch of earthy hops and strong booze in the moderately bitter finish.  sticky syrupy feel. moderate carbonation.  really tasty. the rye pops and the bitter and leathery base goes well against the barrel sweetness.
5372,V.S.O.R.,4.52,12oz can filled jan/19/2022 l: thick & syrupy dark brown body; thin tan head disappears quickly s: boozy & sweet: spicy rye oak brown sugar caramel vanilla pepper dark fruit esters t: sweet rich boozy and extremely complex; caramel spicy & earthy rye malt rye whiskey bourbon oak vanilla maple brown sugar toffee cherry esters pecan white pepper earthy hops f: sticky & sweet full body lower carbonation sweet and boozy through and through o: definitely the sweeter version of ryeway as it says on the label; great flavor and complexity with this one - definitely a treat!
5373,V.S.O.R.,4.6,look - almost black with a nice tan bubbly head smell - boozy whisky caramel brown sugar taste - so much barrel with a ton of caramel and that rye spice outstanding feel - medium full body with a lighter carb overall - just delicious!
5374,Tank 7,4.06,8/20/23. best by 8/19/23...oops a day too late. but actually probably much more. should try to find another fresher bottle. pour is a beautiful straw yellow with a huge pillowy chalk white head. dense creamy and long lasting. good lacing. nose is lightly lemon straw citrus rind taste follows. straw subtle lemon citrus rind ester clove
5375,Tank 7,4.89,tank 7 has a thick stark-white head and a translucent bubbly gold with heavy lacing. the aroma is of horse blanket and spiced white bread. the flavor is similar with relatively-strong bitterness. tank 7 has a medium body and a dry finish.  rjt
5376,Tank 7,4.6,this is one of the few american saisons that can easily hold its own with the true belgians. just wonderful.
5377,Tank 7,4.59,tank-7 is one of my favorites whether in a bottle or draft. can drink this all year round.
5378,Tank 7,4.38,tank 7  l- 75% transparent burnt orange liquid - creamy tight light tan foam that turns spongy as it slowly settles 4.25  n- apple produce dept yeastiness allspice clove cinnamon 4.00  t – apple skin touch of mango skin clove apple grappa heat or alcohol wood barrel a touch of light herbal thymol (hops) and maybe black pepper. 4.5  f- super fine effervescence slick and smooth medium body dry lightly alcoholic finish mild heat. 4.5  o- a fine beer and a style that i like if this is close to a top representation. i appreciate no real barnyard and like the subtle flavor cues. good tang to help the malt. 4.5
5379,Tank 7,4.04,smells hoppy and is overall has a brighter fruitier hop profile compared to the hop profile of something like saison dupont. its an american take on hoppy saison and i didnt really like it that much compared with something like saison dupont. normally the citrusy or fruity flavors in a saison come from the yeast but here the hops shine brighter than the yeast. also the taste and finish are sweeter than i like despite the generous amounts of hops. its a great beer but a little too sweet and with a weird choice of hops for my personal taste. maybe if you like american style ipas and saisons but you like ipas more you would like this.
5380,Tank 7,4.24,aroma of vaguely sweet aromatics. carbonated satisfyingly spicy mouthfeel. taste of sweet florals honey fruits and a citrusy body just as described.
5381,Tank 7,4.05,hazy. high bitterness but still clean and bright. classic beer flavor reminded me of a more european style
5382,KBS,4.77,looks: beautiful tan creamy head over dark brown beer. smell: coffee bourbon alcohol just a little subdued taste: this is not subtle. sweet without being sugary. bourbon coffee chocolate and some alcohol. more balanced than something like dragon’s milk that is a little too sugary. feel: thick and just a little effervescent. overall: yum. my favorite stout i think.
5383,KBS,4.22,not much left to say. the barrel flavors are there and they’re not vaguely barrel-like. oh and it’s not a sugar bomb. the feel is what stands out the most. creamy full and slightly alcoholic at the end. fantastic.
5384,KBS,4.88,this is one of my favorite beers i have ever had. it has become my standard to compare other stouts but nothing has compared to founders so far. my only complaint is that there seems to be slight differences in taste and feel from batch to batch. however there is a good chance that its just a misperception on my part. i have always enjoyed every single one. this one is pretty pricey but its worth it 100%.
5385,KBS,4.98,really good stout rivals dragons milk which is my favorite readily available stout. dragons milk has a little bit of a sweet note that i don’t love and i didn’t detect that with kbs. i do think kbs has a stronger alcohol taste but i only noticed it on the first couple drinks. very easy to drink beer for being 12 abv.
5386,KBS,5,not for all but all must try. dark chocolate and coffee fun welcome.
5387,KBS,3.84,kbs always pours great deep dark black and smells really great if you like bourbon. the mouth feel is a medium body with that bourbon smell turning into a subtle taste. becomes more dark chocolate bitter forward as you drink it. the fresher the beer the more bite the bourbon taste has.
5388,KBS,4.64,super good but not as good as the toppling goliath ...
5389,KBS,4.35,bottled on 1.31.23  poured at fridge temp into a tulip glass.  pours jet-motor-oil-black with a rich and creamy 1.5 finger mocha colored head. 4.25  sweet and boozy bourbon vanilla and notes coming off the bottle pour in the glass gives the same. coffee peeks out as well though lightly as it warms up. bumping this up two notches because it gets richer and sweeter as it warms up. 4.75  bourbon and boozy forward fairly bitter coffee followed by some earthy chocolate and touch of hops. 4.25  very warming- slight boozy burn silky smooth with some light carbo bite. 4  overall a nice sipper that makes full and excellent use of the bourbon. aroma and taste are quite delightful and well crafted. 4.25
5390,Carta Blanca,3.3,from a quart bottle best by jan 2024. clear golden color with a thin layer of white head. straw and grainy smell with some caramel. medium body heavier than many mexican lagers. caramel and a funky corn note followed by floral and grassy bitterness. actually not bad. yes its a macro and the corn adjunct is a love-it-or-hate-it thing.
5391,Carta Blanca,3.69,on tap at la peralita in a frosted pint glass.. pours a clear yellow color with a white head . smell is grain malt and citrus . taste has pale malts lemon bread malts . mouth feel is this quenchable went well with the heat from the food.
5392,Carta Blanca,2.55,poured from 16oz can into a tumbler.  appearance: light golden hue with no haze and a ton of effervescence. head is a finger of white foam that dissipated quickly.  smell: malty and grainy with a rather a bit of adjunct character. not awful but not great either.  taste: adjuncts malt almost a little sourness. honestly it’s not wonderful.  mouthfeel: medium-light body with a reasonable carbonation. not really creamy but it’s fine.  overall: there are worse macro lagers out there but this isn’t a wonderful beer.
5393,Carta Blanca,3.03,poured from a 32oz bottle best by apr 2023  on the pour a 3 finger white head forms with some light fizziness. after a while the head dissipates to a more fizzy rocky 1 finger head. fine plentiful carbonation in a golden yellow body. for the style head retention is pretty nice.  aroma is old and almost skunky in the hops. corn is present and lager character is quite present. a very mexican import aroma. despite that it is full bodied while maintaining a lighter and refreshing presence. high carbonation while still being quite smooth and a nice dinner beer.  overall this is pretty good but there are a few off notes traditional cervesa corny flavors and a bit of that corona like skunk but a bit more rich and sweet than a lot of light mexican beers.  taste is light and cervesa like with the skunky off note gone on the palate almost entirely until there is a faint note of it on the very end. the main flavor of this is corny crackery malts with a slight sweetness. this beer is not very bitter but would be quite good on a beach with canitas tacos and lime.  feel is bigger than a lot of other pale mexican lagers. decently long finish from the malt and somewhat full bodied while maintaining
5394,Carta Blanca,2.14,i had this beer with some pasole at gabriel’s near santa fe. poured from a bottle into a tall half pint glass. clear yellow color with a good white head with decent lacing. faint hint of corn in the smell and taste. a bit of citrus. not much taste overall. just thought i would give it a try.
5395,Carta Blanca,2,i have to admit it went down nicely on a hot baja afternoon but really nothing but a refresher.
5396,Carta Blanca,4.1,dont know if its just me but this tastes worse every time i have it! far from the worst beer from the gas station/bodega though lol
5397,Carta Blanca,2,this is like the miller of mexico. miller light. its definitely corny slightly sweet much lighter than you would expect. i mean thats all there is to say. without the import markup it would be right next to the cans of light and ice beer we know and love. its fun to explore new stuff that rolls in to the gas station but if its rollin in there i really shoulda known better
5398,Carta Blanca,5,8 oit of 10 stars. does anybody like don chelada cups!?!?!?ñ?!?!? they are the best combo ever in the world!! i was ptainet (patient)(& lord and behold) it was the best thing i drink and the only vice i wish i had... lol j.k. i\m chicano & love this cèrveza with the deepest depths of my heart to be honest!
5399,Carta Blanca,4.08,i drink so many different beers. i love all of the craft beers more than anything but this is a go to. it has a before and aftertaste of candy to me.
5400,Munsterfest,3.82,pours a clear copper color with a nice head and lacing aroma has bready and malt hints taste has bready and malt flavors a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent marzen
5401,Munsterfest,4.15,bottle; no visible date. sam adams pint.  a: pours a quite dark crystal-clear copper-orange/amber. one finger white head recedes to a splotchy thin skim of foam. little visible carbonation. heard dissipated faster than i’d like.  s: (recovering from a cold) and straight from the fridge): get a little cherry tootsie pop malt sweetness with that dried fruitiness mixed in. very much like the sweeter marzens and barleywines i’ve had. toasty rich malt as it warms. right to style for a marzen i think.  t: interestingly the malt complexity and fruitiness are there on the palate but the sweetness isn’t. somehow manages to have a rich complex toasty malty flavor without being too sweet. toward the end the combination of malt fruit and noble hops makes it seem cloying but it really isn’t. this is an enigmatic marzen in being sweet without sweetness. finishes quite clean. goes right up to the line of being cloying without crossing it.  m: heavier side of medium finish is not entirely clean; a little slick. very low carbonation. could be a touch cleaner but superb.  o: my favorite marzen/festbier straddle the line between the old-fashioned and modern styles. this is clearly in the old-fashioned marzen category but is almost perfectly executed. the head fell fast and it says a touch under-carbonated (in my opinion). my only qualms with this beer that would stop me from buying more are the things i dislike about the style. 3f did a great job even though i wouldn’t buy this again. i tend to grade hardest on the styles i like the most and i like this style so take that for what it is.
5402,Munsterfest,3.61,pours clear amber-orange into my guinness glass. thick head that settles to 1/4 inch.  smells like shampoo. sorry but it does.  tastes well balanced. definitely hop-forward but not overpowering and none of that irritating citrusy hops. more like a dirt hops in a good way. malty follows in the end. hoppier than i like but that’s preference not complaint.  feels good. a little sharp bite on the swallow. the carbonation seems to happen on the aftertaste.  overall: not my fave märzen. too hop-heavy for my taste. well done for what they were probably aiming for.
5403,Munsterfest,3.5,its a solid enough offering but im not super impressed the bready flavor is a tad muted for me and it also comes off a bit... stale. idk. id definitely revisit this beer but its not what id prefer.
5404,Munsterfest,4,l - very deep orange-amber with a finger and a half of oatmeal colored head that sustains enough to leave nice lacing. s - toasted grains are the dominant aroma. excellent restraint with just a little noble hop earthiness. taste consistent with the nose and true to the style. f - medium heavy like al dente pasta.- continuing the classicalness. o - pays homage to the style. sometimes it is ok to not be not normal.
5405,Munsterfest,3.79,12oz bottle. no dating information found. clear medium amber colored body. two fingers of putty colored head and this lasts into the session with a high ring. leaves behind broken strings of lacing. aroma is dark bread malty and floral hops. taste is sweet and malty. dark and sour bread. ends with some floral and fruity flavors of fig pear and apple. smooth and silky mouth feel. some crispness in the finish. lower carbonation. really quiet in the mouth but pretty in appearance.
5406,Munsterfest,4.65,bottled 7-18-23  give me more tasty german malts fff  lower carb is different for me as other describe  kinda raw tasting  wish i could find it on draft in cleveland....
5407,Munsterfest,3.83,12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single for $1.99. bottled 07-21-22 is etched on the glass so that makes this beer just over 4 months old.  look: pours an almost clear light to medium copper color. initially there was a decent khaki-colored head but it reduced to just a ring around the rim of the glass and a very thin glacier atop the surface. the beer appeared to be perfectly clear until pouring the last few ounces. after pouring the entire bottle into the glass this beer has a mild soft haze to it.  smell: malt-forward with notes of spice apple orchards caramel and toffee. it has a nice rustic bready aroma. peppery notes also.  taste: it is balanced and pretty drinkable. up front it has nice bread crust flavors along with some caramel and apple flavors. the finish is very crisp and has a spicy bite to it with a touch of bitterness. the finish especially reminds me of apple-cinnamon and ginger herbal tea almost. if this didnt have all of the spicy notes on the finish this would remind me of a jw lees harvest ale. its good just tastes like its missing something though.  feel: the body on this beer is a bit thin in my opinion for being a marzen and 6.2% abv. it also feels like it is slightly under-carbonated.  overall: im pretty sure that this is my first lager from 3 floyds. its a solid marzen offering from an american brewery. i have had better and i have had worse. granted i am reviewing this beer at 4 months old; however i dont think that it has suffered much due to age. i would try this again but probably only as a single.
5408,Munsterfest,4.35,i normally think 3 floyds beers are a bit too hoppy for me (though i do end up enjoying them). my preferred taste tends towards malty beers and i was pleasantly surprised to find that here in this marzen by them.  i love the mothfeel (very low carbonation) the beautiful orange color and the drinkable maltiness of this refreshing beer. so glad i tried it on tap. the bartender made me try it first because everyone was hating it! for shame! i loved it.
5409,Brown Shugga',4.08,rich with enough bite to be interesting
5410,Brown Shugga',3.58,local beer store had this as a single and i took a chance. first of all i couldnt find any dates or date codes anywhere on the bottle.  poured cloudy brownish color with a tan head. the smell is sweet and almost of a maple syrup. the flavor is sweet and has a warmth boozie feel. a decent beer if you like sweetness in your beers. not my kind of beer but hey it was a one off shot.
5411,Brown Shugga',4,pours a hazy amber. thick foam. malty aroma. big flavors. bitter hop body followed my syrupy malt sweetness. light brown sugar finish. you can taste the alcohol. complex but well balanced. an excellent strong ale.
5412,Brown Shugga',3.25,12oz bottle  one of my old favorites this is a big boozy sugary drink with a decent scent and look and dangerous drinkability. i used to get sixers of this for $8 back in college and many a blurry night were spent in its embrace
5413,Iris,4.4,i love the color of this beer. the carbonation is absolutely perfect and head remains after a vigorous pour. i get more funk on the nose than on the pallet. i wish it had more to taste. on the pallet it’s complex but i’ve had other beers with more. overall a great beer and worth getting again if i can get it at a good price. i would love to age this and see how it changes.
5414,Iris,4.33,appearance - the beer poured a hazy shade of amber his a huge bubbly white head. this beer could not wait to get out of the bottle!  smell - the nose was like a rustic dry sour presence with a definite green apple presence.  taste - the profile was pleasantly earthy. it initially had a floral quality that brought to mind herbal tea. also included were notes of oak lime and green apples. the sour notes were steady not screaming for attention or melting dental fixtures. the beer had a nice dry finish.  mouthfeel - after the head finished rising the carbonation was only moderately intense.  overall - this was a solid lambic though not necessarily one i would seek again.
5415,Iris,4.33,2021 bottling. medium amber in the glass with some haziness and a finger of dense off-white head that retains fairly well and leaves minimal lacing. the maltiness here is quite unique indeed almost like a flanders red -- getting some toastiness and cherry pie notes in the aromas and flavors. moderately acetic with a fluffy and lively effervescence. the hops impart a lightly bitter herbal flavor but its not too overwhelming and compliments the oaky barrel character. happy new year!  87/100
5416,Iris,4.32,750ml bottle into a teku bottled: 25 feb 2019  pours translucent with the slightest degree of haze. golden copper in color with 2 fingers width of off white colored head. aroma is very floral grassy fields some nondescript fruity esters and pungent cheese like funk. tart citrus acidity rounds out the aromas. very complex nose. taste is somewhat tart upfront but not nearly to the degree of most cantillons i’ve had and it’s also notably more funky with barnyard and pungeant cheese like funk. prominent bitterness on the finish. there is a fairly prominent sweetness to balance. mouthfeel is vibrant with high carbonation and excellent drinkability. overal far from my favorite cantillon but a complex and exceptionally well done beer.  4.5/4.25/4.25/5/4.25
5417,Iris,4.34,750 ml corked and capped green bottle vintage 2007 courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 6%. deep golden to orange colour moderate off-white head. beguiling complex aroma notes of farmhouse rustic kitchen oxidised apples apple cider vinegar and hops. the flavour is sour but not extreme hints of oxidised apples and spices unlike other lambics it also has a distinct hoppy bite in the finish.
5418,Framboise Du Fermier,4.23,this is another lactic sp sour that slaps you right in the face! thankfully it’s also full of raspberry dopeness and i can get behind that part fosho
5419,Framboise Du Fermier,4.33,interesting plum-hued body with a bit of haze and a sudsy off-white head produced with moderate pour. overripe raspberry billows out of the glass with additional aromatics of fruit leather champagne and wildflowers. very lovely although not particularly complex. flavors lean tart as per usual with sp although the intense raspberry really helps balance things out here. kinda like eating a raspberry with a lot of seeds resulting in a more tart tannic character. feel is light astringent and puckering. overall pretty decent reminds me of drie fonteinens framboos (and at a similar price point $50/750ml)  87/100
5420,Framboise Du Fermier,4.45,750 ml bottle poured into a new glarus glass at ~40 degrees f.  l: pours a clear bright ruby-garnet red at least for the first pour. forms a thin fizzy short-lived white head that swiftly dies to a ring.  s: the nose is all tart raspberries with some soft oak tannins wafting in the backdrop.  t: sharp tart sour raspberries with just a slight tang beneath of oak.  f: light and not terribly lively.  o: definitely framboise to the core with a du fermier acidity.
5421,Framboise Du Fermier,4.53,look - just beautiful! bright purplish red fairly clear till you pour the bottem of the bottle in the glass. great white head and lacing smell - tart raspberry lots of barrel and tart with some earthy notes taste - tart raspberry slight sweet but dry with a great oak feel - medium full body with a medium fizz carb slight cream overall - just fantastic and super tartness with a ton of raspberry
5422,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.38,this is pretty rough stuff one of the outwardly cheaper tasting beers in this style space heck of a lousy aftertaste but with some value when absolutely ice cold and i mean near freezing on a hot day if you can keep the clear glass out of the sun a few quick glugs can really wet the whistle but deeper analysis reveals only critique for me. average looking yellow brew high shine fizzy at first but not keeping it. the nose is metallic adjuncty all the way corny sweet to me a little floral but but really specifically from hops it doesnt seem some light struck character too and not a clean or crisp lager yeast profile its unresolved. the flavor agrees and while the first half isnt bad some pils type malt at first the second half falls apart detergent paper pennies confectionary sugar cream corn. i want to like this and even try a couple of bottles to make sure but i cant get there and the bottom pull or three from each is offensive cheap tasting as they come no lager crispness at all and even with good carbonation this feels off to me oddly sharp at temperature too stays on the palate too long and is just not a very good beer. worse than the original by a considerable margin...
5423,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.91,12oz bottle into a 12oz glass. l: pours crystal clear white straw yellow w/a soapy 1/2 white head that goes to edge foam. lightly bubbly carbonation & very little if any lacing. s: corn red apple rind sweet malt adjuncts. t: corn red apple light white bread light honey adjuncts gentle malts very light caramel a suggestion of ripe fruit. f: crisp & bright extremely clean light bodied mouth feel w/a fairly fast semi-drying finish. o: exactly what its labeled as: a light lager. very quaffable and bright tasting. it is good in its style.
5424,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.88,on tap at minnesotas oldest bar the rathskeller in new ulm. good beer definitely lighter than its full blooded big brother. would definitely have again.
5425,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.29,l-light straw color  s-faint grainy notes.  t-very lightly flavored even for a light beer. lacks the malt characteristics of several other american adjunct light beers. i had a coors light right after this and the coors light had a much bigger malt flavor (never imagined id be touting coors light strong malt notes).  f-very watery and thin.  o-i love all things schell except for this. was hoping for some resemblance to regular premo but not finding any similarities..not bad or cheap tasting just not much to taste. i have no knowledge of the history of this beer and when it was introduced and if this is even the same recipe but whatever the case this lacks flavor...any flavor...my guess is it may have come out when minnesota brewing had the label and probably not a lot went into developing it. like i said not sure if it is the same recipe but it could use a revisit by the experts at schells.  actually tastes and drinks similar to miller 64 or mich ultra.  as always scores are per style.
5426,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.55,appearance: extremely pale yellow ok head.  smell: more aroma than many light beers mild sweetness and fruitiness are detected.  taste: the smell carries over into the taste mild fruitiness and sweetness. definitely tastes like a lighter version of regular grain belt. much lighter in feel than premo.  overall: i wanted to try gb premo light so i bought a 12 pack. im not a big fan of premo this light version is slightly preferable in my book. not offensive easy to drink has a little bit of flavor--hits the mark for a light beer.
5427,Grain Belt Premium Light,2.75,grain belt premium light has a thin white head a clear fairly bubbly straw appearance and minimal lacing left behind. the aroma is of sweet mild malt and the flavor is the same with almost no bitterness. mouthfeel is light and watery and premium light finishes crisp and refreshing.  rjt
5428,Grain Belt Premium Light,1.55,can drink all day and feel nothing
5429,Underground Mountain Brown,4.13,12 oz bottle bottled on date: 08.08.2019 consumed on: 30 apr 2023 glass: snifter abv: 11.9% serving temp: room temp   look: opaque black with a 2+ finger creamy dark khaki head. the head slowly dissipates to 1 finger high and then to a thick ring and thin cover. lacing is excellent.  smell: coffee with some bittersweet chocolate. also brown sugar and vanilla. more than a touch of bourbon.  taste: sweetened coffee with a hint of cream starts the sip off. these are joined by notes of anise/black licorice fairly quickly. some char then shows up and the coffee becomes more prominent. bourbon notes underlie the entire sip. the sip finishes a bit boozy with coffee and bittersweet chocolate. there is also a slight sting at the end and some warmth from the alcohol.  feel: smooth and mouth-coating. very noticeable warmth and a sting from the alcohol. the body is medium-light.  overall: a quite tasty and complex brew. it is a nice companion to a rainy slightly chilly spring evening. the beer has held up quite well over for being 3.75 years old. the coffee has (if i recall fresh samples correctly) faded during that time but it is still very present.
5430,Underground Mountain Brown,4.35,bottled on 7.29.19  poured into the ol weizen glass at fridge temp.  onto this however; pours a deep dark hickory with a fairly impressive head that left some consistent and sticky lacing and settled into a 1/4 finger ring. 4.25  strong brown sugarmedium roast-esque coffee and robust chocolate. hints of bourbon-like vanilla and caramel. sweet but not at all overwhelming and im really digging it. 4.25  at fridge temp i get medium coffee again some lighter chocolate and just a bit of bourbon vanilla and caramel. warmed up the coffee almost fades away to leave behind the bourbon and some more noticeable booze. 4.25  body is surprisingly drinkable and a tad heavier than light and lighter than moderate. very drinkable for a higher abv which again is a win in my book. hint of booze but not lingering. warming for just a minute or so before fading. 4.75 damn i wanna give this a 5 really bad i enjoyed it that much.  overall definitely the most approachable and not overwhelming bigger beer ive consumed to date. flavors were dynamic and brilliant in a way i dont usually see in the style. this took them all and perfectly balanced them. 4.5
5431,Underground Mountain Brown,4.54,best before july 18 2020. im not ok with that! absolutely perfect beer 3 years later.  the beer pours deep brown - mahogony colored beer with a beige head. a lot of lacing on the glass that stays forever!  nose: caramel oak bourbon barrels hazelnut vanilla almond roasted malt and coffee. taste: barrels vanilla oak hazelnut coffee caramel malt roasted malt notes bourbon cinnamon chocolate and toffee. mouth: full body. low ans smooth carbonation. dry and sweet. light bitter ending.  absolutely amazing! love this beer!
5432,Underground Mountain Brown,4.5,pours a dark brown with a tan head that poofs. nose; coffee roasted malt cocoa & vanilla. taste; the nose all comes through on the tongue wrapped in oak bourbon barrel notes. some ethanol but very well controlled for 12%. medium mouthfeel & heavy carbonation. quite an easy drinker at this abv. founders knows how to do beer!
5433,Underground Mountain Brown,3.28,2019 version poured from a 12oz. bottle into a beer can shaped glass. coffee is up front. i didnt care for this is much as id hoped.
5434,Underground Mountain Brown,4.31,2020 edition poured from bottle kept in my beer fridge for the past 2 years into a snifter. dark brown almost black with a rusty light brown thin head leaving a narrow ring of lace. the smell is sweetened coffee and bourbon vanilla oak. the flavor is very much like the smell. sweet upfront rich roasted coffee a slight alcohol burn that flashes a bit like a sip of bourbon. finishes oaky cocoa and a bit of sweetness. overall a very nice barrel aged beer that’s almost like sipping a bourbon and coffee cocktail. perfect for a rainy spring evening.
5435,Underground Mountain Brown,3.99,2019 bottled tasted in 2022. poured at fridge temp. pours a nice murky brown with light brown head. good carbonation - tiny bubbles throughout. nose is hazelnut chocolate coffee maple and a bit of pipe tobacco. the taste is fantastic. tons of dark coffee. i love sumatra coffee although im not sure what the roast level is here. i prefer a darker roast. not really picking up much bourbon. mostly dark roasted malts and coffee. dark chocolate burnt toffee some dark cherries and a leather/tobacco note. mouthfeel is medium bodied and the aftertaste is a nice mix of sweet and bitter. overall a wonderful brown ale with coffee and bourbon.
5436,Underground Mountain Brown,4.16,sadly triggered a migraine. good though.
5437,Blackout Stout,4.12,picked up a single from the blue door bottleshop in hendersonville 10-7-23 for $4.25. best by 7-15-23; consumed 2-26-23.  beer poured blackout black with a nice light tan white head.  nose has notes of heavy roasted malts and dark chocolate.  taste is a heavy roasted malt base that gives a nice dose of dark chocolate and coffee in my aspirations. finishes with a nice roasty and hoppy bitterness but it is not astringent.  mouthfeel is very nice medium to heavy bodied and very smooth.  overall a very enjoyable ris. glad to have finally tried this classic!
5438,Blackout Stout,4.05,appearance: pours a completely dark black color with a strong tan head. srm of 24. (4.00)  aroma: strong aromas of dark chocolate rich chocolate coffee cream and roast. rich and chocolate. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of rich chocolate some cany sugar gives a sweet belgian chocolate and tongue tickle in the middle before a rich and smooth chocolate finish. malty and sweet but then an uprising roasted bitterness ends up lingering. (4.00)  feel: heavier-bodied average to stronger carbonation. sweet but then also an uprising of roasted bitterness that lingers. (4.00)  compared to bells expedition stout 2/2023: pours similar lighter head. similar aromas. more bittersweet chocolate and coffee roast. less thick and heavy chocolate with complex malt flavors of bread pudding and caramel. more bitter roasted and dry.  overall: a fantastic russian imperial stout. as usual great lakes fashion this one packs together a great array of rich chocolate flavors with a rising roasted bitterness. balance is the name of the game here and it does it very nicely. 9.9% makes it feel like its lighter but make no mistake its still 10% and incredibly and dangerously drinkable. (rating: 4.05)
5439,Blackout Stout,4.3,12 ounce bottle in a fine snifter.  toasted dark brown color with a nice 1f dark tan cap. semitransparent. various light lacing.  dry barley out front. dark chocolate and roasted coffee aromas anise and liquor soaked dark fruit.  belgian dark chocolate and roasted coffee flavors. the dry barley comes along.  palate friendly smooth medium body. dark roast and a touch of hop bitterness blend together.  a good xmas eve stout pick that ends the evening nicely. all around good imperial stout that i’ll have again.
5440,Blackout Stout,4.02,12 oz bottle date: 06/11/2019 consumed on: 17 nov 2022 glass: snifter abv: 9.9% serving temp: 54.8 f   look: deep and opaque black with a thin tan head. the head dissipates to a ring and a thin film over most of the beer. lacing is good.  smell: very rich dark bittersweet chocolate with some notes of dark fruits in the background. some char (which blends into the chocolate aromas) and faint notes of espresso and black licorice. some earthy notes are in there as well.  taste: dark malts and chocolate start things off and then the dark fruits and some molasses (like blackstrap) take over for a short time. the sip really sweetens up with perhaps some brown sugar coming thru. then the earthy notes and the somewhat bitter char take over which help bring back some chocolate and also some dark roasted coffee. things finish bittersweet and roasty and somewhat dry (for an imperial stout). the alcohol is fairly well hidden though not completely.  feel: smooth and creamy with some warmth from the alcohol. the body is medium. with a slight lean towards medium-full.  overall: a very good (russian) imperial stout. not overly bitter for the style this tends towards the sweeter side but not overly much. very drinkable and perhaps dangerously so.  this beer has aged well over the 4 years that i have had it. i think that things have smoothed out over that time and blended quite nicely. what does seem to have suffered is the head/carbonation and the body (which is a tad light for my preferences for an ris). but thats ok. i never found this beer to be overly hoppy/bitter when fresh so i wasnt sure how it would handle this many years. i can say that it handled that time just fine.
5441,Blackout Stout,4.18,pours a black color with a minimal head that disappears quickly. aroma of coffee and roasted malts. taste is black coffee and roasted malts. finish is hoppy bitterness.
5442,Blackout Stout,1.79,horrible stout. smells contain malt and barley. very little coffee or chocolate. unless the bitterness is supposed to be the coffee and chocolate. very unbalanced in terms of sweetness. extremely bitter. much better stout beers out there.
5443,Blackout Stout,4.5,nicely balanced classic ris. not as bitter and hop heavy as some others made during the past decades. very much enjoyed and found this easy to drink.
5444,Blackout Stout,4.12,pours a transparent dark brown small khali head hangs around for a bit leaving some spotty lacing. nose gets lotsa roasted malt taste buds say dark fruit bitter cocoa and a slightly hoppy finish. look forward to this every year surprised ive never rated it before.
5445,Blackout Stout,4.68,12oz bottle into a pint glass.  pours a nice dark color near black with a creamy tan head that reduced to about half a finger for the duration of the drink.  smells of cherries with the faintest hint of chocolate.  tastes of cherries with a dark chocolate and coffee finish. absolutely amazing. alcohol very well hidden.  mouthfeel is crisp yet very smooth almost creamy but also almost thin - a nice balanced in-between. incredibly enjoyable.  overall a great imperial stout. that 9.9% makes this a one-and-done at most at a time in my book but it is worth it. definitely my favorite seasonal from glbc.
5446,The Dissident,4.04,2016 version. leggy white front over hazy garnet; pomegranate wine barrel cherry stone and light cheese on the nose; cherry juice cider tin vanilla winey wood and cotton candy finish; tart round sticky.  4 4.25 4 3.75 4  there’s a good oude bruin in there somewhere but it’s buried under a ton of cherry. that’s good news for anyone who can’t handle the tartness but for anyone else there’s something getting lost. (if it was a flanders red maybe i could see this much fruit…) there’s some wood and only the vaguest funk after 7 years and the wine serves to double up those cherries.  deep and fun in its own way but just too sweet.
5447,The Dissident,4.34,*2019 reserve with cherries 10.5% abv look: a fairly clear and light cherry red with a minimal head that suds up quickly and rapidly dissipates to only a ring of film encircling the beer and leaving no lacing behind aroma: i could smell it on the pour. tart pie cherries oak barrels lactic acid notes ripe dark (bing etc.) cherries wood tannins reminiscent of a cabernet sauvignon or similar red wine and wafts of some funky barnyard-like notes taste: ripe dark cherries hit the palate first as layers of woody oak quickly join in the mingle with the cherry. for a split second those notes hold before the quickly building acidity crescendos and as it does wet straw some leather and barnyard notes become evident and hold center stage until cherries reclaim the spotlight and lead to a very tart spritzy and acidic finish with zero detectable alcohol heat mouthfeel: light but full very clean throughout looks low but drinks like it’s medium to highly carbonated and wonderfully dry on the finish overall: wow this is straight up blowing my mind right now and in a very good way. my sister-in-law gifted this gem to me for my b-day and i’d only had it one other time in my life – 2008 when these folks first made it and my palate being much more developed now i can appreciate how good it is. it’s like a fine bold red wine meets tart and dark cherry juice meets orval – super complex lots of cherry and oak some funk spritzy like a champagne (though not that much so) and absolutely no way to tell that it’s 10.5% abv. phenomenal and highly recommended for any oud bruin fan out there
5448,The Dissident,4.36,this is a 2016. five full years in the cellar have worked magic with this exceptional ale. too bad i don’t have a fresh one right now to try it against - the difference is phenomenal. super smooth and mellow much less sour but a bit more funky more juicy dark fruit.
5449,The Dissident,4.04,a 1 pint 6 fl. oz. waxed bomber 2015 reserve with a best after date of 30th october 2016. poured into a holy mountain tulip glass.  appearance: a mostly clear amber brown colour with a one finger beige head that had decent retention and left some nice lacing.  aroma: tart cherry vinous light acetone oak caramel notes and a touch of vinegar.  taste: lightly sour and tart cherry red grape plum vinous oak caramel light boozy.  mouthfeel: medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  overall: abv was higher than expected although the waxed bottle probably should have hinted in that direction. there was a slight boozy feel but despite that it was still smooth enjoyable and easy to drink.
5450,The Dissident,4.13,four year old bottle.  nearly flat beer murky brownish color.  wonderful nose: moderately sour with tons of oak vinegar tannins lemon and cherry.  flavor follows although it shows the age and oxidation much more than the nose (surprising perhaps given that part of the mystique around a wax cap is that it should help prevent oxidation). flavor profile is otherwise the same as the nose along with notes of peach and leather.  unbelievably drinkable for the high abv; it drinks like a sour at 50-75% of the abv.
5451,The Dissident,4.5,22 oz bottle 2015 vintage poured into a snifter at 50 degrees f: l - brown/red with an off white head that lingered at the edges of the glass s - cherries oak t - medium funk on the nose then cherries and oak with wine tannins on the finish f - light mouthfeel with medium carbonation o - complex and interesting beer very good
5452,The Dissident,4.21,500ml bottle into a tulip. 2019 reserve.  looks interesting in the glass. deep deep hazy amber body with good carbonation replenishing a creamy foamy slightly off white head. this head persists throughout impressive given the abv. layers of lacing.  aroma of tart cherry a little wine some wood. manages to smell sour.  on tasting the sour and tart notes bounce off each other making for a pleasing blend. cherries are evident but not strong or luscious. a little apple at times. its warm but the abv seems less than advertised.  mouth between medium and full. finish is a mouth puckering tart and sour mix with a cherry presence.  overall one of the better sours ive had. sour and tart mix sits very nicely on this palate.
5453,The Dissident,4.5,pours a lightish red colour with a medium tan head and left quite a bit of lacing on my glass.  smells of cherry oak barrel some light ethanol and kind of like a sour vinegar smell.  taste follows the nose but is even better. lots of tart cherry and general dark fruit character. booziness is less pronounced. theres this nice light funk present from start to finish thats more toned down than the brett version but quite pleasant. alcohol still comes through more than id like but its not terrible. the tartness balances the sweetness and the malt character really ties everything together  mouthfeel is medium-full with lots of grippy tannins.  edit: i came back to this a year after my first taste and now that my palette has developed a bit i love this one more than ever. absolute must try! im surprised that i think this was worth the money since its on the pricier side but this is definitely going in my regular rotation.
5454,The Dissident,5,was given this as a gift for father’s day. opened it on christmas eve . it didn’t disappoint an amazing cross between wine and beer only side project approaches this .
5455,The Dissident,4.85,drink it like an expensive wine. enjoy it slowly but dont let it get warm.
5456,The Dissident,4.21,sampled in a taster glass from draft at whole foods market on december 5 2019. reminds me of goudenband.
5457,Nugget Nectar,4.48,16 oz. can freshest by 05/06/2023. poured a semi-clear copper color into a samuel smith imperial pint glass with visible carbonation and a frothy white head that lingered & left loads of lacing. earthy pine resinous overtones in aroma with hints of tangerine peach apricot tropical fruits and malty goodness. flavor follows nose with a nice malty bitter-sweet backbone for a finish. sits mid to back of palate with slight carbonation tingle on the tongue. a little part its prime but this is the last one i was saving to see if it changed with age. remember it pretty much the same; an outstanding offering from tröegs. world class indeed.
5458,Nugget Nectar,4.25,pours a light clear amber. thick foam. dank hop aroma. big sticky hop body. very dank. heavy bitter finish. thicky thick. if you like hops hops and more hops give this one a try.
5459,Nugget Nectar,4.21,dark copper colored with excellent clarity. there’s a quarter inch of densely packed beige on top. heavy soapy lacing is present. the aroma is of bready malt and piney hops. i’m tasting sweet bready malt and a flourish of pine in the back of the palate. the mouth is resinous and there’s a nice long hop burn at the end.
5460,Nugget Nectar,4.64,scored the last sixpack at local deli. the flavor profile is fantastic and love the resiny mouthfeel. wow this beer deserves a mic drop!
5461,Nugget Nectar,4.43,flavors of apricot jam peach preserve brown sugar graham crackers toffee orange zest and savory mango. malty soft and smooth with hints of tropical fruit. aroma follows the palate but with more emphasis on the orange zest. mouthfeel is crisp and highly drinkable but still relatively full bodied and rich.  easily one of the best imperial red ales on the market.
5462,Nugget Nectar,4.95,the single best food or beverage to come out of hershey pa
5463,Nugget Nectar,4.24,very good red ale!!! one of my favorites
5464,Nugget Nectar,5,outstanding! highly recommend! received as a gift going to get more!
5465,Nugget Nectar,4.26,dark copper-amber but bright and almost translucent a clear pint glass full of it reveals. there\s virtually no head to describe but that\s the philly style of serving draft beers. even without a head it\s a lovely beer. little aroma rises above the glass a little malt a little hops and no discernable alcohol. this is one of those that doesn\t offer much to the nose but gives the tongue a workout. quickly it\s learned that regardless of the word nectar in its name this isn\t some sort of overly sweetened ale. there is some sweetness provided by ample malting but this one bites. there\s just the right dose of alcohol in the mix that it amplifies the sharp hoppiness which is noteworthy. with notes of pine and citrus this is a bitterly hopped brew (a good thing) that brings so much more character than most in this style. the glass lacing is a little short. so this isn\t one for the nose and maybe not long for the eyes. it is a complex hopfest within a solid malted body.
5466,Nugget Nectar,5,rare 5 out 5. looking for balanced and if so high marks it will receive. no hop bomb but you can taste the some of the excessively dry hopped but sage quickly to a malt creamy goodness. if you\re looking for a hop slinger move on but if you\re looking for great tasting grab it whem you can. cheers!
5467,Nugget Nectar,4.19,16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $4.55. freshest by 04/28/2023....given that this was released pretty recently (january 10th) i would say that this beer is less than one month old.  look: pours a clear medium amber color with a tan-colored head that slowly dissipated to a very thin layer. looks very nice.  smell: very nice aromas of fresh hops - earthy resinous pine along with some dankness woody notes and grapefruit notes. theres a bit of caramel sweetness underneath all of that hop aroma. this beer smells a bit like a slightly stronger version of sierra nevada celebration ale.  taste: its surprisingly balanced refreshing and drinkable. up front it has a very nice maltiness with the caramel notes coming through briefly before being taken over by hops. the finish is actually not nearly as bitter as i was expecting; its relatively smooth and has a pleasant long-lingering bitterness that is not very intense. nice grapefruit rind flavors on the finish also.  feel: the mouthfeel is a bit chewy. nicely carbonated. medium plus body.  overall: this beer brings back memories. the first time i had this beer was in the mid- to late- 2000s in atlanta. someone had acquired this beer in a trade (i think) and brought it to a beer share. i was blown away by this beer. there arent many other imperial red ales out there. one that i used to consume a lot of was terrapins big hoppy monster. fast forward to living in pa: i moved here just over 10 years ago. it was probably 9 years ago when i made a feeble attempt to procure some nugget nectar. i called a beer distributor that i passed on my way to work and at that time the state laws only allowed them to sell entire cases. i wasnt able to buy/consume that much beer so i passed. hard to believe that its been over 15 years since i have had this beer! enough with story time. this beer certainly deserves its #1 ranking among imperial red ales.  from the can and website: color: straw/orange hops: nugget warrior tomahawk simcoe palisade grain: munich pilsner vienna yeast: ale  its impossible to forget your first squeeze. once a year as the newest humulus lupulus harvest arrives at tröegs we blend these super-fresh hops into an imperial amber ale. exclusively dry-hopped nugget nectar is an explosion of pine resin and mango.
5468,Old Viscosity,3.84,pours black with a nice yeasty three finger head with lingering qualities. aroma is roasted malt and coffee with a touch of chocolate. taste is immediately coffee so much so that it likely overwhelms everything else. some chocolate notes appear at the end however the overall effect is a coffee profile. this unbalance is the undoing of this brew which is otherwise tasty moderately bodied and visually appealing.
5469,Old Viscosity,4.3,i got vaccinated today figured i may as well have a brew picked a nice one too beer is black as night tan coloured head which quickly dissipates lovely aroma on this deep rich malt dark chocolate tobacco vanilla dark fruits caramel flavours much the same nice balance between dark malt flavours sweet milk chocolate and vanilla and bitter espresso oaky lightly nutty high levels of bitterness on the finish smokey malt flavours and sweet caramel flavours linger full bodied and light carbonation heavy really quite boozy lot of warming all in all very nice stuff just the beer i wanted really proper nice imperial stout
5470,Old Viscosity,4.1,a - pitch black pour with light caramel head floating on top and dense lacing.  s - deep chocolate roast char and light smoke.  t - chocolate roast and chocolate char from start to finish. ends with a nice lingering chocolate roast bitterness.  m - thick and velvety with a tad bit of thin around the edges dry on the back of the tongue with a slight chalky residue coating the mouth.  o - an easy drinking imperial stout where the alcohol pokes through somewhat at the beginning but quickly subsides.
5471,Old Viscosity,3.75,bottle. i think it’s a 2015 but the date is smudged.  tan head. lace. black color.  roasted malts bitter dark chocolate coffee caramel. not super thick but it’s a big stout. lots of oak. lots of bitterness from the chocolate and hops.
5472,Old Viscosity,4.32,1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 10.0%. black colour (dark ruby when held to the light) huge tan head. lovely aroma of moderately roasted malts mild coffee chocolate oak and leather. full and rich flavour malty predominance with much the same elements as the aroma moderate but sufficient hops in the finish. well balanced immensely pleasant to drink. warming mouthfeel but the alcohol is otherwise well hidden in the flavour.
5473,Old Viscosity,4.44,this is one of the beers that started my cellar maybe not the very first bottle but near it and not because i adored it and wanted to see how it aged indeed i had never even had it before but because i was loving port at the time and never had the occasion to break it out over the years that or i forgot and its been collecting dust ever since. ive been doing one random cellar dark beer every thursday during quarantine for my own entertainment and i feel thankful to have pulled this one yesterday. i cant find a date on the bottle but this has to be approaching ten years old its no newer than maybe seven years i do not totally recall its origin story lots has happened since then but suffice it to say it should be called ancient viscosity! i dont always love how stouts age they often taste oxidized and thin to me especially ones that spent time in oak sometimes its just better to drink them close to fresh but i was rewarded for my patience with this one that is certain and the quality and refinement overall here is additional testament to how amazing port is with quality and attention to detail its immaculate. close to jet black with a surprisingly high head mocha colored and frothy with great retention and even some lace unexpected in a beer this old and some obvious bottle conditioning has taken place this is velvet to drink. i get notes of dark chocolate black licorice and unlit cigar in the nose and taste here with subtle bready yeast character earthy spice wet hearty oak and rich molasses. just a bit of oxidation to the nose but absent from the flavor shocking for how old this is. there is a nice decadence to this with it being quite dry for the style but i do get an almost belgian dark candy sugar taste in here all very well grounded and balanced nice roast smooth as anything and really seemingly pretty bulletproof in the cellar like even after about a decade its still nowhere near the end of its delicious trajectory i almost cant believe it. i love older viscosity too but this is darn near just as good especially with all this age on it a stunning specimen!
5474,Curieux,4.25,12oz bottle thanks to ken for the bottle! l: sightly hazed golden body; foamy creamy white head s: doughy grain floral noble hops spicy yeast mild oaky bourbon t: dough pale malt oak bourbon vanilla light caramel honey spicy belgian yeast grassy/spicy/floral noble hops f: super smooth medium body alcohol is warming pleasant carbonation balanced & dry finish o: i wasn’t wowed by this the first time i had it but it truly lives up to its reputation
5475,Curieux,4.78,from a can purchased at the brewery. first time and wow. so good!!! flowery but not perfumy. light and bright on the palette like other allegash beers. complex nuanced a real journey. not overly boozy in spite of the high abv. not an everyday beer. a special event.
5476,Curieux,4.1,very deceptive very tasty...  when i see a brew is barrel-aged at 10.5% and it has a taste that hints of the booze - i found it very deceptive in a good way. the booze that i expected to taste and even smell - was basically non-existent. i find this to be well made for that fact alone. a tasty treat indeed that i would be glad to try once again.
5477,Curieux,4.34,poured from a can into a tulip glass appearance – the beer pours a clear golden color with a small white foam. the head has a fantastic level of retention fading slowly over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma is big and bold with lots of candied sugar and biscuit malt. mixed with these aromas comes a nice doughy smell mixed with lots of coriander and clove along with a bit of nutmeg. at the same time notes of yeast and some peach and lychee are there as well. for a bourbon barrel aged brew the bourbon smell is light but adds a nice accent mixing with the rest to produce a rather inviting smell. taste – the taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with some sweet grape peach and apricot flavors as well as flavors of candied sugar and yeast cake. along with these flavors comes a decent showing of coriander and clove with some lighter notes of white pepper and grain. as the taste advances the sweeter flavors get stronger with some bubblegum and cane sugar joining in. at the same time a bit of grass and hay join in and with a touch of bourbon coming on at the end one is left with a nice sweet crisp and flavorful triple like flavor to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is light for a 10.5 % abv brew with a carbonation level that is high and effervescent. for the style and the taste the feel is great and makes for a very pleasant sipper. overall – while not very heavy on the bourbon at all the brew is rather flavorful and tasty. a very nice slightly sweeter sipper and one certainly worth a try.
5478,Curieux,3.84,interesting idea to barrel age a tripel and the barrel notes are quite nice. however i find the overall flavor profile lacks many of the qualities im looking for from a solid belgian tripel in addition to being a bit too boozy for the style.
5479,Curieux,4.5,pours a gorgeous slightly unfiltered golden color with a creamy white head that yields to the body of the beer fairly quickly. beautiful tripel. the nose is crammed full of oak notes with caramel and vanilla in plentiful amounts and a bit of bourbon and pear. i am literally drooling.  that oak flavor is forward and melds well with the caramel and vanilla to provide a smooth foundation for the bourbon to provide a modest amount of booziness but it’s the pear at the back of the palate that is knocking my beer nerd socks off. so many flavors and so well balanced.  the mouthfeel is substantial and fairly crisp making for an oxymoron of a beer - a crushable 10.2% abv beer. this is exceptionally well crafted and a world class tripel that i am so glad i finally had the opportunity to enjoy.
5480,Curieux,4.5,lovely beer citrusy spicey taste. scotch and lemon peel. very fresh for a tripel
5481,Curieux,4.25,looks like a lager but dont be fooled! the nose has a noted alcohol hit and the flavor is just a touch of classic belgian maltiness with an big dose of bourbon like someone had dumped a shot in the pint! a non-funky but still distinctive beer id recommend trying.
5482,Curieux,4.25,this one has been on my list to try for a while. its a tripel aged in barrels which i guess converts it to a belgian pale ale. pours paler than expected. fizzy and quick dissipating foam. smells of cloves and typical belgian smells. but then you get the whiff of the whiskey barrel. it’s like drinking earlytimes on the rocks after all the ice has melted. and thats actually excellent. the barrel is pretty prominent especially in such a pale beer. you also get notes of vanilla and toffee(?). this is definitely a unique beer and glad i got to try it. label is okay. a bit boring and generic but also dignified. its fine.
5483,Curieux,4.25,a tavour treat. pours a golden color with a minimal head that lasts quite a while. aroma of grains and citrus fruit.. taste is sour with a hint of apples and an alcohol bite. very good brew.
5484,Triple Sunshine,4.91,12 oz. can - canned on 1/03/23 look - deep gold luscious bubbly white head good lacing left behind smell - tropical dank herbal floral taste - spicy dank hops ripe pineapple grapefruit pith feel - medium in body and carbonation hoppy resinous sticky finish overall - finally got hold of this gem on a beer haul from vermont and its just as great as i thought it would be. like sip and double the smell really pops right from the can and continues after the pour. no trouble picking up the dank tropical and herbal scent. triple kicks off with spicy dank hops followed by ripe pineapple and grapefruit pith that ends with that wonderful resinous sticky finish. this is a bold brew that lives up to the hype so there is no other choice than to pair it with sunshine of your love by cream. i’ve been waiting so long to be where i’m going in the sunshine of your love!
5485,Triple Sunshine,4.49,draft at brewery. golden pour soft white head. light fruity aroma with a hit of strength. taste is sweet fruity and warm. smooth as a babys bottom. light toffee notes orange. another wow!
5486,Triple Sunshine,4.44,canned on 11/30/21 l - pours a hazy golden with a one finger white head. nice lacing. s - tropical combination of grapefruit and orange. however nothing really overpowering. which is good. t - follows the nose a bit. juicy hops. kind of a hop “pow” at the end but no lingering aftertaste. f - medium mouth feel and fairly smooth. some carbonation. o - a really good beer. i’m glad i had it.
5487,Prima Pils,4.38,i like a pilsner with a little funk that taste of the cellar or cave and prima has a little funk. it also has a slight skunkyness which i am less enamored with. but the slight skunkyness is dissolved by the hoppy bite at the end. all in all one of the best pilsners ive had. and one of my favorite brews.
5488,Prima Pils,4.16,this is generally considered an american classic take on german pilsner and theres a darn good reason for it.  theres a wonderful hoppy bite but it carries the almost spicy neutrality of noble hops not the over the top citrus or tropical fruit of new world varietals. its hoppy and bitter but its by no means an ipl. drinks crisp and clean with a bready grainy deliver of the malt bill. fairly dry finish.  its also less complex than the best pilsners but at the same time its not exactly a low volume boutique offering. getting this kind of quality from a readily available six pack is frankly pretty impressive.
5489,Prima Pils,4.02,the second time i’ve had this so time to review. pours a golden orange with good head. smells a little funky skunky and sweet. tastes like citrus a little spicy grassy a little skunky but it’s a good skunk and a nice bitterness from the german hops. a good pilsner and a refreshing beer cheers!
5490,Prima Pils,4.22,from a tap it was delivered inside a clear pint glass. theres some pleasant white head with bright amber colored and nearly translucent liquid beneath. typical pilsner hops and malting hit the nose. like many of its style brewed in pennsylvania this is an outstanding one. with a body thats supple yet both smooth and light it carries the taste near perfectly. theres just enough bitterness to the hops as it should be. the finish carries that as it becomes dry. not much to witness when looking for glass lacing but thats not why people drink beer. it may not be the best pilsner brewed in this commonwealth but its better than most made in america.
5491,Prima Pils,4.08,best by 7/2023  appearance: pours a completely clear medium golden color with a moderate white head that laces. srm of 7. (4.00)  aroma: strong aromas of floral and lemon citrus hops some yeast with a slight belgian spices of lemon and juicyfruit. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of floral and grassy hops. bitter off the front followed by some belgian yeast and some lemon citrus. pale malts then with a smooth finish bitter finish. (4.00)  feel: medium bodied strong carnation grainy bitter and clean. (4.25)  compared to fair state pils 5/2023: pours darker milder head. stronger aromas. more yeast and belgian spices of lemon and juicyfruit. less bitter flower. dryer and cleaner.  overall: a very nice drinking german pilsner here. strong floral and bitter hops also with a strong yeast presence that gives hints of juicyfruit. dry bitter yeasty and clean. seems like it blends a german pils kellerbier with a touch of goodness from golden monkey. its complex and drinks well. (rating: 4.08)
5492,Prima Pils,4.3,on draft at trident
5493,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4,16.9oz bottled best by 9-7-24 opened 9-10-23. thin tan head with limited staying power falls to a ring and island quickly and hangs there. opaque body at the core with dark brown at the edge. no lace. rich roasty malt aroma with dark fruit earthy coffee wet wood and spice. lots of fruit flavors unclear if its a by-product of the coffee or yeast malt booze or some other component. coffee shows best after 30 minutes or so of warming up. booze is present but almost an afterthought amidst the cacaphony of fruit and coffee flavors. medium plus body with some prickly heat. smoother mouthfeel as it warms. lengthy flavorful finish with a bit of sweetness. very good.
5494,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.8,pours a dark opaque brown- black with a small brown head. the aroma is coffee bourbon and roasty malts. flavor is dark fruits brown sugar roasted malt and coffee. medium- full bodied and a little acidic. finishes clean with a little tingling on the tongue either from the ph or the alcohol. very good. easy drinking.
5495,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.24,aroma is bourbon coffee chocolate dark malts and slightly earthy. the flavor is fruit/dark fruit chocolate mild coffee and an acidic dark malt/warming bourbon alcohol finish.
5496,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.84,this is the 2022 vintage with burundian turihamwe coffee blend from intelligentsia. poured from the 16.9 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.  look: the beer is a pure opaque black with no light coming through. topped with a creamy finger thick head with ok retention. this is a real imperial looking stout.  smell: creamy aroma of mocha and fresh espresso. deep chocolate notes throughout. not as much bourbon as in the original variant on first glance which may be a good thing. this is inviting. dark fruits somewhere within. as the beer warms more of the bourbon and woody noes come out a bit. vanilla makes an appearance as well as this warms and a slight spice.  taste: chocolatey up front with notes of mocha in between roasted and toasted malt. some vanilla quickly covered up by bourbon which is immediately more evident than in the aroma. brown sugar creme caramel. surprising that this beer retains a sweeter than expected character throughout. finishes with just as touch of bourbon underneath a really smooth almost fruity and spicy coffee note. again not as heavy handed with the bourbon which is definitely there but much more nuanced.  feel: creamy with light carbonation. coating. finishes smooth with just a hint of tingling alcohol at the very end.  overall: oh yeah this is a good one. i love that it doesnt try to hammer you over the head with the bourbon flavor. instead it slowly brings you in with a wide variety of flavors. the spotlight here is the turihamwe coffee blend which really makes a difference in the flavor profile that shows in the end product. a premium product for sure but it lives up to expectations revealing something new at every sip. a special experience that will probably show up in my top 10.
5497,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.89,2022 vintage:  poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a snifter.  look- black medium brown frothy head plentiful visible particulate at margins average head retention and lacing.  smell- coffee cacao bourbon oak cherry high strength of scent.  taste- bourbon coffee cacao oak high strength of flavor.  feel- between medium and full bodied moderately mouth coating average carbonation highly mouth warming high bitterness smooth.  overall- black with plentiful visible particulate at the margins. strong bouquet of coffee cacao and bourbon. vibrant flavors of bourbon coffee cacao and oak. body was between medium and full with high mouth warming properties. dynamic flavors and bouquet made for a fantastic drinking experience!
5498,Roggenbier,3.02,had an interesting look but positive end there. had to try this style but definitely not in my palate. would guess thus is an avg or avg+ offer for this style.
5499,Roggenbier,4.28,iron hill media.  a: murky orange with nice bubbles. thin white head with little lacing.  s: bready and malty with definite banana.  t: moderate sweetness and light hop bitterness. banana is the most prominent. notes of chocolate and caramel. very nice finish.  m: medium to full body that was thick and chewy. the carbonation was lively. very nice.  o: this is one of my favorites from iron hill. very drinkable.
5500,Roggenbier,4.3,served on cask during the recent iron hill - lancaster x-mas in july event. this version has been aged on caraway seeds.  a - pours murky orange with a small one finger tall white head leaving little to no lacing down the glass.  s - smells of bready rye spice clove sweet caramel malt banana light earthy hops and the spicy/sweet caraway. this has a ton going on yet it remains true to style.  t - starts off with a nice mix of spicy rye and chewy caraway slowly giving way to a mix of wheat banana clove light hop bitterness and some sweet caramel malt. this one has a lot going for it yet it remains very drinkable. the finish is a mix of chewiness and spice lingering for a short period of time.  m - medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. spicy chewy feel with plenty of it lingering through the finish.  o - very nice. i am glad i started with this one. i typically don\t enjoy too many chewy beers but this one was a revelation. i really liked the flavors and it never got to the point of being overpowering. great stuff.
5501,Roggenbier,4.42,on handpump at iron hill lancaster. aged with caraway seeds.  similar but distinct from the draft version. the softer carbonation and lack of c02 brings out the rye spiciness much stronger than the draft. pour is similar to draft opaque and murky copper brown with a bubbly fleeting clear head. initially has traditional dunkelweiss flavors; clove fruit banana and yeast. the rye spice and breadiness of the caraway. i liked the base and i like this treatment even more. ive only previously had troegs scratch roggen but im very impressed by both versions of iron hills.
5502,Roggenbier,4.08,christmas in july indeed. before santa arrives i have time to sip through this roggenbier served from a handpump. oh yeah and the ale has been aged on caraway seeds.  a: from a cask the roggenbier is hazy and clouded to the point of opacity. the result is a dunkel-like ale dark but not deeply brown. the cask renders a thin head bubbly and thin.  s: the nose is very weizen-like plenty of sweet clove and phenols. rye is slow to emerge spicy and bready. when it finally gets primed up the caraway and rye are sweet and anisey a complement to the weizens softness.  t: oh my...the caraway aging was a brilliant idea augmenting the spicy rye presence with chewy goodness. first things first though. the wheat beer starts off with clove and banana sweet reminders of the potency of the german yeast. as the initial weizen aspects pass the rye and caraway become all the more apparent. the darker caraway adds depth and breadiness spices particularly anise as well. the cask serving temperature prolongs the breadiness. the base roggenbier is good but this the caraway pushes it to the next level. get it while its still on.  m: a sweet mouthfeel that yo-yos between weizen and rye. super added awesomeness points for the caraway.
5503,Roggenbier,4.5,6.4% abv.  a: this was a murky cloudy dark golden brown. it poured with a thick creamy head.  s: big bruised bananas with hints of chocolate toffee and spicy rye.  t: more cocoa here than the smell suggested but the banana still dominates. rye spiciness and hints of clove at the finish.  m: very thick and chewy overall.  o: this is becoming a favorite style of mine one i rarely get to try unfortunately. this was well worth ending my long standing boycott of iron hill growlers for. in fact ill probably go back for another fill of my new ih screw top.
5504,Roggenbier,4.05,first had: on tap at iron hill media pa  a very tasty rye beer. poured a cloudy burnt sienna with a healthy white head that retained well. light spices and banana aroma. toasted malts up front on the taste very organic and earthy with a thick banana taste coming through and rye sourness in the finish with a hint of spice. smooth medium body and very drinkable.
5505,Roggenbier,3.89,had on tap at phoenixville  appearance: red/brown in color 1/2 inch head cloudy high carbonation  smell: bananas and light rye  taste: toasted malt start with an earthy middle with the banana and rye creeping in and the rye lingering around for the aftertaste  mouthfeel: medium carbonation semi-sweet with a spicy rye finish medium/heavy bodied  drinkability: a nice alternative to a hefe. i like how the rye is there but not too overpowering. a sipper due to its heaviness but a beer i would like to have again.
5506,Roggenbier,4,a: hazy dark orange with minimal head that disappears quickly and some lace.  s: clove and a bit of sourness and a slight banana finish.  t: sour rye flavor with clove and banana bread notes.  m: petulant bubbles with a clean yet sour finish.  d: easy drinker for the change of winter to spring. sourness is balanced and does not build.
5507,Roggenbier,4,very hazy caramel colour topped by a short cap of off-white foam. good head retention. the aroma was mostly bread crust with some spicy rye and mild banana character. mild bitterness with sweet caramel rye and mild banana notes throughout. bread crust appeared at the end and it finished quickly with a burst of spicy rye. slick oily texture with moderate carbonation and medium body. a little creamy. quite an enjoyable pint. lots of interesting flavours are present but they dont tire the palate. if this shows up again definitely try it.
5508,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.6,can into a willi. trillium neipas are so consistently good. if i had one complaint its that this was a little hot with the hop burn which hey its galaxy - sometimes that happens - but it wasnt horrible and the flavor more than made up for it. explosion of tropical flavors bright vibrant with a great mouthfeel. a top notch hazy.
5509,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,5,ddh is stroooong!!
5510,Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.5,love me some trill ipas
5511,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,1,this is not beer and doesnt belong on this site!  drain-pour!
5512,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,5,look-light orange color smell-strong mango with sweetness on the smell taste-strong mango with hints of sweetness feel-carb overall-a very good drink
5513,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,5,my favorite beer by far. i know it\s sweet and some may say it\s not a beer. i don\t care! i love that it tastes great unlike any of the other ritas i\ve tried. i just wish i could find it in the texoma area!
5514,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,2.21,pours a headless orange yellow. nose is canned mango juice and nectar and unlike other entrants in the rita series does a good job of hiding the booze. taste follows nectar dominant and only on the finish does the cheap alcohol begin to raise its head. of the ritas ive sampled the best of a sad bunch.
5515,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,4.71,mang-o-rita has lots of fizzy bubbles and no foam nor lacing. the appearance is opaque orange. the aroma is of mangoes and pale malt and the flavor is the same with a splenda brand sweetness. mouthfeel is medium and mang-o-rita finishes (high-fructose corn syrup) drying. its top-notch for what it is but i just dont like what it is.  rjt
5516,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,3.16,(25 oz can code 19173; purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)  l: as is typical with this line (shaking my head being too familiar with it but only review-cently) hazy liquid with a fizzy fleeting foam... liquid color is almost on par with irn bru or an igloo cooler  s: mango jolly rancher - nothing more to add  t: mango soda syrup?; bit of spectrum swipe of medicinal phenolic saccharine flavors in the finish... intensely (sugary) flavorful but only 10% malt liquor-ish if that...  f: slight fuzzy fizz on contact; vaguely drawn-out/slick... like a flat soda halfway through... extra 1/4 pt for the ethanol being super smooth  o: another gap-filling review... flavor-assaulting soft-drinky fizzy liquid boozy candy... like a fizzy boones farm thang... at this age i rarely try to get drunk but id hate to be reduced to relying on this to take me away; blech!... (1529)
5517,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,1.54,whoo boy this one is something. in my earlier drinking days id go grab one of these and down it while i watched my friend kelly stream games. it was an abhorrent experience for the most part every swig made my face contort and exhale like a noob drinker.  overwhelming fruity smell. the overall taste is artificial mango cheap margarita mix like what they put in the dollaritas at applebees and beer water. syrupy as it gets. i only punished myself with this a few times and apparently the other flavors are worse so i guess i should be thankful. not sure why i ever had one more than once.
5518,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,5,love this but cant find it in stores.
5519,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,2.4,is it ok to essentially start a review with well this is the least shitty variation of this beer? i think its a good summary of the review. anyways pours as usual looking nothing like beer looks more like some tonic water with nothing but alka seltzer and some coloring added. what a weird fizzy creation. aroma was slightly mango-esque so it didn\t miss the mark by much there.  taste the mango character is also there in the taste. but its all downhill after hitting that extract. still super fizzy. lacks a malt yeast or hop aspect of the beer but hey this hits that adjunct spot with some sugar added in to cover up the alcohol. its nowhere near as offputting as the lime one is.
5520,Superior,3.78,drank 01.06.23 in the southern yucatán mexico. really hit the spot and despite being a mass produced corn lager is really smooth. no hop presence whatsoever but thin thirst quenching when cold extremely tasty when warm and just a good cheap lager.
5521,Superior,3.47,300ml bottle bbd oct 2022 poured into a vintage bow tie glass at fridge temp 4.6% abv. the beer pours bright light gold in color with nearly white head. the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and island. the aroma is slight with a hint of malt. the taste is semisweet corny slightly tangy malt with a side of vague vegetable and negligible bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. diacetyl is present to a noticeable degree. overall fair aal.
5522,Superior,2,a generic mexican lager.
5523,Superior,2.99,poured from the 300ml bellita bottle (which is in fact the same beer as regular bottled superior) this bottle also says its 4.6% not 3.6%. maybe the 3.6% is alcohol by weight.  the look is like any other adjunct lager has a light head that fizzles down over a few minutes into a few clusters of floating bubbles. very light not a lot else going on here average carbonation. crystal clear.  the smell is very vague with a sweetness and hint of hops but nothing that really stands out.  the taste is similar to the smell but with a stong corn flavor. no bitterness basically just corn with lager flavor but easy to put down and nothing necessarily offensive. would be better if it was colder. right at the front there is a mineral flavor that isnt the best but doesnt really get in the way. pretty boring.  feel is denser than you might expect but still could be a beach beer but not the best work beer. maybe good for drinking on a summer night ice cold but it better be cold. quite sticky as it warms.  overall its a cheap mexican lager with a bit too much corn. wish it had a bit more gops to balance it out. i suppose balance is the main thing it lacks. all it there is here is corn flavor and id appreciate it if there was something more but if you find it for cheap in the full size i would still give it a try.
5524,Superior,3.03,clean light adjunct lager beer. in taste and appearance very comparable to amstel light. so happens to be another product in the heineken portfolio. for what it is albeit remove the import price here in the us..... and also the small 10.14 fl oz bottles the beer itself is a good product. ymmv.
5525,Superior,3.5,not bad ... its similar to victoria .. i drank 6 10oz bottles with no complaints .. it is what it is  this aint no beer for pouring in a glass and pondering nuances
5526,Superior,2.29,i mean mexican beer is pretty bad right out the gate this stuff takes it to the next level below. i actually like drinking a modelo from time to time not bad in terms of light beer. so i tried this one thinking hey its probably like a modelo. it was cheap $2.50 tall boy so what could what could go wrong? pours a golden color with a decent fizzy head nothing on the aroma side but you probably already assumed that. the taste is more soapy seltzer than beer - honestly this stuff doesnt taste like any kind of lager i can think of except maybe michelob ultra which is a whole other story. check it out if you dig mexican lagers otherwise grab a modelo and some hot cheetos.
5527,Superior,3.3,24 oz can from plaid pantry 4.6% alc now. clear corn oil coloured body. head is actually quite impressive. huge billowy/rocky white. aroma paper and wet hay. taste more of the paper and hay and some white bread .not as bad as the aroma suggested. mouth feel is thin. well carbonated. not the worst mexican lager.
5528,Superior,3.1,clear pale gold with three fingers of white head. splotches of lace are forming as the levels drop. smell is corny and sweet. taste is sweet corny and just a pinch of spicy hops. mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. the finish is mildly dry and mostly sweet. overall a nice enough cervesa. best by date is sept. 2021.
5529,Superior,2.81,clear yellow colored beer with a wisp of a white colored head.   smells sweet and fairly corny. toasted grain scent. faint noel hop scent mostly it is grassy.  starts out neutral. mildly sweet and tasting of mineral water. mild bitterness. no real hop presence. bland.  mouthfeel is watery.  overall just a beer. sees no reason to ever try it again.
5530,Superior,2.87,look: crystal clear pale yellow with a billowing white head that slowly craters to a lid leaving behind great lacing aroma: light wafts of pilsner malt cracker-like malt floral hops and cereal grains taste: sweet malt and grains come on strong followed by some light but welcome floral notes. honestly this didn’t seem like it would be this sweet from what i read from the nose. as that fades a little corn comes in and finishes with more grains mouthfeel: light but fairly full a little cloying from the sweetness somewhat clean and crisp but the sweetness definitely takes from that overall: ehh this isn’t terrible but it’s far from good as that sweetness really detracts from what i assume is coming with a cerveza – crisp clean and light. i’d never heard of nor seen this beer so had to try it and at $2.99/24oz can it wasn’t an expensive gamble but i’d grab a modelo bohemia victoria or tecate every single time over this
5531,Superior,3.2,appearance: clear lightly yellow goldenish. smell: not too noticeable; thin corn i guess like a beer though. taste aint too bad really; has almost a touch of a sorta simmering sweetness in it. ok on the feel. overall its a nice easy simple beer to just take a moment or 2 and enjoy. dribble a real small salt splash to it though. btw the can i drained it from sez 4.6% alc./vol. mucho better that 3.6 si?
5532,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,3.86,can poured into a mountain rambler brewery pint glass  a: pours hazy golden amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely.  s: almost candied citrus and melon tropical and stone fruit earthy spicy herbal notes a touch of pine biscuity malt and a little caramel honey sweetness.  t: interesting mix of citrus tropical and stone fruit lemon peel melon papaya lime apricot a hint of pineapple and faint tangerine spicy herbal notes fairly earthy a touch of cedar/ pine biscuity malt and a little caramel honey sweetness.  m: just a touch on the fuller side of medium body slightly prickly moderate carbonation yet it still sits like a silk pillow on the palate.  o: im not sure if ive been spoiled by really good neipas out here in ca or if im just not the biggest fan of trilliums style or both. (this is not the first time that ive had one of their highly rated beers only to be kinda disappointed.) the malt base is beautifully smooth but the hops come through kinda muddied because of that spicy earthy herbal presence which given that its prominently mentioned in the description is definitely intentional. i can kinda see how some people would be into this more than i am but i think there are far better ways to add depth of flavor and let the marquis hop shine.
5533,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.5,pours a hazy yellow orange color with a short and medium bodied off white colored head that laces the glass a bit as it fades. smells of melon mainly a bit of citrus and malt at the end of it. tastes has a melon sweetness up front that fades to a more bitter hop finish at the end with some citrus in there as well. feels lighter than it looks velvety feeling and a nice amount of carbonation. overall excellent.
5534,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.44,a: pours an extremely hazy/murky bright golden pale orange in color with moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate bright yellow + bright orange + pale golden yellow + peach + apricot colored highlights. the beer has a three finger tall dense sudsy foamy white head that reduces to a handful of small patches of thin film surrounded by a large patch of mottled very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  s: moderate to strong aromas of citrus/orange zest + citrus/tangerine + tropical/pineapple + melon/cantaloupe + herbal + pine/resinous hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of biscuit + pale + wheat malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness.  t: upfront there are light to moderate flavors of biscuit + pale + wheat malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness. that is followed by moderate to strong flavors of citrus/orange zest + citrus/tangerine + tropical/pineapple + melon/cantaloupe + herbal + pine/resinous hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which fades away fairly quickly leaving moderate lingering tropical + citrus + herbal hops flavors.  m: light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. slightly crisp upfront with a moderate amount of soft/fluffiness mid-body and a light amount of dryness in the finish.  o: easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a very pleasant slightly crisp + soft/fluffy mouthfeel. enjoyable with a wonderful hop profile - citrus + citrus/zest + tropical + herbal + pine/resinous.
5535,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.69,picked up a single from the blue door bottleshop in hendersonville 10-7-22 for $8.50. no canning date; consumed 10-11-22.  beer poured a hazy golden orange with an okay white head.  nose is awesome! full of citrus tropical and herbal fragrances.  taste is really nicely done. ultra-light but standard ipa pale malt base is inoculated nicely with an neipa yeast strain that provides a touch of stone fruit flavor. hop additions provide a nice orange and melon flavor injection. finishes with a nice pine and rind bitterness; 7/10 on my scale.  mouthfeel is near perfection ultra-light and refreshing.  overall a fantastic neipa definitely amongst the best i have had!
5536,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.9,#130 yummy!
5537,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.5,everything here is as expected cloudy gold with a small head citrus aroma and flavors medium sweetness with a bit of bitterness. but very solid depth of flavor. close to amazing for something you can find on a shelf in many places.
5538,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.19,on tap at monks in sioux falls sd  a well balance but very ugly beer. do not miss this one. 4.25  a - pours an opaque chalky yellow. almost like one of those fruited sours. maybe the ugliest ipa i have ever seen.  s - but i loved the sedate almost not there/but there aroma. citra singular slightly fruity slightly resiny but not over hopped with respect to rest of the beer. 4.25  t - some minor chalkiness but balance by a good intense resiny hoppiness. so much so that i had some back of the throat irritation. 4.25  mf - medium body with an almost acrid finish. dry but a hint of sweetness. 4.25
5539,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.65,pretty fresh 12 oz can in a chilled pint glass not too much head but nice. a little colder than idea. really nice beer! hoppy for a pale true as advertised for a double. nice lemony finish very smooth. very drinkable think i’ll have another!
5540,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.4,chilled pint can into a pint glass. hazy fruity juicy the citra hop shines and it’s slightly bitter. great to get ahold of this one. totally enjoyed. may i have another please?
5541,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.29,a - pours a bright orange with a two finger fizzy white head. light soapy lacing.  s - aroma is pineapple orange lemon and resinous hops.  t - the taste is candied lemon pineapple orange peel grapefruit and a long lingering hop bite.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. creamy mouthfeel with a soft crisp finish.  o - solid.
5542,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.77,brief review:  o: holy shit this beer is good. that was my first thought. i honestly didn\t go into this with much expectation other than i knew i\d at leas like it since it\s tg and a sue beer. i didn\t love pseudosue nor the galaxy dry-hopped version. thought they were just okay and potentially over-hyped. haven\t had either in several years. but once i cracked this i could tell right away it was special. haze-bomb in the glass. huge pineapple and mango aromas. mouthfeel and finish is super rich and juicy. this is honestly up there with some of the tree house hazy\s i had back in the day. also didn\t know this was a top 150 beer until i looked it up and i have to say it\s deserves every ounce of the praise.  recommendation: a surprisingly great extra hoppy edition of the classic pseudosue. this is by far the best in the line must-try and not terribly hard to get either.
5543,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.42,best little bro of the king sue
5544,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.42,this is a neipa by all measures these days so rating as such. clearly nothing in common with zombie dust or snpa. regardless pours a beautiful opaque aromas and mouthfeel are a bit sharper than anticipated but the citra flavors are yummy for certain. glad i finally found this one.
5545,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.31,from the bottle at pies and pints morgantown. 9/4/23. happy labor day!  aromas of banana pear candied lemon light clove and sweet brown bread. coats the mouth well.  sweeter and more carbonated than the weihenstephaner yet a great offering. perhaps not as deep in complexity as we would like.  very very glad to to have tried this one.
5546,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4,not my favorite style but that being said this is pretty good. big foam light golden color. definitely a wheat beer with some citrus flavors. easy to drink i like the bigger bottle. it does have the german flair. good one!
5547,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.62,05l bottle dated 04.03.24 included in a mixed six pack purchased in the brewery hotel lobby in aying. this style is one of my least favorites but when i drink a world-class example i immediately know. and this is quickly evident upon taking a few gulps. perfectly balanced malt bill and yeast qualities without being overly spiced. creamy smooth satisfying. what a beer!
5548,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.33,very interesting. feels the typical wheat taste is more subtle refined it has almost champagne like quality reminds of saison or even ne ipa (nelson hops). taste is pears green apples vanilla a hint of cloves and banana. slightly bitter and dry end. medium body at max. different and very nice
5549,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.3,on tap: cloudy to a high degree but not perfectly blocking all light. lovely uniform white cap promotes a lot of initial lacing. feel is a bit light and bubbly and not quite as smooth as i expected. taste is a dialed down version of the nose which is heavy on a mix of not too ripe banana and spice. as i sip i appreciate the balance in the more and more as it is pretty even-keeled while still exhibiting the qualities the style is known for.
5550,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.62,appearance: cloudy straw yellow. white creamy mousse-like head with good retention.  aroma: banana clove and grassy/herbal notes.  flavor and aftertaste: yeasty flavors. spicy hops. restrained bitterness.  mouthfeel: medium to light bodied. soft feel. moderate carbonation. dry finish.  overall: excellent hefeweizen. has all the expected hallmarks of a german made hefe. detected a grassy herbal note that i have not in most german made versions which added to the interest. short drying finish. well crafted.
5551,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.3,two 11.2 oz bottles l1028 into a tall weiss glass. l: pours matte murky gold and is straw at base a white 1/2 creamy head w vg retention down to a thick skin well carbonated and good to final sip almost no lacing. the lack of lacing could be due to high temps and high humidity. s: banana clove floral yeast. t: banana bread clove yeast wheat nutmeg a hint of fruit peach a touch of salt precise balance of flavors and is moderately pale. f: gently crisp then smooth soft med to med-light body with a slightly chubby middle and a clean dry med-fast finish. o: amazing whisper finish along with incredible taste make this beer outstanding. superb drinkability and flow. quenching. would love to find it on tap.
5552,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.18,hazy paler than expected. looks beautiful in the glass. light and smooth nice carbonation. creamy and full mouth feel. banana bready yeast and wheat with lovely subtle spice coming through. sweet and dry finish. beautiful specimen.
5553,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.19,smooth crisp and spicy. different finish than other hefeweizens i’ve tasted. quite enjoyable.
5554,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.71,purchased as a 12oz bottle from the blue door for $4.50. poured into a weizen glass.  l - hazy pale orange with a three-finger pale white head. head dies down after a minute. really good lacing. s - candy. bubblegum clove and freshly-baked bread. t - closely follows nose. super balanced. bit of a lemon peel note. finish is dry and full of wheat. f - medium in body with medium carbonation. refreshing and super drinkable. o - cant believe i havent formally reviewed this yet. ive had this a million times! fantastic hefe closely rivaling weihenstephan. great to drink in the middle of the day. will purchase again. definitely recommend.
5555,Ayinger Bräuweisse,3.57,from carwyn cellars october 2022. drunk in march 2023.  l: hazy sunset yellow in the glass with a large pillowy head that didnt last as long as expected (yes my glass is clean!). small amounts of carbonation can be seen in the glass.  s: cloves bubblegum vanilla and candied lemon all heading in the dr pepper cherry direction. no malt/wheat body discernable.  t: quite sweet with the bubblegum and ripe pear. that dr pepper note is there too but i wonder now if thats the ripe pear that im tasting. regardless it brings to mind that chalky dr pepper cherry taste that doesnt taste at all like cherry but remains stubbornly associated with it theres a long sweet finish with the vanilla coming out retronasally after the swallow. the overt bubblegum and extra sweetness mark this one down for me.  m: carbonation is mild and the mouthfeel is full and as expected from the hazy appearance of the beer.  o: im resolutely sticking to the style in rating this one and the sweetness that i pick up and that dr pepper note means the beer is not as refreshing and light as a hefeweizen should be so im marking it down.  cheers! #214
5556,Hazy IPA,2.94,not my favorite bit of a pungent/sulfur note.
5557,Hazy IPA,3.74,not bad but not great. looks like a golden ipa of the hazy variety in the glass with nice white lacing. smell is a bit too grassy for me as is the aftertaste. mouthfeel is light. i would prefer a bit more mouthfeel with a fruitier flavor but it is what it is and its not bad. worth trying.
5558,Hazy IPA,3.52,its a pale yellow hazy with a white head. theres a little bit of citrus note in the aroma but not a lot. the flavor starts off with a mild citrus and sweetness combo thats unassuming before a small hop bite shows up. its not bad and worthy of another glass but its not among the top.
5559,Hazy IPA,3.53,from a 12oz can:  appearance: hazy yellow good head.  smell: mild citrus.  taste: a little hoppy bite at first but then settles into the typical soft mildly sweet citrus taste of most hazies. maybe a touch more bitterness of citrus rind in the finish.  overall: last beer from the stone mix pack hazies used to be kind of fun but ive had too many that give the same experience. this one from stone blends in with the pack. the beer is fine but nothing too exciting.
5560,Hazy IPA,2.75,stone! one of those og brewers with the crazy devil logo. man that takes me back a couple decades or more. youre not worthy.  regrettably in as lazy a segue as youre likely to see today this bland brew is also not worthy. i mostly get watery bitterness like a mermaid in unrequited love. nelson dying in the depths of victory unable to savor the triumph at trafalgar. a diver missing a podium finish for improper speedos.  love ya guys and gals but this stuff doesnt deserve to share a zip code with the likes of ruination.
5561,Hazy IPA,3.43,picked up a 6 of this the other day from the weird store in fernley. so much out of date beer but this was a new beer so it couldnt be that old.  pours a hazy yellow color. 1/4 white head. nothing out of the ordinary going on here appearance wise. the aroma was kind of lacking sabro can pop it didn\t here. el dorado and azacca are noticeable but giving vague not sharp nor specific hop tones. if anything comes off like generic citra giving some citrus of a sweeter variety. but also with some sawdust.  the taste is equally ho hum. there is a light tropical juiciness coming through but there is also a bitterness that doesnt jive well with the hazy ipa substyle. its a definite walk back from the early days of stones hoppy goodness. doesnt seem like it has a wheat/oat flaked base in addition to barley. doesnt hit that smooth note. it was affordable but far from inspiring. kind of like a recreation use only person in middle age on a dating app. yowza.
5562,Hazy IPA,3.26,pours a predictably hazy yellow color with a foamy white head. smells of tropical fruits. tastes a lot like the aroma. sweet fruity flavors. medium body. its ok for the style.
5563,Hazy IPA,3.5,a solid-but-not-for-me juicy ipa with orange and tropical fruit flavor and nose. smells more fruity than ipa. unusually easy-drinking for an ipa which means that for an ipa lover the aftertaste might be too bland and malty. there is some bitterness but nothing highlighting any of the piney aspects of hops. this is the ipa for someone who likes blue moon. (okay maybe that\s a bit harsh.) it\s nowhere near as good as their other beers but better for someone who finds stone\s style too aggressive. disappointing for me but i\d still drink this any day over most beer...
5564,Hazy IPA,4.14,part of a stone ipa assortment pack. poured from 12 oz can a hazy light honey tone. decent foamy head that did not persist. plenty of tropical fruit in the aroma . . . mango and guava. pretty juicy in the mouth taste seems a little weaker than that up front aroma. a little light on the tongue crisp finish. still thinking it all over . . . pretty mellow.
5565,Hazy IPA,3.78,it’s not nearly as good as sierra nevada’s hazy. but it’s not bad.
5566,Hazy IPA,3.82,beer pours a hazy honey color with a foamy soapy 4 fingers of white head. the haze is a bit light but definitely there. heavy sticky lacing on the glass.  lots of tropical fruits on the nose. mango pineapple and guava like scents. some pithy citrus as well. faint hint of pine far in the background.  very juicy on the taste. definitely getting the mango and guava type of fruits on the taste. a light hint of the citrus pith giving it the smallest amount of bitterness on the finish.  mouth feel is a bit on the upward end of light. not quite into the medium. very light on the bitterness.  overall this is a quality ipa with light bitterness. lots of juice notes. not like a sugary juice more like a natural fruit juice. i understand companies move on but i still miss the scorpion bowl ipa. it was a nice juicy one like this with a bit more bitterness for a little bite. this is really a good ipa for those scared that the beer is going to be overly bitter because it is an ipa. another job well done to stone brewing.
5567,IPA,3.46,fourteen years ago when i moved from california to massachusetts it was the first local beer i fell in love with. it was always a lot better on draft than from the bottle and i still will order it at logan airport or in boston restaurants if nothing that holds great appeal to me is available. it’s a little too bland for my taste now. still a good solid ipa.
5568,IPA,4,just looking through all the ratings and reviews this beer has garnered during its long run and cannot find anything new to add except to reemphasize many of its fine qualities. from its handsome appearance to the tasty balanced finish it is a solid well made 4 that has not abandoned its roots.
5569,IPA,4.32,appearance: clear amber fluffy white head with good retention.  aroma: citrus and toasted bready malt.  flavor: citrus toast and bread. moderately sweet. moderate bitterness.  mouthfeel: drying moderate carbonation medium length finish.  overall: another iconic old school ipa. pours a clear amber color producing a nice fluffy white head with good retention. the cascade and cluster hops provide citrus aromas of grapefruit and oranges that distinguish the nose. you also get some toasty bread hints from the lightly roasted malts. tastes include citrus notes combined with the sweet malt that you would expect from a beer of amber color. bitterness is quite restrained; however the sweetness is as well giving it a nice balance between the two. it finishes on the dry side with a medium aftertaste. well crafted classically balanced ipa.
5570,IPA,3.57,pours a slightly cloudy deep golden orange 1.5 soapy head with good retention and lacing. nose is malt and roasted barley with a nice background note of pine and earthy spice. taste is also malt forward though there\s enough hop presence to keep things balance. would like a bit more bright spicy hop but this still satisfies. mouthfeel is moderate with light carbonation.
5571,IPA,3.67,good traditional ipa. certainly more balanced than many out there today
5572,IPA,3.75,12 oz bottle pulled out of a cooler full of ice water. nice genie of steam rises from the bottle when popped open. smells original classic ipa. tastes like an un- fussied with ipa. it’s hoppy crisp malt balanced. feels carbed and smooth tingly. overall “just an ipa” in the fondest of terms.
5573,IPA,3.92,i haven’t had this ipa for a while. good to revisit in light of all the unbalanced weird flavored ipas i’ve been tasting in the past few years. mildly hoppy good malt backbone standard fare. good go to ipa.
5574,IPA,1.76,real bad.
5575,IPA,3.75,a solid starter ipa of the traditional back in the day variety i drank a ton of it for a while - similar to but inferior to in every aspect the great snpa.
5576,IPA,3.74,pours a slightly hazed gold body with a billowing white frothy foam head that has moderate retention and leaves a ton of thin sticky sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a patchy froth cap with defined halo  aroma is sweet and grainy malt forward with floral and slightly piney hops on the wings  taste is sweet and juicy with a floral flair up front that fades to an earthy light bitterness tinged with pine with the finish  mouthfeel in fairly thin bodied with high carbonation running slightly watery and grainy with a pillowed juicy edge before finishing mildly dry and leaving a slightly sweet herbal aftertaste tinged with earthy bitterness  overall: solid session ipa that runs mostly sweet and juicy but manages a solid balance thanks to a cascade hop bittersweetness. wouldnt consider it one of the greats but its in the top 15 for me as far as highbrow craft ipa flagships.
5577,IPA,3.22,not one of the better ones i have had from harpoon but still solid enough to enjoy. comparatively speaking its not as sweet smelling or juicy as others but the mouthfeel was full-bodied which made up for a less than favorable taste. again when you take it all in its solid. just not necessarily memorable.
5578,Art,4.86,batch 6. probably my number one want and what a treat to check if off up at the source. wonderfully complex from aroma through the finish -- bit of a wild funk character bit of white wine fruitiness bit of drying oak bit of honey sweetness bit of herbal hops and a bit of... english muffin? just fantastic all around. this may be the best regularly available beer in the world  98/100
5579,Art,4.49,a: the decanter tinges vermilion on the initial impact which transfers to a vivid – metallic – orange. that luminosity tops a deep saffron base with a pastel orange hue as gamboge tones streak throughout. proportionately an askew cap that comes to a vista white inch while steadily downsizing to the ½ in where the palette succumbs a snow drift highlight. the configuration has the hydrophobic polypeptides & bitter acids to modestly cling when retreating to the ¼ in. at this point a latticework with a residual nuance to dimly stick as the retention retains an enacting solidity. albeit shy on the aesthetic decree seeing the descending collar to the minute. the layouts have a transparency upon the transfers which have an opulent appeal early on while a circuitous convention develops amid the pressing radiations  s: a density set to esters as they constantly web around the oak casks while the grain bill pitches a smart rusticity. there is an isoamyl octanoate innuendo near the persuasive peach accompaniments which takes a torani syrup form. in this respect a softly tart & fuzzy recording that’s lightly backed by the oak tannin exchanges while the hop effect lends a floral regularity. the phenolic compounds gradually characterize on cobwebs aside a ripened mustiness given the vintage works over the decant. however a narrow presentation on the inaugurating course as the directive is more symphonic to the seeds and skins above the alluding crops. the advancements have a stronger denotation on the aged strains with a grain bill that ties in pit + trench silos while maintaining a profitable presence on esters. markedly a harmonization amongst the ranching & pastoral foregrounds to the milder fruits ascribing pears berries and apricots. moreover an undercroft ease on the °f upticks while a dry torrontés similitude dispatches besides the barrel aldehydes. the cessations retain an earthed ruralism against the – loitering – eugenol structures beyond the leathery tannin constitutes  t: fermentable complexities with a soft cask neatness which traits ethyl acetates to porous oak codas. namely an oxidized kindliness that has a solvent growth under fresh clingstone peaches which impute seedy connotations per the inferred pits. the french oak barrel offers mild spices to complex polymers where phenolic aldehydes pitch vanillin. meanwhile malt backs the bready accounts with dorset knobs & pie crusts as hops back a longleaf pine essence while ketones casually mingle. chiefly an inducement on raspberry ketones alongside strawberries & melons before connoting emerald drop pluots. a buildout on fleshed fruit to palm syrup as catacomb dust delicately descends on golden silk spiders. coupled with cattle yard atmospheres to leathery tannins as a transferred aridity elevates above the rustic granularities. the timing to weather – over the course – reverberates that inaugurating solvency thru an oloroso sherry implementation which offers an oxidative nuttiness to exotic thickets. on the rear side a perceptible murmur on cloves & nutmeg while guaiacols quietly coat the codicils over smoke as polyphenol compounds dictate  m: there is a passing rain to flagstone texture from a minerality component that later transcends on seafronts. the surface is soft with calm acidic natures given the modest vivacities which attenuate steadily. in consequence a dry formation that benefits over the cask scriptures when depicting the hydrolysable substances  o: yeast grandiosities that are perceptively backed across the bitter – earthy – hop effects while phenolic companions lurk. on balance a sensitive malt mannerism with a loyal intention to not annihilate the course as the french oak barrels impress. the timetables are advantageous to the vintage over an improved dryness from cut sugars to cranked up/interconnected esters
5580,Art,4.41,b7/2016 bottling bottle pour onsight 15cl into tulip  smell is wine and flowers taste is similar and body is extremely thin minimal spice/zest compared to standard saison finish is short and dry. very simple  overall i would say this is good but not really the complexity of other hf that blew me away in the past (cd33 flora cuvee)
5581,Art,5,clean balanced perfection! absolute @&$%ing magic!
5582,Speedway Stout,4.35,poured from a 16 ounce can the body is very dark and opaque. small initial head and light lacing.  aroma is mix of malty char dark chocolate and coffee. delightful.  taste follows nose with an increased flavor of the coffee. add a nice boozy flavor not too hot. id prefer a bit more char but this beer is delicious.  at first a lighter mouthfeel than expected/hoped for but still solid. once warmed the mouthfeel was nicely creamy. carbonation light.
5583,Speedway Stout,3.87,awesome
5584,Speedway Stout,4.52,(canned on 3/10/23) poured a dark chocolate color into a standard pint glass with a caramel 2 fingers high head that lingered and left an abundant amount of fine lacing behind. earthy malt aroma is present with strong coffee and chicory presence up front. anticipate from the smell that the flavor will be mainly coffee but it balances out with a nice malty backbone and a bittersweet chocolate finish. full bodied not for the light hearted and @12% abv this is a sipper. another one well done respect!
5585,Speedway Stout,3.92,12oz bottled on nov. 16 2021 (no thanks to the barely visible etching in the glass above the label that i can only see now that the bottle is room temp) poured into a spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 12% abv. the beer pours dense black with light brown colored head. the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a web of lacing. the aroma is mild with roasted malt and coffee. the taste is bittersweet roasted malt with weak coffee. moderate bitterness. mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. overall ok but not the world class beer i expected. not likely to purchase another alesmith product with the hidden date etching...
5586,Speedway Stout,4.5,look: black as night and even my gentle pour initiates a billowing brown head that holds as a pillow and refuses to settle eventually relenting and leaving sheets of lacing behind aroma: espresso roasted barley baker’s cocoa ethanol blackstrap molasses freshly baked bread dark cherries light earthiness and piloncillo taste: starts out with a ton of rich dark chocolate that hinges on the edge of full-blown bitter cocoa and quickly joined by espresso light cherry and roast. these go back and forth with a nice bread/earthy profile in the middle with subtle caramel molasses and piloncillo hanging around peeking in occasionally and closes with cocoa coffee and ethanol mouthfeel: full silky smooth medium carbonation and a smooth finish with a slight robust edge overall: this is outstanding stuff. i’ve only had this beer a few times in my craft beer experience and i forgot just how well-made and tasty it is especially for such a big beer. coffee dark chocolate roast earthiness malt sweetness and alcohol come together in harmony to make this tasty libation and glad to have the chance to try it again. recommended
5587,Speedway Stout,4.22,poured from a 16 oz can dated 12/06/2022 into a willi becher pint glass. l - pours a dark brown almost black with a small tan head that dissipates slowly leaving a nice ring around the glass. s - smells of coffee and chocolate. t - tastes matches the smell lots of coffee and chocolate. f - full bodied with carbonation on the lighter side. o - very tasty stout.
5588,Speedway Stout,4.09,smallish beige dense head. slow to recede but eventually becomes a film of fine bubbles. streaky lacing after each sip. the color is nearly black--no light passes.  strong mocha aroma with light alcohol and just a touch of chalk. some fine background subsequent smells lean more toward the chocolate than the coffee.  the taste reminds me of powdered unsweetened cocoa. the body is full but not oily despite the high abv of 12%. this is enhanced with a lower carbonation level. the taste becomes more bitter with a coffee ground flavor coming through in the swallow. long bitter bakers chocolate aftertaste.
5589,Speedway Stout,4.49,purchased at bound beverage warrington pa. $16.50/4pk (16oz cans)  pours a welcoming dark dark brown/nearly black color. a one finger dense beige colored head that fades to a ring around the glass.  aromas of sweet chocolate and roasted malts.  a delicious mix of sweet chocolate coffee caramel-like toffee and deep roasted malts. all the flavors meld together for a nearly perfect imperial stout. the 12% abv is well hidden but you’ll need to respect it and take your time sipping this brew.  a creamy heavier consistency. low to moderate carbonation. leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.  overall an excellent stout. i’d love to try this aged in bourban barrels. highly recommended…cheers!
5590,Speedway Stout,4.66,poured from a pint can with into a tulip glass.  appearance: very dark brown — approaching black — with a 1 1/2”dark tan head that lingered and left nice lacing.  nose: dark roast coffee a little chocolate.  mouthfeel: heavy perfect for a beer of this horsepower.  attack: omigoodness — dark roast following the nose; coffee toffee chocolate.  finish: alcohol roast bitterness to balance the attack.  this is the epitome of an imperial stout. totally deserves its world-class rating. so well balanced! flavorful drinkable though i enjoy it as a sipper. there’s no beer i’d rather pair with a rich chocolate dessert though today it’s doing just fine with mixed lightly salted nuts.
5591,Speedway Stout,3.94,this is an abv bomb at 12%. the look in a glass is quite lovely with a dark body and (thin) head. the smell is of strong coffee together with an almost bourbon or rye smell most likely due to the high alcohol level. the taste is strong and close to syrupy. this is more of a desert beer and indeed i took my time sipping this one. i prefer lower abv beers than this one but for the style it is a solid effort.
5592,Speedway Stout,4.35,poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.  l- pitch black.  s- coffee aroma but not overpowering.  t- tannic coffee flavor complemented by a nice roasted malt flavor with a hint of cocoa.  f- full bodied mouthfeel.  o - an absolutely fantastic imperial stout.
5593,Speedway Stout,4.25,higher gravity beervent calendar 2022 day 18
5594,Speedway Stout,4.26,received in a proxy/trade hybrid from @turkeysdrinkbeer in february 2022. drunk in november of that year.  l: a very thin caramel-coloured head sits atop an inky black glass of thick-looking dead-still beer. no light penetrates the veil and no carbonation is visible.  s: the nose has roasted chocolate and coffee beans. rich gooey toffee sits beneath.  t: the first thing to note is the absolute lack of booze on the palate. theres none present on the way down and no sting on the tongue. i suspect this beer hides its weapons in plain sight. i dont see them yet and i dont feel them now but when they kick in im going to wonder what hit me.  tastewise theres coffee but its quite subtle. theres a layer of milky chocolate and as i always perceive in stouts these days a raspberry and cola note. theres some residual sweetness after the swallow that stops me from crushing what would otherwise be a reasonably quick-drinking beer.  the ability of this beer to hide its 12% gives it extra marks.  m: the beer is smooth and oily on the mouth but theres the slightest thinness that i think comes from the lack of booze in the flavour.  o: with mouthfeel being the only knock on this beer its an extremely enjoyable drink. the sweetness never gets cloying and the booze never gets uncomfortable. i wouldnt want more than one but thats ok in the case of this beer as id regret two of these the next day!  cheers! #147
5595,Speedway Stout,4.54,notes from 6/19/2022. poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. the beer is jet black with a small head that quickly dissipates to a thin cap. the intensity of aroma is medium. the aroma has dark chocolate strong cold brewed coffee and maybe a hint of cinnamon. theres a slight sweetness in the aroma. the intensity of taste is high. the flavor has strong dark coffee and dark chocolate that are so well balanced that they quickly fluctuate. the underlying maltiness is sweet the hops are spicy and are both in balance with the coffee and chocolate flavors. the thickness is well thick. its a little slick very creamy and the astringency is medium and in balance with the carbonation which is slightly above low. overall the balance of flavors and the balance of elements in the mouth feel is masterful. i like that the intensity of aroma is moderate and it made me unprepared for how very strong the flavor is. its a world class imperial stout that i anticipate getting again.
5596,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.63,bottle kindly shared by gunnar. abv is 9.5%. pitch black colour creamy brown head. intense aroma of chocolate and espresso coffee also liquorice and oak. the flavour is oaky and roasty with loads of chocolate without being too sweet. also notes of liquorice and espresso coffee. well balanced an excellent beer!
5597,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.59,dark w/ creamy thick tan head. nice lacing. fabulous aroma. coffee strong. taste is strong coffee and a hint of sweetness. smooth and easy to drink. overall a nice strong beer that will satisfy any craft beer drinker. on draft at ron’s corner tavern.
5598,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.25,bottle review.  pitch black; no light shall pass.  nice dark tan head; thick lacing.  smells of a delicious mocha latte; hint of booze. enticing.  thick heavy mouthfeel.  dark chocolate slaps you in the mouth on the first sip; coffee hits you on the back end.  this feels and tastes like a delicious chocolate malt. one of a kind.
5599,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.5,still love this beer. first had in 2016 from the bottle (4.75*) then in 2017 (4.5*) then a 2016 in 2018 (3.75*). maybe my palette has changed over the years resulting in the lowered rating or maybe its me aging the beer but its still one of my old favorites that ill continue to buy.
5600,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.29,on tap. pours a satin black with a multi finger tan head that lingers and leaves lacing. nose of espresso and roasted malt. taste follows nose with roasted malt strong coffee and a subtle not of chocolate to balance the roastiness. full body and low carbonation that is absolutely velvety smooth. another great yeti. great divide does these magnificently.
5601,Smoked Porter,3.99,pours a dark brown with some red highlights a thin tan head and no lacing. smells of roasted malts chocolate caramel a bit of smoke and some nuttiness. taste follows the nose with additional notes of dark fruits and a nice hop presence. expected far more smokiness seems more like a porter. medium bodied light side of medium carbonation smooth mouth feel.
5602,Smoked Porter,4.13,from a bottle brewed 12/27/15. dark brown color with a thin layer of brown head. roasted malt and vanilla smell. feels a little thin. roasted malt and smoke with some hop bitterness on the finish. great flavor wish the feel was a little bit heavier.
5603,Smoked Porter,3.92,from notes 4/2/12: pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light. the pour produces a frothy tan short-lived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing. aroma is dark roast dark fruit chocolate a little cherry and smoke. taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste. the level of smoke is a little disappointing. the taste is well balanced. mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with nice carbonation smooth and very drinkable.
5604,Smoked Porter,4,not as smoke forward as i like but still an undeniably good beer. its a bit more on the traditional porter side with a nice hop bite caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma. theres a light kiss of smoke but it makes you work for it. unfortunately although a good beer when reaching for a smoky fix i go for ofallons smoked porter yazoo sue or aecht schlenkerla rauchbier urbock.
5605,Rouge (Red),3.79,poured from a 330ml bottle .  pours deep brown  thickly milky with a mocha head that leaves moderate lacing . the smell is subtle  very yeasty and earthy and the taste follows on from this  the subtly surprising me as i expected it to become robust  its still richly yeasty with hints of burnt caramel wood  minerals and plum with a pleasant bitterness  the flavour sweetening as it warms . the mouthfeel is voluptuous. overall its heavy in a good way  rich but subtle in flavour. i prefer westmalle dubbel which matches this in style closely but id not say no to this at all . if i have this again i think ill let it warm a while after pouring to begin tasting it  i like the sweetness and fruitiness that come as it warms .
5606,Rouge (Red),4.25,330ml bottle - pours copper brown with 2 finger foamy white head. pleasant on the nose with fruity notes and bready malt. tastes of sweet dried fruit banana with a touch of malt and a gentle hop bitterness. goes down very easy and it makes for an enjoyable beer.
5607,Rouge (Red),4,8/6/23 poured from 33cl bottle purchased from the washington beer store in washington pa.  this is our first chimay!  poured a copper cloudy with beautiful off-white head.  aromas of brown bread stone with leah getting some apricot. typical belgian nose profile as well. green banana.  flavors of metallic brown bread. green banana as well. roasty malt forward. a sharp bitter brown sugar finish. the bitterness reminding me of licorice a bit.  thinner than i was expecting in the mouth feel.  cheers to our first chimay!
5608,Rouge (Red),4.31,l: chestnut brown body with a sudsy off white head. good retention.  s: dark fruits brown bread raisin belgian yeast  t: brown bread banana raisin toffee candi sugar light hops  f: medium bodied sticky and dry finish  o: classic example of the style and one of the best you can get!
5609,Rouge (Red),5,poured into my chimay glass.  appearance: beautiful amber color with a nice creamy head.  nose: very fruity especially dark fruits.  taste: taste follows the nose delicious dark fruits with plum. the finish has a nice light banana taste to it with a medium mouth feel.  overall: this is an excellent abbey ale! father theodore isolated the special strand of yeast used in this fantastic brew and this abbey ale tastes exquisite!! it`s quite expensive so when i savor this beer i do so on special occasions. enjoy cheers!!
5610,Rouge (Red),4.46,light copper with a 2 light tan head which lasts. heavy lacing.  aroma of belgian yeast fruits cinnamon.  taste is belgian yeast spices fruits caramel toffee.  medium body light carbonation. spicy dry finish.  a very nice belgian ale.
5611,Rouge (Red),4.41,330ml. bottle in the beer house vientiane laos. pours a cloudy copper colour. aroma of fruit yeast and hops. slightly acidic. spicy and fairly well carbonated. a bitter finish but the balanced flavours make this an excellent choice.
5612,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.19,(375 ml bottle 2015 vintage; purchased off shelf at state line yesterday though id seen it on the shelf there for years... decanted into my sapwood wine glass)  l: clear ruby-colored liquid with vinous-violet highlights; little pop on the cork removal little foam build on pour... the foam breaks down quick leaving little collar; almost looks still  s: cherry hard candy perfumy aromatics but not suggesting sweetness; that mixed with a barrel-funky champagne tone... fruit leather earthy rain-soaked terrain hint of fruit tart (pastry dough) fringe of smoky phenolics  t: mmm much fruitier than the aromas let on cherry and red grape some dark plum as well lingering dried red fruit in the dry aftertaste much more malt depth as well... the fruit portion of this is relatively bloated leaving the dying vitality of the lambic a touch buried; the expressions at this age are mature but still have character  f: nearly still as far as carbonation... smudgy light-medium body subtle acidic singe at the back of the palate... a sipper; too easy  o: this may have lost a good portion of its zest and zip but its still a lovely demure drop; basically drinks like an acidic near smoky moderately bright-fruity medium-bodied wine; lacking the boozy cut of a standard-strength vino... at this stage its still tasty but it doesnt compare to the standard mariage parfait in flavor impact and i had a 2014 bottle of that recently (2228)
5613,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.09,very good cherry flavored beer. drank in a teku glass. had no head on it whatsoever after pouring it. i wouldnt buy it again but i am glad i tried it as it was very enjoyable.
5614,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.18,375ml bottle into a teku. 2014 vintage.  looks good soft burgundy body. small head fizzes away quite quickly no lacing  tart cherry aroma with a hint of oak.  on tasting cherries much stronger than suggested by the nose. tart without being drying fairly sour a touch of wood.  mouth between medium and full finish tart cherry and at the very end a light dryness comes in.  overall very good kriek lambic holds up very well after 8 years.
5615,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,3.59,2015 vintage. pours a deep cherry red light pink 0.5 head that quickly settles out no lacing. nose is oak must wine lees cherry and cherry wood mild lactic notes. much of the fruit has sapped out of this over the years - there\s an initial hit of sourness at the start but tannic oak takes over rather quickly and sticks through to the finish. what is there of the fruit registers as sour cherry (i\d also buy raspberry) but it\s far in the background. feel is great - so very smooth and drinkable the only thing keeping me from drinking quarts of the stuff is price. would like to have fresh version to drink alongside to see how much the fruit is meant to shine.
5616,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.03,2011 vintage bottle. 2033 best before date so guessing this is a 2013 release.  pours a kind of deep purple with red hues. kind of in that coca cola/dr pepper meets dimetapp grape vein in color. that classic musty cherry character on the nose. even after all of this time its incredibly fruit forward. the cherry character is sweeter than i anticipated. having this im wanting to get some intense red some time soon. this has moderate levels of acidity and funk. overall its pleasant to drink but i feel like theres less lambic character than i would like.
5617,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.27,shared 375 ml bottle at local tasting vintage 2011. hazy deep red colour moderate pink head. lovely aroma of brettanomyces / farmhouse sour cherries crushed cherry kernels and almonds. sour cherries galore in the flavour tart finish. classy beer.
5618,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,3.88,first lambic . . . didnt really know what to expect. not as much head as expected. bottle was dated 2018. beautiful red as it poured . . . not nearly as sour as we heard possible.
5619,Cuvee De Tomme,4.55,a corked and caged 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz. bottle with no clear bottled on or best before date. poured into a tilquin stemmed glass.  appearance: it was a dark brownish red colour with a thin beige head that dissipated quickly while leaving only sparse to no lacing.  aroma: cherry vanilla blackcurrant oak graphite cabernet sauvignon.  taste: sour tart cherry blackcurrant blackberry vanilla oak with light notes of caramel chocolate and bourbon and a lightly acidic finish.  mouthfeel: medium to full bodied with soft carbonation.  overall: complex and enjoyable. loved the aroma while the taste was good but perhaps just a touch acidic.
5620,Cuvee De Tomme,4.24,750 ml bottle into a snifter. 2017 edition had 4/15/22.  pours a brownish ruby color semi opaque with no head and no lacing. aromas of cherry wine oak some chocolate light caramel. smells lightly sour. flavors are similar- cherry wine oak malt some chocolate light caramel. tastes fairly sour and lightly tart. smooth a solid medium body appropriately carbonated on the low side.  very enjoyable. lots of cherry more sour than expected after about five years didn’t pick up the bourbon barrels at all. based on the description above i would say that some of the flavors have become less distinct.
5621,Cuvee De Tomme,4.32,(5 oz pour in a little snifter at monks during pty day 20 feb)  l: light-chestnut brown color with tawny highlights; mild-moderate haze; no foam on the pour  s: tart cherry sour brown ale maltiness dark fruit and perfumy undertones... excellent intensity and depth  t: much of the aromas carry over onto the palate... the cherry is relatively prominent and is complimented beautifully by the wine barrel character (wood raisin)... tart up top lightly demerara-like malt underbelly  f: round and rolly but buoyant... served with a healthy charge of gas giving it more levity... a bit viscous on the edges but remaining soft on the palate despite some tartness causing a bit of pucker... could slug a mug  o: second time ever having this second time on draft at monks... love this liquid; 3-4 sips are not enough... why oh why have bottles never been out east?... gotta get one (2098)
5622,Cuvee De Tomme,4.34,2018 vintage at 12.5%
5623,Cuvee De Tomme,4.47,on tap at the brewery. incredible cherry character with added barrel qualities. such a great sour. rich and dark with the fruitiness that makes cherries so perfect for dark beers and aging. been waiting 15 years to try this and it does not disappoint!
5624,Cuvee De Tomme,4.22,bottle as the lost abbey cuvée de tomme kindly shared by gunnar. dark ruby colour large beige head. unusual and very complex aroma oaky and vinous notes sour cherries and farmhouse. sour flavour but not extreme the cherries are there but not totally dominant also oaky notes.
5625,Cuvee De Tomme,4.42,12.5%. poured from 750 ml bottle into snifter. a: pours a murky dark ruby amber/brown hue with no head. s: bourbon cherries vinous berries (cranberries strawberries and raspberries) a distinct wild yeast oak and a soft burnt caramel note. t: mouth-puckering tart cherries hits first quickly followed by warming spices and vinous berries as well as soft oak tannins subtle sweet bourbon and hints of nutty vanilla and elusive caramel. m: medium body. a burst of tart fruit followed by softer sweet elements. some warming aspects too. lingers and matures nicely on the palate. d: lovely and layered! take your time to sip savor and enjoy. let this open up a bit for best experience (seems to allow the stronger tart notes to better balance with the rest of the brew).
5626,4th Anniversary,4.52,2023 anniversary version - really good ipa - nice hope mix - excellent balance - next to no booziness for 10% (as is ohs way) - creamy with plenty of citrus backing - very solid.
5627,4th Anniversary,4.62,its a great triple. slightly nuanced hoppy tropical. satisfying mothfeel. hits all the marks for my palate.
5628,4th Anniversary,4.28,while i enjoyed the initial fruity aromas and flavors the finish was pithy and harsh. so i tried it again when they re-released it. this iteration is less boozy fosho; granted this definitely has some heat but it has a great body it’s well hopped and it’s pretty tasty.
5629,4th Anniversary,4.28,4th anniversary re-boot for 8th anniversary.
5630,4th Anniversary,4.09,cloudy orange with a fat finger of dense off-white foam head. good retention and thick lacing.  big pineapple aroma with tropical starburst dank jungle weed and mango beneath.  pineapple-forward taste as well coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish. there was fairly strong playdoh in there at first too; it might have been connected to the head because it faded after the first few sips.  full bodied with fairly zippy carbonation.  lots of fantastic elements in this. the playdoh was a huge let down at first but again that off-flavor didn’t last too long.
5631,Stille Nacht,4.29,served in a tulip glass from the bottle.  appearance: hazy brown colored body with a white head which comes off very foamy with an initial rise of over one fingers length off the body.  smell: bland aroma of caramel and malt. its almost the fermentation smell when you visit a brewery. not the most pleasant but the worst.  taste: complex toffee and vanilla with a mild cinnamon notes. very addicting taste. think of barley and honey meshed to with the above to make an addicting brew which is hard to keep down.  mouth: medium to strong carbonation. depends how long you let it sit for. softens a bit after you let it settle. sticky body which stays with you but not as super potent.  overall: a gem. could use tweaking but honestly why mess with something that is not broken. salud!
5632,Stille Nacht,4.31,2022 batch bottle. sampled out of season on may 20 2023.  attractive cloudy looking orange-amber appearance underneath a boisterous fluffy cream colored head that never quite dissipates. lacing and legs.  inviting aromas of belgian yeast dark bread crust banana grape nutmeg coriander and just a whiff of that 12% alcohol.  medium to full mouthfeel. soft and delightful.  sweet bread and belgiany taste with bread herbs and spices maybe brown sugar tannin and a warming alcohol bite that keeps it mildly dry at the finish. i am drinking it in may but this is something i would enjoy as much on a cold winter night.
5633,Stille Nacht,4.37,300ml bottle into a brugges glass. 2018 release so over 4 years old.  nice looking beer amber/yellow body with a persistent bright white head. sweet boozy aroma. tastes outstanding warming fairly sweet with a full mouthfeel.
5634,Stille Nacht,4.5,nice to be sampling this seasonal upon the appropriate season... uneventful cap pry pours a translucent limey-amber hue with effervescent capper which dissipates into a gurgling ring and mists upon surface slight but persistent carbonated bubbles abound... nose is of fruity esters and prominent yeasty-beasties... taste is indeed of tart apples bitter grapefruit as the hop presence asserts itself underscored by a certain not-domineering sweetness... swish of the tongue is complex bittersweet the rather potent abv jabbing along the gumline... swallow is largely dry and fizzy light but deep body and a bittersweet finish as it descends down the throat. id easily label this tripel-ish if under a blind taste test.  for a holiday ale i suppose i was expectant of a bit more sugar & spice but its quite a nice pairing with this winter chill.
5635,Stille Nacht,4.19,11.6oz bottle. no dating information found. cloudy deep gold colored body. it took three pours because of the rising head to empty the bottle. the white head rises and then coalesces to a thick cap and ring. aroma of green apple and coriander. expressive yeast. taste is a combination of flavors - dark fruit and green apple toasted malt and fruity hops (tangerine and lime). the malts hold the hops in the aftertaste. medium plus mouth feel. has a certain stickiness along with a sour cleansing bite). the head is forever very supportive carbonation. the brew balance allows for a open exploration of the nose and flavors - all of which are well expressed.
5636,Stille Nacht,4.22,bottled and purchased from beermoth from manchester city centre pours a warming if slightly hazy amber body with splatterings of white head aroma is candied peel flavour is candied peel
5637,Stille Nacht,4.18,2022 vintage. bottle to wine glass.  l: pours a murky brownish orange with a huge foamy head. plenty of very fine yeast sediment floating around.  s: apple spices a bit of cherry and some grassy notes.  t: green apple and white grapes paired with grassy herbal notes. malty and tart at the same time.  f: very juicy and rather light bodied. medium carbonation.  o: great christmas beer with a nice acidic twist. pretty much what you would expect from de dolle brouwers.
5638,Stille Nacht,4.12,look is retarded. gentle pour and im waiting hour for the head to dissipate. sorry not into it.  smell. nice. fruity esters and belgian yeast. whats not to like.  taste - fruity. everescent. quintessiential.  feel - vibrant. refreshing. crisp. bright.  overall - a very nice beer. apart from the frothy look of taking a piss in a creek i cant say anything bad about it.
5639,Stille Nacht,4.69,pours opaque dark gold in color with one quarter inch head. taste is big apples hay candied sugar and belgian spice. light bodied moderate carbonation slightly sweet. wow is this great. excellent combination of funk and sweet. so many layers of flavor. happy i picked this up.
5640,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.36,expedition stout bourbon barrel-aged from bell’s brewery. 12 oz bottle. stored at 34 degrees at home. received from @whyteboar in nbw bif #16. reviewed 17/12/22. note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. bottle marked on back label “shelf life – unlimited” also “pkg 11/17/2021). served at 53.8 degrees in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 57.3 degrees. appearance – 3. first pour – brown (srm 20) nearly opaque. body - ruby brown (srm 24) opaque. under direct light same. when rear lite opaque but some light penetrates the edges – ruby. head – small (maximum 0.7 cm aggressive center pour) camel high density quickly diminishing to a 0.15 cm crown with a thin partial cap. lacing – none. aroma – 4.5 – chocolate and bourbon edge out roasted malt as the dominant aromas no hops no yeast. flavor – 4.5 – flavor follows the nose – roasted malt slightly bitter no hops no yeast. no ethanol (13.4 % abv as marked on label) aroma or taste. marked gastric warming occurs. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. palate – 4.5 – medium creamy soft but lively carbonation. final impression and summation: 4.25 looks like used motor oil minus the sheen very average for a ris. the aromas and flavors duplicate each other and reinforce the sensory perceptions. the ethanol is totally hidden making this dangerously quaffable. damn good!
5641,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,pours pitch black with a finger of dark mocha head. aroma and taste giving off loads of roasted malt peat coffee grounds dark chocolate black cherry prune caramel molasses tobacco drying oak tannin significant bourbon nice amount of vanilla. low full body. oily sticky silky. a gigantic beer that doesnt disappoint. well done as expected.
5642,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.52,12oz bottle package date of 11/17/21. pours black with a very small sized brown head. smells of bourbon cocoa vanilla dark fruit dark roasted malt and earthy hops. the taste follows exactly. good intensity and balanced flavors. moderate bitterness and dryness in the finish. above average body and low carbonation. overall this is a great barrel aged ris; strong yet smooth and drinkable.
5643,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.38,many thanks to erland for sharing this one. pkgd 11/17/21. 13.4% abv 12oz bottle. pours out to a syrupy thick ink black forming a thick dark cocoa head with average retention sparse lacing. the nose is definitely full of bourbon but on top of that classic expedition nose we all love...prunes dark chocolate raisins figs soy sauce and black walnut. mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy dense bodied. medium light carbonation ~2.25 carbs or so. taste is a recap of the nose. the bourbon is well balanced with the other complex stuff going on here and gives it a more warming presence that traditional expedition. bitterness is mild and earthy hops are kept in check by copious malts. considering the rich complex malts there is no sourness or astringency here...this easily happens in lesser riss if the roasted malts are overdone. one is enough. its a heavy hitter and very rich. this might be great over dark chocolate ice cream. hrmmm. might have to try that.
5644,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,black in color with no light penetration. theres a fingernail of brown around the rim. the aroma is of piney hops and dark malt. im tasting piney hops and sweet bourbon. the mouth is thick and chewy.
5645,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.76,12oz bottle pkg 11/17/2021 13.4% abv i swear i’ve had this before…but no review (?) l: jet black body thin brown head s: bourbon barrel dark cocoa roast char caramel t: very oaky boozy bourbon dark chocolate roasted barley vanilla toasted coconut caramel earthy hops tobacco leaf leather f: full body sticky & smooth ample carbonation a boozy sipper with a dry finish o: i thought i had this one before but nothing seems familiar; either way it’s one i’ve always wanted to get my hands on and i guess i finally did! such a great beer!
5646,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,i have to say i liked this one much better once it warmed up. before it warmed up it there was a big chocolate taste with some barrel. after it warmed the other flavors started to pop. the chocolate faded a bit and vanilla and coffee flavors became more present. the barrel also came to the forefront. a bit thin but very good overall.
5647,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.65,pours a nice dark amber red with a bone colored head. smells of malt tastes very malty a muted bitterness at the start with an powerful rosin taste and dry feel the bitterness begins to bite after the fact. no alcohol hidden here. nice for what it is.
5648,Arrogant Bastard Ale,2.56,i mistakenly pick this ale up from a pick- six and realized that it wasn’t a ipa which i am use to drinking. needless to say not impressed at all the ale is overpowering with alcohol.
5649,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.55,look: pours a deep shade of amber with a generous three finger head of beige foam that has excellent retention and laces the glass very well. no visible carbonation.  aroma: sticky toffee and caramel bitter grapefruit peel spruce needles and toasted orange peel. a touch of sweet/funky guava.  taste: upfront treacle and sweet tamarind. quickly transitions into moderately bitter notes of flambéed orange and grapefruit peel. ends on rich notes of bitter tree resin and spicy spruce needles.  feel: full bodied and velvety. very low carbonation. silky smooth and creamy. alcoholic heat profile is very mild but somewhat detectable i wouldnt call it boozy but you can definitely tell its not a light weight beer.  overall: i\ve had this beer many many times but haven\t had it in a while. it\s much better than i remember. would highly recommend to anyone who likes their west coast ipas and hasn\t tried it yet or any veterans who may have not had it in a long time. definitely a world class imperial ipa / strong ale.
5650,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.72,poured in standard pint glass. nice ample fine sustained head. very bitter slightly boozy when straight from the fridge. did not enjoy had to walk away. allowed to warm slightly but still cool had a more pleasurable experience. prominent bitterness was accompanied by greater complexity of flavors including leather wet tobacco faint hint of dried fig. well-suited for a cool spring day post-yard work.  a beer i would prefer not to eat a meal with but rather enjoy on its own when in the mood for something strong and different. never got to enjoy the barrel version. with its name; likely a victim of its own success but as with a once fantastic bottle-conditioned bicycle beer it happens. at least this beer still retains its general character and is not simply concerned with appeasing the easy-drinking masses. still memorable for a first-timer. not a go-to by any means but will not hesitate to drink again on occasion.
5651,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.04,i hadnt seen this in a while picked up a six pk on sale. much more bitter / astringent than i remember.... will use the rest for beer bath bratwurst.
5652,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.04,pours dark amber with ample tan head. smells like toasty malts and bitter hops. the taste is brawny bitter toasty herbal with some citrus and fig perhaps. it’s kinda like a less fruity more bitter version of celebration bit i still like it and it’s pretty similar to what i remembered before cheers!
5653,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.75,quite bitter but thats to be expected i suppose. there is some balance with a nice maltiness but not enough balance for me i would prefer more malt flavor. fortunately for me the hops arent too dank or piney (which i dont enjoy) - just a little bitter grapefruit.
5654,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.25,poured into a tall clear pint glass. appearance is a mahogany color with a thick foamy beige head. good retention and lacing.  aroma: dark fruit caramel chocolate roasted malt roasted nuts.  taste: just like the aroma and very crisp and bitter which is a nice change from the typical lower ibu beers that ive had. other notes of grapefruit toffee and maybe even coffee. body is medium-light.
5655,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.27,compared to the original arrogant bastard this is a poor sequel. the original had a strong malt backbone to balance the bitterness. this incarnation has no malt to speak of. its just another beer substituting ibus for flavor.
5656,Swish,4.65,pale opaque orange with thin tan head. standard hazy look. smell is complex with pithy rind orange vanilla and malts. similar smell to some of the hill farmstead ipas. extremely bright taste with tons of tropical sweet notes however has a nice bitterness at the end. pleasing feel that doesnt linger too long. swish is a spectacular hazy that stands uniquely in a sea of copy cats.
5657,Swish,4.59,bissell brothers is the larry bird/magic johnson of breweries to me. not a knock at all but my mj is the alchemist. that being said the swish drops in to my stomach like a steph curry logo 3 point shot. nothing but net all swish. beautiful laker gold color. completely opaque with a slight bubbly froth. on the nose you get phoenix suns orange with some miami heat tropical pineapple notes. was expecting a thick shaq like body but it’s a more lean medium body reminiscent of a dwight howard. taste wise you get the traditional ipa bitter hop bite that gives a slight celtics green herby taste. however it also has that new wave neipa melon cream citrus fruit flavor. the neipa is the new dynasty the golden state warriors of the beer industry. what an absolute treat go nuggets.
5658,Swish,4.62,(16 oz can 011073 04-17-23; purchased cold 4-pk at the brewery 2 days ago... poured into my trillium fat tulip)  l: impenetrably-hazy pale yellow-amber liquid with mildly golden highlights on the fringes... moderately tall foam rise on the pour sinking back into a misty cap... bit of a letdown from the lame head retention and little lacing  s: lime hull lemon peel mango funk grapefruit pith; slight capsicum spicy accent... cream of wheat... vibrant greenness cutting through the perfumy fruits... the booze does boost the contact and seduction  t: much more malt and mush than id anticipated and its great!; floral rush halfway morphing into a tropical cleaver into the finish during which a powdery grain flour note swells up and hangs up front long into the aftertaste... almost halfway through and wow! did the tropical hopping burst back onto my palate fresh and enlivening... masterpiece of balance for its ilk  f: only a faint sense of alcohol at the back of the palate; the milky grains and silky hop resins team to tame the heat i suppose... i wouldnt go any higher with the abv for this style; 7.5% is usually my sweet spot and this is just tickling the tonsils just inching toward unnecessary noxious-ity  o: not a fan of hazies but this shot right up into my top 3 or 4; they really do have a good thing going as ive very much enjoyed the unique character of each brand ive tried from them... i could definitely see getting this again (good excuse for another beer run to maine); it has a lot going on for the style; some depth and dimension to the gritty grain bill; too smooth and moreish (2122)
5659,Swish,4.41,pours a very hazy gold with a thumb of cream colored head. average head retention & lacing; thought i had a clean glass???  s: citrus & tropical fruits nice nose  t: oranges dryness mangoes dryness & green melons & strawberry up front. mangoes peaches green melon & a little acidic pineapple plus a little dryness as this beer warms finishes a little dry with plenty of pineapple green melon & strawberry  mf: medium body restrained carbonation nicely balanced acidity on the tongue  a brilliant take on the style pretty juicy
5660,Swish,4.74,on tap at mekong in rva. hazy darker gold with a proper head. huge citrus and bright tropical fruit juices with a slightly floral aroma. big balanced grapefruit and other citrus which is tamed and balanced. super juicy and refreshing feel. majestic ipa.
5661,Swish,4.25,on tap pours a moderately hazy orange. taste is dominated by a bright berry flavor assuming thats from the mosaic. solid neipa but not the standout its rating would suggest.
5662,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.22,l: classic orange super hazy medium white head s: fresh mango and pineapple white grape juice tropical fruit t: orange and grapefruit peel orange some mango vegetal hop pine bitterness dry o: very good lighter bodied neipa taste is less tropical/juicy than expected and more dry and resinous
5663,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.58,likely the best pale ale ive ever had. just hits every note - perfect balance ton of flavor. if i could have this in my beer fridge at all times i would. it just curb stomps the vast majority of pale ales ive had. great citrus flavors nice body. surprising high abv for a pale which probably helps the flavor profile but im not taking that as a detraction - this is a fantastic beverage.
5664,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.43,deep orange in color. no head created at all. nose was the least desirable quality mainly due to not much there especially given the color and extreme citrus taste. taste is the magical moment. superb beer. surprised it is not considered a ne style though.
5665,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.31,2022-03-06 16oz can served in a stemless wineglass. dated 01/25/22. received from @wunderllama in nbs bif #14.  pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. smell...well for starters i been catching whiffs of it for where i set it arms length away (and i have long arms). smell is gorgeously tropical juicy pineapple/mango/orange. lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff.  taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. its bitter up front lots of resin and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.  mouthfeel is medium bodied dry / drying slightly gritty. this is a very good beer.
5666,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.49,one month old. can to wine glass.  look: pours a pale but somehow full and hazy yellow with a large-pored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing. no floaters.  smell: fresh citrus notes. mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit.  taste: yellow citrus fruits. fresh and hoppy. zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. low sweetness.  feel: very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch.  overall: full and juicy pale ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits. could easily be mistaken for a dipa. very challenging compared to other pale ales with its full body and its dry finish. great beer. very intense.
5667,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.23,330ml bottle from beers of europe (£2.69): chestnut brown with a half cm bubbly head that settles as a thin & patchy surface lacing. rich & complex smelling theres a sweet malt base with darker fruits on top; prunes figs & dates with some sugars & faint toffee. the taste is similarly sweet with a malty backbone a slightly effervescent feel that has the prunes & figs from the nose alongside the toffee & bread malts & caramel with sugars a hint of spice & yeast to finish. its rich balanced & well-carbonated with a good balance between the malts & the darker fruit sweetness & most of the alcohol hidden too.
5668,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.12,l- deep chestnut and has poured beyond hazy this has small chunks floating around despite the bottle being rested for days and poured reeeally slowly - so it seems pretty major sediment is inevitable/by design. pours with 5mm off white head half of which still exists when i finish the glass 15mins later. s- milder than anticipated some caramel and a sense of richness. i thought i got a hint of mild/sour cherry on an early sniff but never managed to get it again. t- there is a small dose of sourness on the front here then the flavour opens out immediately - boom! its big pungent and deep. it has a sweet note (in parallel with its overall richness) something i rarely favour but here its balanced by the sour. its deep well-roasted pungency make this a super winter-warmer type of beer. ps late on i suddenly get a hang on is that a blackcurrent note coming in!?... maybe fleeting. f- its quite a mouthful pungent intense more suited to colder months as a slow-sippin winter warmer beer. all rather wonderful. o- i think this is absolutely superb. how they balance the sweet + sour is very clever its so fine-tuned. overall the whole hangs together really well; there isnt anything at all that i note thats wrong or out of balance. updated lable on bottle: now entirely modern almost a bit urban/gritty a stencil/graffiti design in white black and purple. bought from beers of europe (uk) 330ml bb: 29/08/2021
5669,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.08,bottle at coriassos served in a trappist glass. pours a brown colour with red tones to the light medium head with short retention crying lace. aroma of prunes coffee caramel chocolate i think i feel some notes of tobacco spices. full body thick in the tongue good carbonation. sweet finish. taste follows the aroma. very good one.
5670,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.59,brown to yellow colours lots of carbonation fair amount of sweetness and candy like tastes. i like it
5671,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.21,pours a murky chestnut color with some red hints with a medium top of beige head that dissolves slowly. aroma is pleasant with notes of dark and dried fruits like plums raisinsprunes figues caramelbread dark malts red berriesspices and smoked woods. the taste is sweet with notes dried fruits and with a strong malt profile in the background. i sense hints of caramel bread in the flavour as well. the finish is slightly dry still with the malt profile strong in the background. great strenght and lenght in the aftertaste. the flavours are balanced very well and the alcohol content hidden very good. mouthfeel is silky and oily with a medium carbonation and a medium body. a very nice example of a belgian strong dark ale. very enjoyable.
5672,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.34,purchased in march 2018750ml bottle for $6.20 from the lcbo. -- great deal . bottled dec. 2017--one year old. poured into westmalle chalice at 11c. nice cola head no lacing. kinda boozy but in a nice way goes very well with chocolate mint candy.
5673,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],3.84,we have a live one! careful when opening very active. this is going to sound gross but trust me it is not: the taste is prunes and raisins combined with cola and yeast. like i said trust me the taste is very enjoyable though admittedly not the most deep. in fact the depth is a little short in the nose too and especially in the body. want more because what they have is good
5674,Zenne Y Frontera,4.6,18/19 blend 93.
5675,Zenne Y Frontera,4.31,blend n94 season 18/19. drank 02.02.23 out of a hill farmstead oversized wine glass.  look - no head and little carb gold color. smell - distinctly lambic. taste - acid. too much at cellar temp but when it got to room temp it was more tasty but still too much on the sour side for my taste. feel - medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. overall - just too sour and acidly of a lambic for me to really enjoy; i need to give another blend another shot just to see if it was this batch or if zenne might not be my thing.
5676,Zenne Y Frontera,4.77,a: pours crystal clear dark golden yellow almost amber small fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. 4.25  s: aroma is tart lactic acidity a big minerality some plastic like funk notes only the faintest barnyard characters. mild sherry notes give it a subtle fruitiness. a bit of spice on the finish like white pepper. 4.75  t: taste is immediately wildly complex. there’s a sweetness up front followed by a sour tart punch then lingering oaky vanilla on the finish that lasts forever. it’s not as aggressively tart as some lambics/gueuzes likely subdued by the cask asking. other characters i get are red grapes tart citrus moderate spice. just fantastic so much going on and the finish is divine. 5  m/d: mouthfeel is medium bodied. carbonation lower than most in the style but insanely drinkable. 4.25  o: a gem of a beer. well worth the hype. an elite beer. 4.75
5677,Saunter,4.41,rich roasty toasty and quaffable as hell. this is a top of the line session brew. incredible malt flavors of dark chocolate and dark crusted pretzel. a light herbal hop character accents everything very nicely. seriously huge flavors for such a low abv beer. highly recommended.
5678,Saunter,4.04,can cherry-amber with sticky frothy steady taupe head; carob medium roast coffee + dark candy sugar on the nose; rock candy mochaccino some autumn leaves hazelnut skin and light buzz of winter spice; creamy low carb lt-med.  4.25 4 4 4.25 4  i love milds and this is not a great one but thats not an insult + let me say why: its the milk chocolaty (not vinous) + especially crystal end of the dark mild scale - much more baby strong ale than baby porter or baby old ale. and its a bit too far that end: the maltiness ends up candy sweet and that just wont do in a style designed for pint after pint. add that its not earning its 4.2% (when it could/should be 3.6%) and then *lactose*... yeah this fails for a purist. but take a moment to notice all the things this does right for a style that seems elusive to american breweries: the dextrinous body the restrained carbonation the well-judged hop bitterness the lighter layering of malt.  like a talented actor miscast this almost powers through by sheer skill of execution.  sfb on a bad day is still far better than most.
5679,Saunter,4.18,appearance - the beer poured a brownish-black with an off-white head.  smell - the beer had a nice dry ale nose with malts and mild bitterness.  taste - the initial taste had baker’s chocolate with mild bitterness. there was a touch of sweetness with hints of coffee in the malts. mild hops came through at the finish.  mouthfeel - the finish was smooth with small carbonation and a medium body.  overall -the beer was super refreshing. it would work great with a fish fry.
5680,Saunter,4.52,poured from a can (30sep2020) into a 25cl suarez stein  l: pours a very clear dark caramel/amber with a moderate off-white head. fades somewhat but there’s a decent head sticking around after 5+ minutes. bit that’s faded leaves some nice lacing as does each sip. no visible carbonation  s: excellent slightly sweet and roasty nose. get toffee roast coffee some very rustic whole grain bread this bit of honey sweetness  t: follows the nose well impressively full flavored while being quite light. get toffee and that medium/light roast coffee from the nose a bit of that honey sweetness as well. some sort of grainy/rustic bread note as well toward the middle/finish  f: medium body light+ carbonation has a bit of a fuller feel which may be the lactose or maybe i’m forcing it  o: just a delicious beer. full of flavor and far from watery easy drinking love it
5681,Saunter,4.52,can courtesy of bigklip74.
5682,Saunter,4.18,look - purchased at the brewery and poured into a standard pint glass. dark amber in color transparent and small frothy head with trace lacing. smell - a ton of roasted malts and some coffee with a honey-like sweetness. taste - mostly roasted malts with a hint of black-coffee like bitterness and light smokiness towards the end. finish is smooth with the fragrance of the roasted malts lasting for quite some time. feel - medium bodied high carbonation and fairly low abv at 4.2%. overall - its hard to find a bad beer at suarez. another beer that is a quintessential representation of its style.
5683,Saunter,3.82,appearance: looks like brown ale with very minimal head. no sediment or floaties.  smell: light biscuity malt with a floral sweetness and a little honey.  taste: very mild. whole-grain biscuity malt with little caramel sweetness and light coffee with just a faint of creamer. also a little cola taste in the backend.  mouthfeel: very light bodied smooth.  overall: a really solid beer during the autumnal months and a nice break from the more popular beer styles in todays society!
5684,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,2018 vintage; consumed on 5/22/2023  pours a jet-mahogany body topped with two fingers of fluffy khaki-hued foam; good head retention leaves a spotty paper-thin cap large creamy collar and a modest array of chunky webby lacing strewn around the walls of the glass.  aromas open to fresh prune laden with prickly oak as accents of fig wash through an encroaching bourbon undercurrent sporting progressive dark cocoa and edgy vanillins detailing.  taste brings saucy prune and stewed dates upfront with notes of dusty cocoa and charry oak encroaching on werthers originals past the mid-palate into smoked toffee meeting distant undertones of burnt vanilla on the back end of the profile.  mouthfeel offers a medium-light body and a robust fluff of moderate carbonation dispersing an airy char to a steadily cleaning roast washing over the mid-palate a quiet warmth trailing into a bright twang integrating effortlessly toward the finish.  a daring fusion of barrel and brightness in a profile saturated with near-syrupy dark fruit reductions and a tempering deft level of cocoa char; an exceedingly bold almost authoritative expression of the style executed with adept clarity.
5685,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.67,1910 name: 4th dementia brewery: kuhnhenn brewing location: warren mi style: old ale abv: 13.5% date: 2022 next on the review desk is fourth dementia from kuhnhenn brewing. i am going to start to pull some big ones from the cellar. this beer has been on my want list for over eight years. many beers on my want list like fox farms require travel. i am excited to get to this review. using a tulip i served this beer at around 50 degrees. the pour created an airy fingered light brown head with no retention. it came and went faster than life. no lacing was left on the glass. the high alcohol content could cause the head to wane. i was charting the color somewhere around srm 32 dark rusty brown. the appearance is about average for this style. nosing the glass i smell whiskey oak caramel toffee chocolate soy sauce mild coffee bread raisins smokiness maillard vanilla char and tobacco. the first sip is like a perfectly executed tango on my palate with flavor. i taste whiskey oak caramel toffee chocolate soy sauce mild coffee bready raisins figs vanilla maillard tobacco char dark roasted malts burnt sugar and an aged wine note. the mouthfeel is slightly warm and coating finishing smooth and long. this beer is smacking. the wait was worth it; everything about this beer is terrific. the barrel age is near perfect. the warmer the beer gets the more flavors develop creating this symphony in your mouth. stellar beer; i wish i had several more to sip on.
5686,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.57,2022 vintage  i knew downloading tavour would be a good idea and i am very grateful that it allows me to access this long time want of mine. i’ve only had one other kuhnhenn beer before the best in style raspberry eisbock that i enjoyed very much. this one is yet another highly regarded style topper. let’s dig in  pours an opaque dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  wow this is huge in the nose. super malty and bourbon forward. i’m picking up on aromas of brown bread toasted walnut sweet bourbon dates smooth oak sticky caramel raisin brown sugar smoky tobacco light aged hops and sweet red wine  it doesn’t reach the same levels of intensity in taste but it is still very good. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting brown sugar dark bread raisin black cherry sweet bourbon caramel smooth oak light vanilla and old leather. the swallow brings notes of brown bread molasses toasted walnut brown sugar sweet bourbon burnt caramel toasted oak port wine smoky tobacco and light sherry  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer. finishes off dry with just a touch of booze feeling well before 13.5%  this is absolutely awesome! i’m so happy i finally got the chance to try it and even happier i have 3 more bottles of this to drink
5687,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.9,#160 excellent!
5688,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,pours dark brown with a tan head. tobacco bourbon barrel that is actually dark wood forward by a tiny bit toffee prune old ale yeast nose. taste hits barrel and barley first with tobacco leather prune then toffee plum skin black licorice and then a finishing oxidized yeast finish. feel is boozy yet cooler medium bodied and artful yeast with great barrel character. let this warm up and it will reward you!
5689,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,12oz bottle from tavour. mahogany pour ring of head. aroma is raisins plums sweet woody. taste is pit fruit light tannic notes tobacco prunes woody barrel sweetness. slick body abv seeps in slowly. luscious sumptuous.
5690,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,5,04/04/23 bottle @ home
5691,Fundamental Observation,4.71,pours a deep dark brown color. aroma is a wonderful combination of rich chocolate deep vanilla with hints of bourbon and dark fruits. taste is really intense combination following nose -- dark chocolate strong vanilla fruity and bourbon flavors. mouthfeel is full bodied. overall incredible stout.
5692,Fundamental Observation,4.44,2022 vintage (batch 8) served in my bruery snifter. pours one shade shy of black. complexion is opaque. head ins loose and mocha-colored and quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders and an oily slick across the surface. nose is decadent vanilla caramel cocoa and spirits. this is going to be decadently sweet! taste follows nose - spirits are subdued and only come out at the finish. the rest is just pure candy. mouthfeel is medium in body with a semi-still carbonation. overall an amazing imperial stout.
5693,Fundamental Observation,4.54,500ml capped bottle into a bbt snifter.  pours with a 1 finger dark mocha head. beer pours heavy pitch black viscous. sticky mocha legs. nose is chocolate vanilla molasses and barrel. pungent and rich. beer opens chocolate vanilla and fudge. hints of cocoa powder and roasted malt. big barrel overtones. more vanilla and molasses in the finish. body is full with low carbonation. sticky and viscous on the palate and goes down warm with a long lingering sticky aftertaste.  this is great. simple but well made. amazing body.
5694,Fundamental Observation,4.89,one of my favorites from bl... i only had b1 a few years ago but im catching up on my reviews.
5695,Fundamental Observation,4.68,received from a generous person in a nbs bif back in 2020 and split with a friend soon thereafter. this is from the notes. pours the color of strong coffee (stout black i like to call it) and is light blocking dark in the glass with just a little walnut hue on the edges. the deep brown head is inviting and slow to dissipate. the aroma gave me vanilla first bourbon second and the menagerie of dark fruits chocolate coffee wood char that make up the malts contribution to the smells. very nice if a little more vanilla than expected. the taste was solid. the vanilla so heavily featured in the aroma was first on the tongue followed and overwhelmed my the coffee-chocolate-dark fruits almost cake like in effect; not sweet exactly just decadent (if that makes any sense) the bourbon was in the swallow terminating the pastry party effectively. the feel was a viscous pleasure. for such an abv i like something with heft or body - to sip and savor not quaff down like some aal. this nicely fits my preferences almost perfectly. would love to try again but glad i got to try it at least once.
5696,Fundamental Observation,4.23,received from the ever-generous @turkeysdrinkbeer in august 2022 and drunk in may 2023.  l: thick jet black. utterly still. theres a thin coat of rusty coppered-coloured foam atop the glass.  s: umami roastiness booze vanilla dark chocolate cocoa and ethereal spirit notes from the bourbon. surprisingly this didnt change much as the beer warmed.  t: vanilla and bourbon notes dominate the initial swallow and then a wave of booze crashes over the top burning throat tongue and larynx like a good ris should. theres a tangy hit of malt and then a retronasal whack of cookie dough settles in and lingers long. warmth settles in the stomach and a medicinal sweetness slides in after the cookie dough fades. theres an excellent balance to this beer - theres no danger of cloying sweetness nor is there so much stickiness that wasps begin to hover expectantly around my head.  m: mouthfeel is thick and unctuous - theres minimal carbonation but it suits the beer well. as noted above theres warmth seeping lazily through my body at the halfway mark of this one and it settles deep and comfortably like an old familiar couch.  o: this is an enjoyable but intense beer experience. theres no likelihood of a second beer after youve spent an hour or so in the company of this beer but the size of this beer means thats not a problem.  cheers! #242
5697,Fundamental Observation,4.75,a real sweet treat. it’s like a piece of portillo’s chocolate cake soaked in some tasty bourbon and then poured into a glass. plenty of vanilla presence too. full bodied big bold boozy and in no way overly thick oily or cloying. a nice slow sipper because it really improves and opens up as it sits in the glass for a few hours.
5698,Fundamental Observation,3.98,previous review somehow deleted but from memory hit notes reminiscent of other chocolate-heavy. fudgey and dense stouts. vanilla wasnt too prominent while mouthfeel had some light carbonation and was surprisingly moderate.
5699,Fundamental Observation,4.73,appearance: fundamental observation has a deep dark brown color with a creamy tan head that dissipates slowly. the beer is opaque and has good clarity.  aroma: the aroma is rich and complex with notes of dark chocolate roasted coffee dark fruit (figs raisins) and a hint of smokiness. there is also a distinct hop character that adds to the overall aroma profile.  taste: the flavor is full-bodied and robust with a rich creamy mouthfeel. the dark chocolate and coffee notes are prominent with hints of dark fruit toasted nuts and smokiness. the hop character adds a pleasant bitterness to the finish.  mouthfeel: the mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a moderate carbonation that adds a nice effervescence. the beer is full-bodied and has a long finish that lingers on the tongue.  overall impressions: fundamental observation is a well-crafted complex beer with a rich flavor profile. the aroma and taste are well-balanced and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. this beer is a great choice for those who enjoy dark rich and full-bodied stouts.
5700,Fundamental Observation,4.23,i had both the 2018 and 2019 vintage. this review is for the 2019 vintage. the 2019 is not substantially different (going off memory) although i think the body (mouthfeel) is a little thicker.  surprisingly at 3 years this beer hasnt lost much (any?) vanilla although refrigerated most of that time.  the best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell. the nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing - with a hint of something else. perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract. the taste is similar but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for. its the essence but not direct flavor. lots of deep fudgy chocolate. a bit of alcohol on the back end which is unusual but i suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla. while tasty i wouldnt say that the taste is complex.  nothing exceptional about this beer but it is very good. i think that my score accurately reflects how i feel about this beer and what i think it is deserving of.
5701,Gold Stock Ale,4.71,i\m rating this from a can today but having had it a bunch on tap i\ll point out that this is a little different - the wood is firmer here and masks some of the hop character at the front. i don\t know why this is classed as an english ipa. it\s really what the pale ale category should include. maybe there\s too much hop character? anyway pours a beautiful golden amber color - has that classic nebco hoppy nose. sweet piney floral juicy character. and the taste follows though this batch 1/10/2022 give or take carries just a load more wood in it. anyway deserving of #1 here albeit perhaps not a classic english ipa it\s great whatever you choose to call it!
5702,Gold Stock Ale,4.1,on tap at new england brewing co in new haven ct.  this one pours a clear golden yellow color with a small white head and lots of lacing.  this smells like piney hops cedar golden maltiness tea and grassy hops.  ive randomly wanted to try this one for a while now and its pretty nice stuff. dry hopping with german hops give this a unique and separate character from a typical west coast or ne-style ipa for sure and thats intriguing to me. i get tea grassiness lemon and maybe even lime - along with some more typical grapefruit. theres a bit of maltiness but its sort of welcome here - its a golden biscuity type of flavor and just a light bit of sweetness.  this is crisp and dry with delicious smoothness on the back end. its quite drinkable.  id certainly love to see more ipa takes that arent just northeast juice bombs. the uniqueness wins me over here.
5703,Gold Stock Ale,3.78,a: slight haze; deep gold in color; 1 finger finely pored ivory head that receded to a thin cap; little lacing;  s: not especially aromatic; whats there is grassy and earthy;  t: follows the nose with a touch of lemon in the background; mild to moderate bitterness at the end;  m: medium bodied; moderate carbonation - a little creamy; moderately dry finish;  o: easy drinking; would pair well with a lot of food;
5704,Gold Stock Ale,4.66,appearance – medium to thick of head and hazy yellow body.  aroma – citrus pine and floral. hint of vanilla or oak  taste – deep and complex. not very hoppy for an ipa. some spicy and again vanilla or oak.  mouthfeel – just right. refreshing while not thin  overall – favorite beer from new england. right amount of hoppy and malt flavors. unique in that i can’t find another beer like it.
5705,Gold Stock Ale,3.58,appearance – thin layer of head on a hazy deep yellow body.  aroma – citrus pine and floral hops all blended together very complex.  taste – hop resins caramel malt a little grainy. not what the aroma led you to expect.  mouthfeel – good for an english ipa not heavy but not too thin either.  overall – not too bad but the taste could have been a little more layered and complex.
5706,Gold Stock Ale,4.35,had on tap at local restaurant in southern connecticut. poured into a us pint glass. this english ipa/pale ale pours a golden amber color with some nice bubbling medium sized head and really nice lacing. smell is of mild hops maybe even goldings or fuggles but with a hint of caramel/two row malts. the taste is perfectly balanced just as this style should be. the hops are faint and not in your face. this paired perfectly with fish and chips. if you are a huge fan of new england brewerys ipas like i am set those tastebuds and expectations aside and picture yourself sitting in a quaint english pub. i am kicking myself for passing on a growler of gold stock the last time they had it at the brewery. well there is always next time. nebco nails this style. cheers!
5707,Gold Stock Ale,4.03,poured from a 32 oz growler filled at the brewery.  pours a lightly hazy deep golden amber color with 2 fingers of off-white head. the head has excellent retention and leaves a fair bit of cobweb lacing as it dissipates. beautiful looking beer.  the aroma is quite faint but there are notes of sweet citrus and oak as well as some cereal grains on the back end.  the taste brings loads of vanilla and oak on the front end followed by some spicy yeast and cereal grains. the finish is quite citrusy and hoppy.  the feel is medium-light bodied with fairly high carbonation. relatively dry finish with some lingering hop spiciness.  overall a very good and very interesting beer. the oak and vanilla works very well with the hops creating a wonderful balance. will definitely snag another growler of this if i get the opportunity.
5708,Foster's Lager,3,i had this beer a couple of times before and always thought of it as a bitter and overly frothy mess but now retrying it now as world class beer expert i must say that it isn’t a bad beer at all. however foster’s premium ale is a lot better in my opinion so if i were to see the lager in the blue can and the ale in the green can i’d go with the green can every time.  style: australian lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 5% | rating: 3
5709,Foster's Lager,3.82,yum!
5710,Foster's Lager,1.76,sampled at outback steakhouse. poured into a large plastic mug with handle. staw/golden with quickly fading head of foam. lots of streaming bubbles. very faint aroma of grains and perhaps some corn. luckily it wasnt skunked. the taste was nothing out of the ordinary. you could tell you were drinking beer. mouthfeel was nothing special either. crisp watery and refreshing on a hot summer day. overall not as bad as you might think. typical mass produced lager. advertised as an australian beer but on tap in every british pub i have drunk in and thats a lot over the years. [fosters was actually introduced in melbourne by two brothers from new york]. despite what paul hogan says in the adverts fosters isnt necessarily australian for beer. lol. while i prefer carlton or castlemaine xxxx i would reach for a fosters over some of the snooty craft beer. lol.
5711,Foster's Lager,3.51,presentation: 25.4 ounce can poured into a pint glass  look: rich golden color. small foamy head. looks better than other comparable beers.  smell: grainy cereal like smell. minor hops odor.  taste: grainy cereal taste to begin with and a bitter hops aftertaste. the taste is distinct and enjoyable.  feel: mouth feel is decent. smooth with a bit of a seltzer feel at the end.  overall it is a respectable lager. nothing remarkable about it but it has a distinct taste which sets it apart from other similarly priced beers. id recommend this beer if youre on a budget but still want a flavorful lager.
5712,Foster's Lager,3.18,this was not a terrible lager. it was reasonably dry without the corruption of sweeter cereal grains. the body was well carbonated with the carbonation being very visible. the grains that came in the initial lead to a clean dry finish. on a hot day this would be exceptionally drinkable.
5713,Foster's Lager,3,pours out of the enormous can a crystal clear gold with an inch of head that dissipates quickly. smells malty with a bit of sweetness. taste follows the nose well with a good solid mouthfeel. i was expecting a bad beer from my peers\ opinions about it but i actually kinda liked it.
5714,Foster's Lager,3.64,this beer is very delicious. yeah its relatively cheap but its a very good tasting lager. an a matter of fact its my favorite beer now. it comes in a 25 oz. can and its just a great lager. not too hoppy and goes down good. i recomend this to anyone who likes just a neutral tasting lager beer. it gives you the buzz you want but the hangover isnt any worse than some of the others ive drank.. try it. youll probably like itl....
5715,Foster's Lager,2.85,from a 750ml can. hard to pour i guess youre just supposed to drink it out of the can. clear golden color with white foamy head. smells of light grain and straw. light body. earthy grain flavor. basic macro lager. nothing really stands out.
5716,Foster's Lager,3.21,poured from a can into a pint glass. pours straw yellow orange with a fluffy white head. smells of cereal grain not too strong but not too weak. tastes of cereal grain. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall an average beer.
5717,Foster's Lager,3.54,foster\s lager 5% abv. pours golden with a 5-finger white head that left great lacing. nose is malty and sweet. taste follows plus slight grain and bitterness. decent mouthfeel overall very good. be sure to say foster\s with an australian accent.
5718,Masala Mama,3.99,pours a clear amber/gold with a legitimate amount of off-white head. leaves nice lacing. aroma is a bold mix of caramel malt and piney hops. flavor follows the nose malty up front with lots of bitterness in the finish. feel is medium bodied a little light on the carbonation. overall a fine ale.
5719,Masala Mama,3.85,co2 version is an annoying combination of pine resin and caramel malt.  cask version is creamy warm and mild.  neither yanked my crank.
5720,Masala Mama,4.21,this is no doubt an old-fashioned ipa strong on the malt/hoppiness side. this is much better than their dortmunder beer i thought. i bought a growler of each. definitely a better than average ipa but not sure it is worth the extra trouble and cost.
5721,Masala Mama,4.37,l: copper-auburn color with 1 finger of soapy foam that retains well some lacing s: pine grapefruit some biscuity/carmel malt aromas t: resinous with a chewy malt backbone. grapefruit candied oranges cherry. f: medium body somewhat velvety good carbonation o: crushed a 32 oz crowler of this easily and probably could have had more. def my go-to west/midwest ipa in the twin cities.
5722,Masala Mama,3.93,cask pour at mthb. cloudy medium amber with cap of thick creamy head. aroma is light hops with some fruity overtones. taste adds a layer of hops to the bready malt base subtle. cask brings a nice creaminess to the brew but hard to believe this is a top 50. not impressed.
5723,Masala Mama,4.29,cask at town hall brewery minneapolis mn  a: the beer is crystal clear amber yellow in color and lacks visible carbonation. it kind of looked like a beer on nitro when the waiter brought it to the table with the yellowish and amber colors settling down and mixing together. it poured with a finger high white head that this excellent properties and consistently left a quarter finger high head covering the surface. s: light to moderate aromas of citrusy hops are present in the nose along with notes of floral hops. t: the taste follows the smell and has flavors of citrusy hops - orange and grapefruit stand out in particular - along with notes of floral hops and hints of herbs. there is a light amount of bitterness. m: it feels very smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel and has a moderate amount of carbonation. o: i;m really glad that i had this beer from a cask as it was a pleasure to drink especially with the smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  serving type: cask
5724,Masala Mama,3.92,had on tap. copper brown with a finger of white foam. smell stars the hops in a bitter and herbal way with supporting caramel malt. taste was pretty average with the hops truly starring but wasnt super memorable beyond the hops. somewhat bready in feel with the hop textures interceding. good ipa but nothing outstanding
5725,Boxer Ice,3.96,was looking for a new beer to try i bought it without knowning it’s a canadian beer 1 pint for 3 cad that’s sounds a good deal love the colour the foam really thick and rich taste good can not say the best lager beer i tasted but the fact it’s family owned and no preservatives made me love this beer
5726,Boxer Ice,1.02,i recently consumed a king can of boxer ice on my birthday. from the first sip i knew their was something wrong. despite the hiss of the can as i opened it their was a lack of carbonation. it had the sweet taste of malted corn syrup and the aftertaste of the can it was in. i question how something like this got past quality control as this is probably the most foul cheaply thrown together beers out there. stomach cramps will induce after about half the can and your desire to drink afterwards will only be driven by your desire to wash your palate. any beer tastes better after drinking this.
5727,Boxer Ice,2.56,this beer is aggressively mediocre but for the price thats about all you could hope for. it is a run of the mill light beer. it does not taste like vanilla or cream soda like some of these other reviews are saying. it starts with a slightly rotten wheat-y flavor and finishes pretty smooth... well smoother than you would expect. i wouldnt recommend this beer but its drinkable. if you lose a bet this is a good choice if you want to give the victor a revenge beer that is still drinkable.
5728,Boxer Ice,2.27,drank from a 12 ounce can. scores are based on the style.  look - kinda cheap design befitting of the cheap price tag. looks like the local softball teams jerseys. you can definitely tell its an ice beer because of the ice cubes.  smell - very light grains wafting in from a distant wind.  taste - cream soda? its weird. mostly nothing but a slight vanilla flavor.  feel - light body and strong tingly carbonation. fairly typical.  overall - eh. mediocre. slightly higher alcohol and $14 for 36 cans i guess its a fine party beer.
5729,Boxer Ice,3.5,well i dont mind this beer myself. of course my taste buds are shot but its heads and tails above boxer lager which is way too sweet and it has a good kick to it. rarely pour it in a glass but when i have theres a decent head. not to little not too much.  plus im on a limited income and $17.11 including tax is hard to beat for a 36 pack. better than miller imo.
5730,Boxer Ice,2.28,ok its cheap tastes like ice beerand goes down easy. this is not a beer to think on. i found it on sale for $8.99 for a 36 pack ($.25 a can). at that price it is hard to beat.
5731,Boxer Ice,3.36,710 ml can served in a pilsner glass  this beauty pours a brilliant golden color and is topped with several inches of eggshell head that leaves no lacing.  the smell is light grain notes.  it has mild malt flavor. it is extremely clean with a dry finish.  thin mouthfeel  at $.95 a can how could i go wrong? i would even pay $1 if it was 8%. it is cheap and easy drinking. great high school kid or college beer.
5732,Boxer Ice,1.82,aroma and flavor is sweetish corn/malts an odd but expected off funk and tart finish. not much in the way of flavor at all apart from the off funk.
5733,Boxer Ice,2.07,served straight out of the freezer into a room temp weizen glass..  pours an apricot golden blonde color 20% opaque. tall 4 finger head; eventually it eats away to 1 finger and then finally a creamy ring.  aroma is wet cardboard herbs apple cores banana peel corn kernels. it actually smells pretty fresh and clean with character.  a deep malt and straw base starts it off but quickly fades to corn juice...then cotton candy. to draw a picture - think of a buttered cob of corn dipped in powdered sugar. some tin follows.  its rather thick and juicy for an ice beer but still somewhat crushable. medium bodied (dare i say) and a carbonated finish.  for a dollar nine its really not terrible but i can afford better so obviously i wont be having this again. i still say when and if im ever down on my luck miller high life will be my brown bag jam.
5734,Boxer Ice,1,worst beer i have ever drank .
5735,Boxer Ice,4,surprisingly good for what people call a cheap beer. in fact i think it could impress in the value department on how good a cheap beer can be category. golden color light head good carbonation slight sweetness that gives it an almost oak beer taste & aroma. i would put this above a lot of beers. good value.
5736,Boxer Ice,2.71,this beer is comfortably in the sh**-category. as evident by the fact that you can pick up a 36-pack for less than 15 bucks. with that said i do consider boxer ice to be on the sh**-throne as the ruler of cheap beers. proudly looking over her kingdom of coors budweiser and pabst.  very drinkable both hot or cold. slightly metallic (might be due to the can). however the sweetness of the beer hides a lot of its flaws. definitely not something ill buy to impress someone. but for if you only have $15 and want drinkable quantity at the lowest possible price this is your best bet.  much better than the regular boxer. just a surprisingly non-sh**y beer - for being a sh** beer that is.
5737,Keystone Light,2.76,not the best beer but you can get 15 cans for $11
5738,Keystone Light,2.46,poured from a 12 oz can into a 12 oz glass. typical straw/golden with streaming bubbles. nice head of foam and lacing. no aroma that i could detect however the beer was not skunked in any way.the taste was somewhat nondescript but once again let you know you were drinking beer. the mouthfeel was a bit watery and light. overall not bad on a hot summer day and ice-cold. i do believe it is an urban legend that ksl is actually coors light in a different package
5739,Keystone Light,2.5,poured into a pilsner glass straight from the fridge.  pours a slightly pale (meaning less vibrant not less bright) yellow gold with a 1 finger fairly quickly dissipating white head.  initial aroma is very yeasty with a little peppery hop smell kind of a light olive green smell. its a little musty.  after agitating i pick up more more hoppy smell as well as a hint of ammonia maybe?  initial taste is seriously like drinking a flavoured seltzer. after a noticeable delay this is followed by a very strong (as strong as a light beer can be) taste of crusty white bread. this carries over to the aftertaste where a rather mild bitterness also expresses itself in the back of the roof of the mouth and the back of the sides and top of the tongue.  there really isnt anything more i can pick up on unfortunately but i mean im sure its brewed with simplicity in mind.  mouthfeel is unsurprisingly very thin and as previously stated its extremely similar to the experience of drinking seltzer. i understand i cant hold it accountable because of the style but it just doesnt take hold anywhere in the mouth  might buy again if its very very cheap but i cant see myself ever drinking this outside the setting of a party or to get hammered and i dont have the desire to push my intoxication too far. so not likely. its honestly not bad! its just yknow.  i will say that as someone who counts calories its honestly decent and i appreciate having it as an option there are better options but not bad.
5740,Keystone Light,1.93,keystone light is simply the poor man’s coors light. it doesn’t taste exactly the same but its similarities puts it in the no frills class competitor. ironically coors makes it and i assume it sells as much keystone light as it does coors to select crowds.  the beer itself is tailored towards budget conscious crowds. the can designs is identical to coors lights can and the pour & mouthful feel is similar.  overall it’s not bad but it does have the market of being budget friend college ready 30 pack of stones for less than 25 dollar mentality
5741,Keystone Light,2.58,12 oz. can best by may 22 2023.. acquired the 15 pack at the local jewel for something like $7.99 on sale and a ticks a tick so why the hell not.  poured to schlitz clear beer mug. a: light fizzy straw yellow color. head isnt great but there is more than on the last cheap beer i just tried .. appears well carbonated. s: light grains. muted fruitiness. doesnt smell like much but i suppose that is to style.. t: tastes like run of the mill american adjunct lager. corn grain. no flavors of wet cardboard or paper which is always a plus. touch of sweetness? m: smooth crisp clean watery very drinkable. overall i suppose i would call it to style.. miller lite is the staple beer in my household and i would call this one a pretty close contender for the quintessential aal / light lager / palate cleanser / beer to have when you just wanna have a beer..  keystone light -----2.5/5
5742,Keystone Light,3.51,light gold minimal head a little retention. smells like mineral water light sulphur wow a lager beer!!! tastes very light malt non descript hops enough to balance it out. not too sweet. i really don’t get the”awful “ rating it’s actually pretty good. if you like micheladas this is perfect.  04/12/23 i just read farther down and saw someone comment on how “little lacing” there was. for real? omg it’s f’n keystone light and you think there’s going to be lacing. lol.
5743,Keystone Light,2.81,rapidly faded head hardly any lacing. tastes of light fruit skin reminiscent of coors beers. its most definitely not deserving of this score. enjoyable very average.
5744,Keystone Light,1.4,this is one of the worst beers that i have ever had. it tastes heavily of corn sugar from the fermenting process. you get what you pay for as this is a cheap beer. if you want cheap there are many other options to choose from.
5745,Genesee Ice Beer,2.5,i bought a 24oz can for 1.29$ because i was on a budget. it doesn\t have much in the sense of appearance or smell. hell even the can art is bland. it\s not bad taste-wise. i was kind of expecting it to be kind of appalling like many ice beers but i have to admit this is one of the better ones. having said that it\s still way down there in comparison to the 1000+ beers i\ve had.
5746,Genesee Ice Beer,2.58,average ice beer - refreshing on a hot summer day
5747,Genesee Ice Beer,2.96,12 ounce can poured into a nonic tumbler.  l---medium white head with minimal retention. left decent lacing though. the beer is a crystal clear medium gold color.  s---sweet maltiness. corn is the primary aroma.  t---taste follows the nose...sweet maltiness and corn. no real hop bite/snap. more flavorful than the top selling aals like coors light/bud light/budweiser.  f---a little bit syrupy. well carbonated.  o---this one is a bargain at $14.95 for a 30 pack in pa.
5748,Genesee Ice Beer,1.96,giant poor alcoholics edition can 24 oz poured into a rather inappropriate dogfish head nonic glass.  has a relatively clear straw blonde body with a surprisingly abiding head of 2 fingers. nice lacing too.  aroma of lottery tickets and wet towels urinal cakes corn general maltiness.  flavor is full of flaws i mean wow i havent had an unclean beer like this in awhile. corn flakes doused in bleach followed by oysters saltines and wet leaves.  feel is crisp but not clean rather starchy on the palate with some actual alcohol heat for 5.5%.  overall ice beers are a joke but i was really surprised that at 5.5% this beer made absolutely no effort to disguise its alcohol content. this is a truly horribly made beer and i\m being completely objective. a warming furnace to your throat and stomach at a measly 5.5% abv.
5749,Genesee Ice Beer,1.8,l: pours typical golden amber color with a reasonably large head and some lacing.  s: corn malt cracker and slight grassy hops.  t: tastes way too alcoholic for the abv. the only ice beer with noticable fusel alcohol tastes worse than steel reserve with slightly less burn. other than that it does taste like corn and more malt than some beers. doesnt taste anything like regular genesee beer the cream ale or even its high gravity cousin genesee black.  f: goes down smooth a little syrupy but not too much body.  overall: the worst ice beer. even at 99 cents for a 24 ounce can there are plenty of better options including all of the other genesee products which are pretty good.
5750,Genesee Ice Beer,2.76,4/24/19 (chicago): $1.16 24 oz can including tax purchased at shop and save on 4/19/19 no canning date noted multiple pours into a pint glass. light straw clear colour pour light white head quickly disappates leaving thin white lacing. sweet corn grain aroma. light corn and malt taste too sweet very thin mouthfeel slight fizzy carbonation light drinking. overall ok offering.
5751,Genesee Ice Beer,3.02,24oz can stamped a249 poured into a bow tie glass at fridge temp 5.5% abv. the beer pours bright pale straw yellow with abundant bone white head. the head recedes to a thin cap and leaves plenty of lacing. the aroma is faint with some corny sweetness and maybe sulfur. the taste is barely sweet with a little tang. minimal grain presence and no bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin bodied adequately carbonated and semi dry in the finish. there is a little slick feel after the swallow but no aftertaste. overall ok. this is an extremely cheap and non-offensive way to deliver alcohol to folks who happen to hate bitterness or grain presence in a beer. i would advise to drink this one ice cold. it does get better as it warms.
5752,Genesee Ice Beer,3.5,a very pleasant surprise! i rate genesee ice highly not so much for being an exceptional beer in itself but for its price-value ratio. at 5.5% abv and as low as $8 for a 15 pack here in ri its body flavour and strength beat out all other popular cheap beers many of which cost significantly more. its little brother genesee light falls (and tastes) flat however. and unlike the other low-end beer brands genesee ice doesnt wreak the same havoc in your stomach if youre drinking a lot which you probably will be with it. due to an ongoing sale its been my cheap beer of choice for months but even if similarly priced with bud rolling rock or narragansett (my prior go-tos) i would argue its better in about every way.
5753,Genesee Ice Beer,3.55,24 ounce can into lager glass canned on 12/21/2017. pours crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. light spotty lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. good appearance. aromas of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honey/pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. taste of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honey/pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. mild herbal floral grassy peppery bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough lightly toasted biscuit light honey/pepper and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. nice robustness of pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. a bit of fruity corn aromas/flavors but not overwhelming. fairly crisp/clean finishing. nicely clean on lager flavors not too fruity/yeasty. lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth moderately bready/grainy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. minimal warming alcohol for 5.5%. overall this is good iced pale adjunct lager. all around good robustness of pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink. nicely clean and rich pils malt/grains and mild earthy hop presence/balance. not too overdone on adjuncts and not overly sweet. a nicely enjoyable offering and well made style example.
5754,Genesee Ice Beer,3.06,(24 oz can f258... purchased cold with several other malt liquor in a frenzy... split between a shaker pint and tulip glass)  l: crystal-clear medium amber colored; good bit of white foam builds on pour but immediately breaks down... actually some thin streaks of belgian lace  s: generic adjunct lager aromas; on the malty (liquor) side... slightly toasty dry straw grain aroma; hints of spiced apple maybe white grape; slight whiff of alcohol... bland sort of manila folder note as well... altogether uninspiring dull  t: rather dry ever-so-slightly caramel-kissed cereal-like malt base; strange notes of corn kernel and wet oxidized interior of lemon rind in finish/aftertaste... light leafy bitterness begging to be intensified... the malt opens up a little but its overall essence is of toasted corn syrup - a spicy ester away from being a mediocre maibock at best?  f: slight touch of sizzle on the edges of whats essentially a marginally watered-down wort... light-medium bodied delicate oily plushness  o: industrial brewing being industrial... not sure why one would bother with a weaker version of a malt liquor - maybe its a bit more daring of a drink than a light beer?... a beer seemingly caught between the better of two directions... buries natty ice but i couldnt see getting this again
5755,Aurelian Lure,4.45,16.9oz bottle. for dating label includes the details of blend seven august 2022. cloudy apricot orange colored body. no real lasting head. no lacing. aroma of apricot oak and rich funk of expresses horse blanket leather and hay. taste is initially quite woody and herb bud like and then the sweet/sour apricot comes in. notes of lemon wash through along with the dry oak. late is white wine. the funk is very much of grass and hay. after taste does not last very long but the essence of apricot lingers. tart and drying mouth feel. the teeth are scraped clean with each sip. quiet carbonation. the apricot expresses so naturally here and is the longest lasting flavor note. the herb oak funk and lemon are worthy subordinates.
5756,Aurelian Lure,4.22,appearance: pours a slightly hazy light amber color with a bubbly collar that fades away; no lacing  smell: bracingly sour; funky with an apricot tone  taste: a hint of apricot passes across the tongue and is followed by a strong funky character; the apricot tone lingers underneath though after the swallow a bracing sourness emerges; oaky dry and a lot of pucker in the finish  mouthfeel: light to medium body; no carbonation  overall: not for the uninitiated aurelian lure harkens back to some of the tongue buckling sours that largely seem to have gone out of fashion these days
5757,Aurelian Lure,4.26,brewed with apricots spontaneously fermented and allowed to ripen to full sour ale maturity youd think that this time honored way of beer making is rooted in the belly of brussels. but nope its austin texas.  aurelian lure is the lambic-like brainchild of jester king pouring with a pale and deep lemon yellow with a light golden center. as the yeasty ale rises with a dainty champagne froth the jaw-tightening scent of citrus vinous and stone fruit carry the piquant tang of cider dusty funk and extended oak aged white wine. as a scantly sweet taste briefly visit the tongue early impressions of wafers honey and sourdough offer a slim malt impact.  a quick wash of acidity across the middle palate shows a quick erase of anything malty and an ushering in of sour apricot that stand proud above the other fruity complements of weathered lemon grapefruit lime and yuzu. dried pineapple peach and white grape all continue to grow from the natural fermentae of the sour ale and play into a strikingly sour late palate of off-vinegar mature and peppery acids that pang away on the sides of the tongue.  light crisp succinct and highly refreshing the session is sweat inducing and tooth achingly sour to satisfy the taste for unblended lambic in the deep south. as an afterglow of weathered woods wine rot and an overall mossy type of earthiness come in brief waves the aftertaste is otherwise short and concisely winey.
5758,Aurelian Lure,3.94,murky darker yellow body with a white cap. smell blasts you with sour apricot backed by complex oak orange and farmhouse yeast. taste is a cover up of the scandal. the scandal you ask? the apricot is wickedly acidic and pretty sour too this is then covered up by farmhouse yeast light barrel funk lemon and oak but for that moment when the scandal was alone on the palate it was rough. very bright and sour funk is not impactful here oak is brightly so acidity builds as the secret wants to get out. i love jk but this is the #15 wild ale in the world? nah i wouldnt have this again
5759,Aurelian Lure,4.46,pours a hazy golden color with a thin head that dissipates immediately. the aroma is immediately noticeable with a strong scent of apricots and a subtle hint of oak. upon tasting the apricot flavor dominates with a tartness that is balanced by a slight sweetness. the oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity imparting a mild vanilla flavor that complements the fruitiness of the apricots. the beer finishes with a refreshing tartness that lingers on the tongue leaving a dry finish. one of the standout features of aurelian lure is its balance. despite being a sour ale the tartness is not overwhelming and is instead complemented by the sweetness of the apricots and the subtle oak notes. this makes for a beer that is both complex and approachable with a flavor profile that is likely to appeal to both seasoned sour beer enthusiasts and those new to the style. another noteworthy aspect of aurelian lure is its mouthfeel. the beer is medium-bodied with a light carbonation which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. the combination of tartness and effervescence make this a perfect summer beer though its enjoyable year-round. overall jester king brewerys aurelian lure is a fantastic sour ale that showcases the brewerys expertise in wild yeast and spontaneous fermentation. its a beer that is both complex and approachable with a balanced flavor profile and a refreshing mouthfeel. while it may be difficult to find due to its limited availability its certainly worth seeking out for any beer enthusiast looking to try something truly special.
5760,Aurelian Lure,4.13,bold sour with apricots. wood mixed fermentation. very good sipper.
5761,Natural Ice,2.5,cheap beer for the basement bar. good beer for just a beer or two after work etc.
5762,Natural Ice,4.91,natty ice should get more credit than it gets its kills best ice and icehouse destroys bud light crisp clean taste smooth 5.9 abv and 4.2 carbs 1.19 for 25 0z compared to bud light 25 oz cans at 2.49 a win win for me
5763,Natural Ice,3.08,presentation: 12 oz can poured into pint glass  look: clear golden color. head is surprisingly large and lasts longer than expected.  smell: prominent aromas of grain corn and roasted malt. minimal hops aroma.  taste: strong caramelized malt and grain flavors. minimal hops flavor. minor citrus aftertaste. flavor is light but refreshing and smooth. quite tasty!  feel: smooth and light mouthfeel.  overall: this beer is better than youd think it would be. nothing about it is below average for its segment. flavor is more complex than i expected. considering its 5.9 percent alcohol by volume its quite smooth and drinkable. id recommend this beer to anyone who likes drinkable american lagers.
5764,Natural Ice,3.12,12 oz can poured into a pilsner glass at 43°f  pours a clear yellow gold with a 2 finger white head with 1 ring of lacing.  initial aroma is general lager smell mostly yeast with a good amount of pineapple as well as some lemon and starting to ferment green apple. pretty nice honestly. after smelling a few more times i pick specifically that the yeast is a crusty white bread smell any yeasty type thats dusted with flour that you can tear apart. after agitating i notice almost a yogurt bacteria strain aroma.  initial taste before swallowing is light yeast and maybe biscuity malt. this becomes slightly peppery/tingly and floral. after swallowing it becomes lightly sweet lightly nutty and the peppery floral taste grows stronger and remains in the aftertaste. 5.9 abv but i can actually taste some alcohol.  feel is thin but not watery and not super crisp or refreshing. additionally the carbonation fades quickly. honestly though fairly smooth and i dont dislike it.  overall i dont dislike this. i didnt love the taste but genuinely its alright. i can say that i thought it was very coherent.  not likely to buy again more than maybe twice in my life but honestly not bad for the price picked up a single.
5765,Natural Ice,1.94,poured from a 25oz can  on a vigorous pour barely two fingers of fizzy white head firm then quickly in under a minute dissipate to essentially no head. color is of golden piss.  aroma is rough almost metallic from all the apple off flavor going on here. smells like beer in the bottom of a trash can.  taste follows the aroma with the bright green apple bitterness but i do pick up a touch if grain and adjunct in the back but not much else. before becoming accustomed to the flavor it did come off as a bit boozy.  feel isnt quite chuggable but i think there may be some fusel alcohols that are just making things sort of harsh. not as drinkable as some malt liquors despite the relatively quick finish.  overall this isnt great but you can get used to it and it is identifiable as a beer. obviously low quality and seems like it could be the base for mikes or some other malt beverage.
5766,Natural Ice,3.24,22 smacks for a 30 rack. this has a smidge more flavor than your worst beer in the store montucky cold snack. also almost doubles it up in alcovolume. that is to say its clean cheaper stronger and more flavorful. this beer is a winner for what it is.... multinational budget strong lager.
5767,Natural Ice,2.72,this beer holds a special place in my heart. while its certainly not the best tasting it still has positive qualities that get it such a high rating. specifically its alcohol content. while were only talking about a 1.7% abv difference between natty ice and natty light it makes a world of difference. this beer has also been found to be the most cost efficient way to get sloshed outside of drinking hard alcohol. (at least in my area) its a college essential that i would put above textbooks.
5768,Natural Ice,4.24,just a good all bargain american ice lager. very smooth and delicate flavor. the snobs will hate it but its a great value and delicious on a hot summer day.
5769,Natural Ice,1.79,what sort of unfortunate turns of events led me to drink this? i … just don’t. even if that’s all there is available. although it’s nickname is “natty ice” this was just plain nasty.
5770,Boxer Lager,2.98,poured from a silo can into a pint glass. pours golden orange with a fluffy white head. smells of sweet adjunct grain nothing else. tastes of plain lager grain. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall an average beer.
5771,Boxer Lager,2.62,compared to coors light? masterclass.
5772,Boxer Lager,2.57,note: i was honest on four of the categories but boosted the overall score due to the budget of this beer.  i enjoy many styles of craft beer and will on occasion spend nearly $30 on a four pint pack of high quality stuff. today i was looking to stock up on football watching beer. my go-tos have been high life or yeungling for the bulk drinking lagers. i was at a shop rite in new jersey on novermber 5th 2022 when i happened upon this stuff. i saw 30 packs of natty and genessee for $24. high life was $26. something called boxer premium lager was $19.99 for a 36 case! that is 55 cents a can in 2022!! i though.. jeez that will probably be god awful and likely poisonous. so i checked beeradvocate and it got some decent reviews. i said ill give it a try. if its awful i only have 35 more
5773,Boxer Lager,5,not to objective because it is my favorite lager and costs less than a buck for 24 ounces.  it has a cara-pils malt taste that harkens to the beers they made at that brewery since i started drinking. some comments attribute it to yeast...which makes some sense because you couldnt afford expensive malt at that price.  most younger serious beer drinkers are sucking down heavy hopped beers. if your looking for your beer to taste like high gravity bitters or grapefruit you will need to spend more money.  this beer is distinctive and produced in relatively tiny batches. at the price there is no comparison.  it reminds me a bit of beer from india.
5774,Boxer Lager,3.74,this is what happens when millennial beer-snob know-it-alls review a beer.  if this beer were twice as expensive and packaged differently with maybe the silhouette of muhammad ali or a sharp photograph of a boxing glove the 30-somethings would be falling all over themselves.  as it is this is a cheap easily drinkable beer with a wonderful mouthfeel and a nutmeg hefeweizen taste.  not my first choice. but an ok choice.  is it a budhead? *( the tantalizing wonderful heavenly mix of two great north american loggers moosehead and budweiser mixed in a 50/50 proportion? ) hells no.  nothing is.  ( and if youre not thinking of going to the store and buying a sixer of each both moosehead and budweiser and trying it yourself in a tall dimpled or nonic glass then you are simply a fool )  but i digress. boxer is a cheap easy buzz. throw a lemon slice in and maybe once squeeze of honey and youve got yourself a terrific summer cooler. even adding ice wont ruin things for you....
5775,Boxer Lager,1.04,id rather go sober. manjit is disgusting.
5776,Boxer Lager,3.61,poured from 12-ounce can into a vintage odouls bow-tie glass. stunningly clear golden color with a finger or two of white head that settles rather rapidly. as aals go this is pretty inoffensive. boxer is light bodied not too sweet and mostly dry on the finish with some light grain grassy hops and hints of tart apple on the nose and palate. pretty typical. however there is something else going on here: there are unmistakable notes of hefeweizen yeast which contribute aromas and flavors of banana and clove. these notes are present in some other offerings from minhas / rhinelander as well. is this a characteristic of their house yeast? i dont know. but those notes of banana and clove really give this a pleasant kick. (and you cant beat the price!)
5777,Boxer Lager,3.32,l. clear light bright orange with noticable carbonation for a lasting thick ring and partial patch. a. cracker vague cereal grain faint candy corn bread hay dry grass. smells just ok. t. bready and biscuit-y a bit corn chip-y some citrus in there like lemon and orange pith corn flakes with a sprinkle of sugar some toffee/honey maltiness in there as well. finishes with a pithy bitterness and a pinch of ethanol. f. not actually watery a bit above a light body below average carbonation not too dry. o. given all the lousy reviews im pleasantly surprised. heady topper it aint but you could pay twice as much for for a worse beer.
5778,Boxer Lager,1,colleges kids drink this because its cheap. its disgusting. deserves a zero rating!
5779,Boxer Lager,2.5,l: pours yellow gold permeated by streams of rapidly rising bubbles under a 1 frothy white cap with poor retention  s: some apple green apple faint hops and a hint of movie theater popcorn butter. green apple is the biggest aroma  t: sweet corn and a mild corn sweetness start the flavors with apple some very mild spicy hop flavor and a very mild hop bitterness  f: the body is light and the carbonation is medium full  o: the beer is slightly sweet and misses the boat on character and interest
5780,Boxer Lager,2.75,its a cheap lager. nothing more nothing less. pours a watery gold. head diminishes quickly. very weak aroma. corny barley flavors. highly carbonted.
5781,Boxer Lager,2.59,minhas craft brewery boxer lager 12 fl. oz. can production coded but without freshness dating $6.99 / 15-pack case @ javies beverage philadelphia pa  notes via stream of consciousness: its clear but not as clear as i thought it would be i cant see my finger prints through the glass nor are my fingers really that clear. odd. the initial finger-thick head of bright white that rose up over the fairly deep golden body is now already gone but there are some splashes of lacing left behind. the aroma is sweetish and dare i say malty? its not grainy and its clear that theres some adjunct in use but there is some maltiness to it. theres also unfortunately some esters that i connect with higher fermentation... not good. the flavor follows and again its surprisingly malty and sweetish like wort. i dont detect any specific oxidation like a papery characteristic but it could be that some initial oxidation is making it seem more malty. just a theory. its medium bodied and crisp. i didnt find any hops in the aroma nor do i find any in the flavor except for a touch of an herbal and leafy note in the finish. its background though and that higher alcohol ester thing is still there and distracting. this is obviously not well made but its cheap - although there are many better made budget beers on the market that cost less. disappointing.  2.75 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 3.25 / 2.5 = 2.59 out of 5
5782,Boxer Lager,2.87,poured from 24 oz. can into a pint glass  appearance – the beer pours a very nice golden amber color with tons of tiny bubbles streaming up through the brew and producing a two finger head of white foam. the head has a modest level of retention fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.  smell – the aroma of the brew is strongest of sweeter smells of caramel and a decent showing of corn syrup. along with these aromas comes a decent amount of a metallic smell.  taste – the taste begins with a mix of a bready light caramel and corn cereal taste mixed with a bit of a metallic flavor. the metallic flavor gets stronger in nature as the taste advances all while the bready and the corn fade a bit. all the while a bit of a cardboard flavor develops and with a loss much of the caramel one is left with a somewhat off metallic and cardboard corny taste to linger on the tongue.  mouthfeel – the body of eh brew is on the slightly thicker side (for a 5 % adjunct lager) with a carbonation level that was average. a little thinner body may have been slightly better for the mix of caramel and corn upfront and may have downplayed some of the off flavors slightly better. overall the feel was not all that bad though  overall – not the tastiest of brews but for the cheap price it is actually a decent go too. a good party brew.
5783,Medianoche - Coconut,4.23,thick syrupy sweetness.
5784,Medianoche - Coconut,4.37,this is my first time ever having a stout from weldwerks and its my first medianoche (i dont even know if they make stouts that arent in that series). this is really quite good. im a coconut fiend and this doesnt disappoint its essentially liquid dessert - milk chocolate coconut. to me its sweet but not diabetic sweet. its less sweet than coconut vibes (shared aka side project) but its also less coconut forward. coconut vibes is also liquid milk chocoluate coconut but it has a noticeable coconut pop. this is so integrated that the coconut is integrated but not popping. id prefer the popping but this is way easier to drink than that. if i was only going to buy 1 id probably buy coconut vibes only because of that noticeable coconut pop. god i love coconut.
5785,Medianoche - Coconut,2.28,this one pours a fairly flat looking inky and gloopy looking black color with no head or lacing.  this smells like pure sugar cheap melted chocolate milkshake coconut syrup and caramel.  this is actually disgusting. this series used to be some of the best barrel aged stouts in the country but weldwerks has just gone off the deep end with these. it’s just tastes like sweet stout glue basically – it’s basically liquified black sugar – it’s basically…you get it right? it’s just way too sweet and cloying with barely any barrel. there’s not even that much coconut it’s just way too sweet of a base – just loads of cheap overbearing chocolate character.  this is too thick and not drinkable at all with very little carbonation. there’s not much booziness but that’s maybe the only single kind of good thing i can say about this.  what happened to you weldwerks? where did you go so wrong?
5786,Medianoche - Coconut,4.69,this was scrumptious - wow! so much coconut on the nose and palate plus dark chocolate nice roast bourbon decent sweetness without being cloying; very thicc mouthfeel great barrel; roasty coconut finish.
5787,Presidente,3.75,underrated for sure. so much flavor malty grainy. light straw in color. bright playful mouthfeel. worst i can say is it had a wee bit of metal but subdued as it drank.
5788,Presidente,4,first off this is not a perfect beer. but it does what it’s trying to achieve as close to perfection as i could imagine. this is a beer that was designed for hot dominican days under the sun. it cannot afford to be heavy. for as light as it is it’s got plenty of flavor and the flavor is malty and delicious.
5789,Presidente,2.96,presidente: the beer no president would ever drink...
5790,Presidente,2.69,it’s not great not terrible. kind of reminds me of a maltier thicker version of mich ultra but with a little bitter tinge to it. this was from a can so wasnt off flavors. just has a bit of hop to it i guess.
5791,Presidente,2.5,shared 330 ml green bottle at local tasting. pale golden colour low white head. weak sweetish aroma notes of grass and artificial candy. bland flavour but not offensive. no doubt drinkable under the dominican sun but far from a great beer.
5792,Presidente,1.06,not sure if this is just an off beer of far out of date or whats going on but it smells like must and the flavor is pretty offensive and astringent. i do not enjoy this one and would have a hard time getting it down. its not for me.
5793,Presidente,2.28,12oz bottle into a pint glass. best by 12/1/21 so couple days late here. actually brewed in st. louis for freshness.  pale watery yellow body. steady carbonation. small white head shrinks to a ring and covering but does leave some lacing.  strong corny aroma.  corn on the taste lightly sweet.  mouth between thin and medium finish sweet and slightly grainy.  overall not my cup of tea.
5794,Presidente,3.66,bottle purchased at carnegie diner in new york ny.  this one pours a golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells like crackery malt corn and grainy sweetness.  this is definitely your basic caribbean lager but served super cold it’s fine. it’s very crisp with very little flavor but it’s refreshing.  there are no real off flavors here and it’s nicely drinkable with a crisp and clean feel.  this gets the job done. it’s not a great beer or anything but it does just fine.
5795,Presidente,5,not many pilsners out there with more flavor. has a pungent after taste that i really enjoy. a cold presidente goes down quick and is hard to beat for refreshment. an underappreciated beer that is great for all day weekend events or if youre drinking regularly in the evenings and want to keep the toll on your beer gut in check. not the cheapest pilsner but much more affordable than my shi shi taste in neipas that are frequently in the $15+ range for a 4pack. everything a good pilsner should be and a little more. full bud is my other go to pils but lacks the bold flavor and international appeal of presidente!
5796,Presidente,3.4,12oz green bottle freshest before 12dec21 poured into a vintage bowtie glass at fridge temp 5% abv per label. the beer pours brilliantly bright pale gold with off white head. the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and few bubbles. slight lacing. the aroma is pale malt corn and slight sweetness. the taste is semisweet pale malt with corn vegetable oil movie theater popcorn butter and faint bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. overall not great.
5797,Choklat,4.05,650 ml bottle courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 11.0%. pitch black colour moderate creamy tan head. intense aroma of cocoa / chocolate. the flavour has also loads of chocolate and cocoa but the sweetness is not too extreme. also some roasted coffee notes. a moderate hoppy bitterness in the finish (chinook and willamette) balances some of the chocolate sweetness. very drinkable for an 11% beer. i had no problem finishing the bottle - but if you hate chocolate this is clearly not a beer for you.
5798,Choklat,4.44,ive had many opportunities to drink choklat oranj and really liked it. had this one for a few years and thought a snowy christmas would be a good time to drink it. really hits the spot. i guess it could be a dessert beer but when its freezing outside and the snow is blowing itll do. looks like motor oil with very little head. just like an imperial stout should. with my diminished sense of smell i get chocolate (imagine that) and malt. cant decide if its milk chocolate bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate. taste is the star here. chocolate of course but i dont think its too sweet. nice clean finish i could drink it for dessert but its fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter. mouthfeel is almost perfect. slightly thick smooth as silk and just about right. overall a really good imperial stout. unfortunately it doesnt seem to be available any longer but should it pop up again im definitely getting another bottle or two
5799,Choklat,4.25,22oz bottle. no dating information found. black colored body with ruby back lit highlights. two fingers of tan head settles back to bubbly cap. leaves very little lacing. aroma is similar to a chocolate malt. smells very sweet. taste is sweet but also bittersweet and with a little smoky char. displays many types of chocolate from sweet milk chocolate to bitter dark chocolate. roasted malts are there for support. mouth feel is about medium but the texture is more rich and with slight syrup. good carbonation. this is a beer made to display many forms and textures of chocolate fudge to syrup to milk chocolate balls to bittersweet. ultimately sweet and best suited for a dessert experience.
5800,Amsterdam Maximator,1.92,way to sweet and taste like a european old english from a plastic bottle horrible!
5801,Amsterdam Maximator,1.75,june 2007: 500 ml can supplied by my friend olav. brewed by dutch export breweries. abv was 11.6%. golden colour moderate head. weak aroma a hint of white wine and honey. very sweet and alcoholic flavour. pretty bad.
5802,Amsterdam Maximator,1.43,managed to get to the review box without seeing previous ones...yesss..! its difficult.  left out the fridge for 30 minutes before drinking.  initial impressions i do not like the green can much. for me green is not beer. its the devil or maybe wheatgrass juice or broccoli.  for a strong beer at 11.6% it is very light. basically like a lager with a bit more colour. head goes down fast.  aroma has no fruitiness nothing complex...just fizziness and a hint of sawdust.  not looking forward much to the taste...  taste is intense spirit like. much better than a lager like carlsberg or heineken as at least there is taste. though the taste is alcohol almost vodka and not a complex brewed taste with lots of flavour this is obviously made for the alcohol not the taste. the perfect beer for someone who hates their life wants to get drunk forget things and who wants to save money as much as possible.  would i drink if i was homeless..? for sure. there is fuck all else to do and i probably do not want to break another tooth opening a bottle of chimnay bleu.  the taste has elements of honey lots of sweetness (surprising for such a strong beer).  its my opinion that the ingredients are false. they have basically mixed beer with pure alcohol and sugar. therefore alcohol should be on the ingredients. perhaps they do not have to add this as a seperate one...haha clever.  this has not been brewed it has been mixed.  still its better than a mass produced lager. though really it is the same just mixed with alcohol. so it gets a pretty low rating from me...
5803,Amsterdam Maximator,2.51,my that’s some alcohol burn you got there....very malty lager with lots of heat. looks good though with nice thick creamy head. but then again you’re not drinking this for taste you want a buzz...and you’ll get it.
5804,Amsterdam Maximator,1.42,truly horrible. bought as a curiosity from a french supermarket shelf.  trampagne at it\s most cynical maximum alcoholic units per buck formula  curiously syrupy when overchilled (freezer incident)  avoid
5805,Amsterdam Maximator,2.87,tastes very sweet. you can feel the alcohol.
5806,Amsterdam Maximator,2.95,this one should just fall into the malt liquor category. picked this up from a small store in paris for a good cheap buzz before heading out. its got a very strong malty bready flavor and a lit of heat from the alcohol as it warmed. not gonna lie i was expecting a lot worse after seeing the score on ba but hey i didnt mind it. tastes much better out of a can.. not worthy of a bock glass.
5807,Amsterdam Maximator,2.06,another can brought back from the south of france in sep 13: this 500ml monster was cracked open on 2 dec 13 well before its expiry date.  poured (twice) into a la chouffe tulip at home.  bright light golden/amber with a deep head on each pour the heads tried to hang around for a while too.  a hangover in a single can: smells grainy tinny and alcoholic tastes grainy tinny and alcoholic palate wise i thought it grainy tinny and alcoholic overall it was grainy tinny and alcoholic.  it actually got a little better as it warmed and my second glass was almost pleasantwell almost.
5808,Amsterdam Maximator,1.45,got this one in normandy at a grocery store. this one is max intense! described as a beer rich in ingredients with a long brewing process.  from a 50cl can into a pint glass  appearance: pours a three finger loose looking white head with decent retention. really loose and chunky looking. perfectly clear amber orange with medium carbonation. force carbonated. fades to a chunky wisp and leaves foamy chunky wisp on the sides of the glass. splotchy wisp leaves some foamy lacing down the glass.  smell: bread and grainy malts corn and some alcohol.  taste: rough going. boozy and sweet grain up front with sweet bread and corn into the finish. a bolder finish is boozy with alcohol corn and sweet grainy malts. not pleasant in the least. harsh.  palate: medium body and carbonation. a little light goes down airy and bubbly with a harsh burn at swallow and finishes slightly sweet on palate. some alcohol lingers.  overall: not a doppelbock at all. this is simply a strong euro pale lager and a really strong one at that. i guess it\s better than malt liquor but the only reason one would even consider drinking this would be to get mashed on the cheap. i can\t believe a brewer would taste this and go yes this is exactly what i wanted...
5809,Anabasis,4.38,750ml waxed and capped bottle into a side project snifter.  pours rich muddy and dense. no head no lace huge oily chunky legs. nose is booze raisin anise brown sugar sweet soy sauce and plum. very aromatic. beer opens dried purple fruit. notes of prunes sweet soy sauce anise and raisin. layers of brown sugar molasses in the middle. bone dry and boozy at the end. syrup tobacco oak and almost a salty molasses in the aftertaste. fantastic complexity. body is full with low carbonation. thick oily and chewy on the palate. boozy bone dry finish with a sticky aftertaste.  very solid. great complexity.
5810,Anabasis,4.65,appearance - the beer was almost black in appearance with some variation in color and little carbonation.  smell - the nose was composed of the barrel and dark fruits. it lean toward the sweet side.  taste - the bourbon barrel was strong with this one but not hot. notes of port fruit leather tobacco cherries and oak were present. needless to say it was a diverse pallet. the port and oak notes really stood out. this was a sipper.  mouthfeel - the body was not overly thick especially when judged to today’s outrageous standards. carbonation was muted.  overall - this is an elite barleywine.
5811,Anabasis,4.65,blend #5. thanks to luscious_malfoy for hooking me up with this bottle! so the appearance is not a looker: sludgy brown body no head but the rest of this beer is breathtaking. big rich and complex rustic bourbon barrel barley toasted caramel tons of dark fruit rye molasses char black licorice vanillins and leather nose. taste is similar: adds slight anise no licorice and char though oxidized sugars with attached earthiness vanillins emerge over time more. feel is thick and warm with great barrel character barley splashes on the palate in such a smooth way luxurious and complex though heavy. met the hype!
5812,Anabasis,4.63,blend 5 poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip. perfectly sweet. nicely thick. this ranks up their with some of the best revolution bw in my opinion.
5813,Anabasis,4.02,a: a zinnwaldite brown discharge to the carafe with a fisher cat disguise as the highlights near a ruddy duck tint. the stabilizing agents on the collar lack the hydrophobic polypeptides to substantiate; nonetheless they are attuned to the design through brevity. as such an output that has a cassava toned neck and a roman mushroom hued rim. the latticework suffers from the negative – appropriate – materials but there’s a residue leeway using gentle agitation. this necessities at the launch which is hastily cut inside the minute(s) as a new nuance defines the drippy – cathedral – windows  s: the blend plays to the barrels with an accompany netting over the malts while thickly layering esters atop hop sanities. chiefly a presence on acetates that pushes a solvent characteristic above the finer points as they struggle – against epoxy – at the outset. nonetheless an oak derivative that midriffs on furfurals which benefit the grain bill by advancing the sweet caramel notations around colomba di pasqua. the road has a rabitos royale cusp with a cherry cordial prompt as sultanas devise boerenjongens. moreover a chord on orange blossom honey which pursues a robust earthiness while transmitting coniferous woodlands. this simulates treks covering douglas fir & scots pine trees while natural copal resins air above. subsequently a balmy increment to the hour for attuning burnt sugar toffee to the skins of grapes as the schedule concatenates on ethyl hexanoates. namely aniseed upon sundried apples while the cask to malt ratio encompasses an oak plank grit on moravian wafers. the ventilation across the clocked periods delivers caved moscatel congruities which meld raisin marmalatas into eucalyptus shrubs. in due course a @ > 80°f that sticks an aridness on guaiacols over beeswax while a meerschaum presence stains vintage – vinylon – coats  t: an isoamyl octanoate shadow to the deeply drawn hemicelluloses where the oak structures pitch lipid derivatives. there is a solvent continuation which is calmer than the odors let on yet a paint to wood varnish – remnant – remains over the initial records. the direction incorporates daim bars to german nougat sweets as vínartertas concoct. underneath a drawing on teakwood by a deciduous nature beyond vanilla agroforests. secondly a recognition – of the diastatic enzyme conversions – that benefits the malt saccharifications over maple crème caramels while drawing on peruvian coffees. there is an earthy hop poise to the residual sweetness which lends a woodsy bite to the course. in doing so the blend advances without choking and furthers the development behind acetates as tied to the cask enhancements. a development that’s constantly subjected to the °f upticks as open air addresses the carafe for an oxidized maturity outside the porous wood doings. in this situation the process provokes vintage armagnacs where peculiar leathers top candid fruits besides dated mink boots against flue-cured tobacco. a continuation that hints at shabby – masonry – chimneys while phenolic compounds deliver eugenols over the charred lactone sentients  m: a texture that delineates a sharp bite across barbed resins which imbalances the kick-off. coupled with tannin constitutions for elevating (& refining) dry executions against a soft glutinousness. as such a dexterity with a sensitive viscosity through a warming decree yet careful on the inebriant malaises as carbonation brings a soft effervescence. the output lends a harmonic bitterness with a greenery balance by the phased hop pillars  o: emphasizes the 26mths to 19mths with a warm barrel perceptiveness which is slightly furthered outside the necessary transfers considering a start that battles to make inroads. a blend that has a robust grain bill where temperaments platform in steps as reconciliations take place on the divergences
5814,Anabasis,4.76,blend 6
5815,Anabasis,4.84,blend #6 - loads of charred toffee accented by hints of nuts raisin and chocolate. very strong molasses notes on the back end. great flavor across the full palate. does not lack. truly enjoyable experience.
5816,Anabasis,4.49,blend #6  this extremely deep and dense absolutely american in character. lots of charred toffee accented by hints of candied nuts bakers chocolate dates and raisins up front. the finish adds intense woody tobacco leafy hops light spice earthy vanilla and an intensely boozy exhale. i also get a pretty strong molasses note throughout absolutely nothing subtle or subdued about this but its a helluva lot of fun to drink. falls just half a tick shy of living up to the hype. looking forward to the second glass tomorrow or the next day.
5817,Milwaukee's Best Light,3.78,pours a 2 pillowy white head with plenty of lacing. color is pale straw with plenty of streaming carbonation. aroma: very mild grains. mouthfeel: crisp with a dry finish. flavor: pleasant grains and a surprising hop presence for the style. overall: very pleased with this bargain basement light beer. at less than $0.60 a serving it\s hard to beat.
5818,Milwaukee's Best Light,1.9,gold clear loose white head no retention. smells like mineral water. no malt or hops present. the initial flavor is ok halfway through before you swallow there’s a stale popcorn flavor that lingers on your palate. there’s better budget beers out there. not for me.
5819,Milwaukee's Best Light,2.07,out of can it pours a bright crystal clear gold with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly. lazy bubbles run up my glass edge telling the tale of its minimal carbonation mouthfeel. smells a little grainy a tiny bit malty. tastes follows the nose fairly well. i was expecting this beer to be on the fizzy side and double checked the date on the can and was as fresh as can be just seemed kind of flat compared to say miller lite. i think i like this more than that despite that difference.
5820,Milwaukee's Best Light,3.38,16oz can stamped dec0522 32 poured into a pilsner glass at fridge temp 4.1% abv. the beer pours extremely bright very pale gold with nearly white head. the head recedes to an uneven ring and leaves a web of lacing. the aroma is on the strong side for the style with stale grain and corn syrup. the taste is very light with a hint of corny malt vegetable oil and a slightly bitter finish. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a semi dry finish. overall mediocre light aal. better in the looks and drinkability categories than taste. could definitely use a few more days in the tank to clean up.
5821,Milwaukee's Best Light,4.25,looks like a beer smells like a beer taste like a beer feels like a beer and overall id say its a pretty darn good beer for after mowing the yard on a hot day like i just did. and the price is pretty darn good for a six-pack of 16oz. don\t need no fu-fu\ beer just a real cold real beer. bottoms up!!
5822,Milwaukee's Best Light,1,drain-pour!
5823,Milwaukee's Best Light,2.44,look of golden straw. smell very fine stale open can from the night before smell. tastes faintly stale. not undrinkable just somewhat off. feels great. it is not overly carbonated feels light. in iowa and illinois is 12-13 a 30 pack. extremely cheap. it is a great party supply beer. in the same vein keystone light is the same if not a little cheaper beer that is a far superior beer (all things considered). i can see why some people get used to it cause the cost and beer flavor but i cannot get past the stale after taste.
5824,Milwaukee's Best Light,5,overallits a really good cheap beer!!!
5825,Milwaukee's Best Light,1.87,not good drink if there’s literally nothing else. better than mikes hard lemonade.  it is smooth though
5826,Broccoli,4.31,canned 8/10/23. brewed in brooklyn.  l: pours a hazy dark gold with a short creamy sticky white head. thin irregular lacing.  s: muted aromas of orange mango and grapefruit.  t: peach and mango up front some citrus orange and lemon in the middle. finishes very pleasantly dry with some bitterness.  f: medium mouthfeel. medium to low carbonation.  o: nice transition from tropical to citrus then a sharp pivot to a dry/bitter almost west coast finish.
5827,Broccoli,3.53,not sure why the called it broccolibut this is a good neipa. no worries there in no leafy green in here just a very good tasting hazy.
5828,Broccoli,4.42,16 ounce can canned on 06/07/2023. served in a chalice the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch off-white head. head retention and lacing are both pretty good. i like the aroma the brew smells like pineapple mango grapefruit orange and white grapes. for the most part i think the taste is similar to the aroma but theres also some pear dank/earthy and honeydew melon flavors noticeable too. mostly tropical fruity tasting to me. mouthfeel/body is medium its coating and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. i thought this was a pretty good overall brew certainly worth trying if you get the chance!
5829,Broccoli,4.28,had fresh can. finally trying an iconic oh brew. appealing look and feel. tasty in a somewhat average oh neipa style with bit of dank. came across as more ipa than imperial ipa. glad i tried but this far into the game it didn’t wow. will see how other 3 cans go down over time.
5830,Broccoli,3.66,i get a pineapple citrus smell and taste with a hint of the white grape that the label might be talking about. aftertaste i do taste hints of mango. really like what other half does only have had the cabbage prior. maybe it\s almost the same? i don\t know but its a good beer.
5831,Oktoberfest,3.74,had this on draft. look: came in a 12 ounce mug. copper color with an off white head. arrived without a head and very little lace. aroma: bread malts a little caramel sweetness. taste: toasted malts and some sweetness. easy drinking. decent slightly above average octoberfest.
5832,Oktoberfest,4,tasty stuff from a quality outfit. l: from the can & it is appropriately festive. s: quite a bit of aroma. very nice. get the malts the sweetness richness. t: follows the nose. plenty of sweetness with a bit of a tangy bitter after taste. good stuff f: pretty rich for a lager. o: works for me. from some of the reviews i guess your mileage may vary. but tasty oktoberfest in this man’s opinion.
5833,Oktoberfest,3.62,clear copper with big dense off-white head great retention thin rings of lace toasted bread aroma some caramel a bit of grape (leads me to believe they went heavy on munich malt) tastes like it smells slightly sweet medium bodied and appropriately carbonated a touch sticky not my favorite octoberfest
5834,Oktoberfest,3.25,drinking from a sixtel keg just tapped. its interesting. the color is a rich copper-gold with nice straw colored head. there almost zero aroma and a bland slightly sweet taste to match but nothing unpleasant. its very drinkable!
5835,Oktoberfest,4.23,a very clear dark amber appearance with a lasting white head body and carbonation both hover around medium aroma is maltgrainy dark breaddark breadtoasted grain breaddark honey taste has a very mild sweetness but stays true to the aroma. overall an excellent oktoberfest
5836,Oktoberfest,4.16,copper brew with a frothy yellow head -- it looks beautiful. nose evinces rich bready malt. its medium-bodied and lightly carbonated definitely quaffable. there are both sweet and toasty malt flavors on the palate. the finish boasts a very slight touch of hops. its an interesting take on the style and ill be glad to have it again. i would however mistake this for a conventional german oktoberfest.
5837,Oktoberfest,4.51,found a 12pk of this recently for the bargain of $6. i absolutely love märzens & festbiers and i know that they age quite well so lets give it shot!  l: pours a beautiful clear copper with a fluffy 2 finger tan head with great retention. delicate lacing forms on the glass.  s: very forward in the maltiness department. caramel toffee dark roasted bread and roasted nuts fill the nose first followed by an herbal and floral aroma from the hops. smells like a real winner!  f: flavors follow the nose to a t. the sweet maltiness is perfectly balanced with the subtle herbal floral noble hops that help cleanse the palate for the next sip. overall quite rich.  f: medium-full bodied creamy smooth and easily sessionable for being as rich as it is but is a little heavy for the style.  o: tröegs are really on to something here. this märzen can easily stand toe to toe with anything brewed in germany. its beautiful to look at rich and flavorful and surprisingly sessionable. this is truly an excellent choice!
5838,Oktoberfest,4,12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single for $1.99. freshest by 12/03/22 so this was probably bottled four or five months before that date in either early july or august. if so then this beer is three to four months old.  look: pours a perfectly clear medium copper color. comes with one-finger of a tan colored head with decent retention. slow to moderate visual carbonation.  smell: nice malt-forward notes of caramel toffee dark bread and honey. very nice toasty aroma. the finish has a crisp effect with subtle floral and earthy notes from the hops. subtle notes of fall spices graham crackers and dried fruit also.  taste: its very balanced and tasty. for 6.1% abv its very easy to drink. the flavors mirror the nose. up front its malty malty malt ball city with earthy undertones. the beer is malty through and through however the finish is somewhat drying and mildly bitter. i also get lingering semi-sweet chocolate and raisin notes. before i knew it my glass was almost empty. very drinkable and tasty.  feel: i would say that this is medium bodied with a slightly chewy mouthfeel and finish. it\s a clean beer that is slightly crisp but the maltiness still wants to hang on the palate for a while just to say i\m still here and i still love you.  overall: i have enjoyed many of troegs offerings but im pretty sure that this is the first time that i am having their oktoberfest. i have heard many positive reviews about this beer this season so i decided to pick it up when i saw it available as a single bottle. i enjoyed this quite a bit. at the same time with this amount of age on this beer at three to four months old i dont think that i would want to have more than one or two of these per session. i also wonder how much different this beer tastes when fresher if much at all. this is a solid oktoberfest marzen example that is in-line with the traditional style.  from the bottle: malt: pilsner munich hops: hallertau tradition
5839,Oktoberfest,3.85,pours a burnt amber color with a soapy off-white head. nose is somewhat earthy and sweet hints of roasty malt caramel and toasted brown sugar maybe. flavor is on the money for me. toasty malt foundation subtle hop flavor coming on without bulldozing everything. enough body to let you know that you have a real beer in front of you yet still very drinkable. this is quite good. hope they bring it back next year.
5840,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.06,very intense aroma of banana vanilla and clove thats practically intoxicating on its own. body is thick with a dank cloying sweetness thats filled with juicy banana melon cloves and honey. earthy and pithy very interesting. a great example of a belgian wheat.
5841,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.36,i cant believe i havent reviewed this yet!  pours out a clear straw color that becomes moderately hazy when the yeast is added. remains translucent. capped with a rocky head of snow white foam. excellent retention. barely reduces at all.  nice tart citrus aroma; lemon grapefruit not overly sweet or sour or candied or perfume-like--quite restrained. very wheat-y some green banana hay and a touch of spices.  nice pop of lemon and orange upfront green banana coriander doughy malt hay. vanilla on the finish. clean and crisp.  fluffy and pillowy  dry extremely drinkable.  world class witbier. i cant believe this is only rated an 85?!?? this set the benchmark for the style. its flawless. its a perfect witbier.
5842,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,2.27,my girlfriends roommate gave me a bottle of this after she told me she didn’t like it. always interesting to have a beer given for free because it was “so bad”. this should be a treat.  look: standard witbier look  smell: strangely enough this smells exactly like sweet corn.  taste: unfortunately it tastes like it smells and it tastes like canned sweet corn juice. not a pleasant taste.  feel: feel isn’t horrible for what it is.  overall it is hard to get past the smell and taste of straight sweet corn. i’m not sure how this is 85/100.
5843,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.13,for a large productive brewery this is genuinely one of the better beers. love the white gold hazy colour. extremely drinkable and refreshing on palate. fresh orange and good carbonation. cannot fault and a few of these babies go down great on a summer evening.
5844,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.85,if it is summer time. hit this again and again. easy on the pallette. great to bring or drink at occasions. looks nice in a small glass. remember your getting 11.2 ounces so they go quick. as another had said..life is too short to drink beer water .this will be a treat for all at the next bbq. goes well with anything really but seafood even better. with the hint of orange peel. this one will have you hitting the head often. so make sure to have a glass of water now and again. you will thank me in the morning. it makes for great conversation. the monks dont fonk around . you need not be a beer snob. but there is no reason to drink bud coors miller. when you can go to the road less traveled. without breaking the piggy bank.
5845,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.42,750ml bottle in mae kasa thailand. pours a hazy mid-gold with a white head. aroma of orange and herb. flavour of coriander orange wheat. nicely balanced.  a classic wheat beer
5846,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,5,amazing!
5847,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,4.75,less maple and coffee presence compared to standard kbbs but more spirit-forward on the nose and palate by way of the barrel. is it better than regular kbbs? yes. it is significantly better? no. essentially kbbs reserve cuts out some of the gas station coffee effect from regular kbbs and delivers a more well-rounded beer. it was a great beer that did not live up to the hype.
5848,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,5,kbbs on steroids. maple and bourbon. perfect heat and sweeet. this is near perfection. it will age perfectly also. i need all of this i can get. boom
5849,Lagerbier Hell,4.25,a particularly mild sparkling long stored beer refreshing and easily digestible at the same time. uniquely in its taste a benefit for each beer connoisseur.  clear golden liquid white foam cap  malty  sweet grains  good helles
5850,Lagerbier Hell,4.52,500ml bottle - pours a pale honey/straw colour with foamy 1.5 finger head. aroma is subtle bready malt and a little bit earthy. taste pretty much follows the aroma however the sweet maltiness is intensified and leaves a very nice sweet finish that lingers. looks and tastes great an exceptional beer.
5851,Lagerbier Hell,3.94,creamy mellow and light. light floral aroma. not too sweet at all for a helles. slight grassy herbal notes. straw gold lager lovely feel. no problem with this at all.
5852,Lagerbier Hell,3.69,poured from a 500ml bottle.  pours light straw coloured with minimal visable carbonation and a tight bubbled white head that leaves a nice amount of lacing . the smell is vague  malty and grassy and not very strong. the taste is full but mellow  a pleasant bitterness throughout with citric acid  grass and straw . the mouthfeel is pretty good  not greasy or water  good middle ground here. overall this is a good beer but  for me at least  not a great one . the citric acid was a little overpowering and (where i live) i can get beer i prefer in this style for cheaper . nevertheless a pleasant beer  id drink it again .
5853,Lagerbier Hell,4.83,crystal clear pale straw colour with a white head. huge sweet malt on the nose. honey dough lightly toasted bread and clean lemon citrus hops. the taste follows exactly. super clean super light perfectly balanced and with a long sweet finish. outstandingly drinkable but with enough going on to be interesting. uniquely refreshing hops character and uniquely complex malt profile for such a light beer. cant say enough good things about it. a perfect lager probably the best in the world and certainly the benchmark by which all other helles must be measured.
5854,Lagerbier Hell,4.25,got one from bières cultes châtelet. an excellent beer of this style with malt back and strong smell of freshly cut grass. excellent beer!
5855,Lagerbier Hell,4.64,grabbed a 05l bottle at the local liquor store type place called benz in sindelfingen. crazy to think how long i’ve wanted to drink this specific beer as helles is one of my favorite styles. also crazy to think that this bottle was just over €1! and yep can confirm this is just about as good as it gets for a helles. crisp clean and a delicious flavor and finish. worth the wait.
5856,Lagerbier Hell,4.38,mostly clear golden pour with two fingers of white foam and plenty of lacing. honeyed grains with grassy hops german yeast and flowers in the nose. taste is much the same but now dial back the flowers and add lemon zest and cracker. feel is crisp clean lighter for style but never thin hops are sneaky shaping though not as much as the malt.
5857,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.94,appearance: clear light gold lively carbonation and fine 1 head that retains and actually laces for a while until retreating to a thin ring of foam.  aroma: sweet white wine and corn syrup. moderate alcohol smell.  flavor: sweet white wine and corn syrup. alcoholic in the way that nyquil is. sweet oily finish.  mouthfeel: light-medium high co2 and rather smooth and not hot for the abv  overall: not bad for what it is.
5858,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,1.97,710ml can tried at a tasting:  cooked vegetable. grape. syrupy sweetness.  d- / avoid
5859,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,3,40oz bottle from the local get rid of your dts shop. i walked past multiple (shaking) people looking for the cheapest malt liquor money can buy. i was also factoring in the alcohol-to-price ratio but alas it wasn\t needed: the cheapest beer also had the most alcohol. a foil labeled 40 called side pocket high gravity  getting back i notice its from wisconsin so my expectations are raised slightly. those sconnies know their beer. i didnt pour it into a glass because im not a heathen. was expecting to have to chase swigs of it with bites of leftover pizza but the taste actually isnt that bad. its overly sweet and corny but i was expecting that. no hint of alcohol except in the mouthfeel and in the burps and i actually taste hops!  buy this. beer make you drunk
5860,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.49,poured from a clear 40 oz. bottle. has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of very light malts not a lot there. taste is alcohol malts hints of green apples and tobacco. feels light in the mouth and overall not the worst malt liquor i have ever had but pretty damn lousy.
5861,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.57,very typical clear gold with minimal head and no retention or lacing. rousing carbonation that settled after a bit.  the usual high gravity lager smells...corn and metallic.  taste was more of the same..sweet alcoholic and fairly smooth. best when cold.  mouthfeel was a step above water.  just another cheap beer for a hot summer evening..i bought it out of sheer curiosity and because i really needed a quick buzz after a rough day.
5862,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.85,40 oz bottle poured into juice glass. no brown paper bag present.  looks like carbonated urine.  it tastes and smells remarkably similar to a very cheap white wine. theres not a lot of bitterness its all just corn and alcohol.  plenty of alcohol in the aftertaste. smooth enough though.  hello friend. would you like to get very drunk? drink this.
5863,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,1.79,40 oz bottle. 1000th review.  straight form the bottle (though i poured most of it for someone else). it pours a deep gold with a fluffy white head that dissipates moderately quickly.  smells like corny mead. lots of honey and alcohol and caorn in the scent.  the flavor is pretty shitty. on the front end it isnt bad mild grain and hops but on the back end it is adjuncty and sickly sweet.  the mouthfeel is prickly at first then seems watery.  this is just a malt liquor contract brewed by a nearly anonymous and small marketing agency. who knows it might share recipes with other or just have a minor tweak it is run of the mill.
5864,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,3.2,40oz bottle in a paper bag generally contributed by joshuaseresse. this is the last of the malt liquors left over from the malt liquor tasting earlier this summer. served in a cantillon glass - hows that for cognitive dissonance?  a - a finger of white foam settles to a thick collar but no lace. there are streams of tiny bubbles rising throughout the dark urine-colored body.  s - grape juice fructose caramel grain light fusel alcohol when it warms up but not too bad for the style.  t - sugar corn white grape juice cereal grains. alcohol is surprisingly well-hidden although this verges on cloying sweet after a few ounces.  m - lower carbonation medium-bodied some grain to the texture and moderate alcohol warmth in the finish.  d - this is actually pretty solid and one of the better takes on the style that ive had. this one is a little bit too sweet for me to tackle the whole 40oz bottle. not quite as good as stack as this one is lower in alcohol but doesnt taste any better.
5865,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.28,appearance: pours a clearish golden-toned body with a frothy short-lived white head.  smell: sweet-scented chemically aroma of cooked corn boiled apple cores and melted sugars.  taste: starts off sweet with tastes of substandard grains and sugar-dosed corn meal. hint of fruitiness somewhat reminiscent of apples. as with so many (okay almost all) of these malt liquors it has that troubling potentially-flammable chemical taste to it. finishes near-hot sweet and chemical coated.  mouthfeel: light-bodied. medium carbonation.  drinkability: ugh. about as bad as any other malt liquor so if nothing else these things are fairly consistent. the name does at least suit the beverage.
5866,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,1.51,the can identified the beer as an ale of the high gravity variety. i am unsure about its veracity but what can i do? onward!  i briefly got a finger of bone-white head before it dissipated into nothingness. color was a deep golden-amber with ne-quality clarity. nose was ungodly sweet underlain by a sharp alcohol quality. i remain suspect about this being an ale. mouthfeel was medium with a very sugary taste on the tongue and suddenly it hit me - this tasted like colt 45 an american malt liquor which is a lager-style. who\s zoomin\ who here? i am going to leave it simply because the can read ale and i am in no position to argue. the finish had a unpleasant tobacco taste like i was sniffing around an ashtray. ooof. the really bad part is that it came in a 24-ounce can and i hated to do a drain pour. i didn\t with chelada a recent f and i chose to bravely press on. awful.
5867,Picture If You Will...,5,i cant imagine a pumpkin beer being any better than this one ...  schlafly makes the best seasonal offering ever year.... this is as if you took that beer...aged it in bourbon barrels...and then sipped it while strolling through a dusty dank october graveyard...  freaking amazing offering....  amazing...  cloves and earth and pumpkin and cinnamon and booze and october...
5868,Picture If You Will...,4.36,2019 release. received from @2beerdogs. poured from 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. it pours a murky opaque dark cola color with a thin light khaki head and lacing. it has a very aromatic nose with all the expected spices: cinnamon nutmeg clove ginger and perhaps a whiff of allspice. i also smell vanilla graham cracker and raisin. the taste largely follows the nose; it does a great job of simulating pumpkin pie. the bourbon is noticeable but soft and warming. there is also a significant bitterness that i attribute to the generous amount of pumpkin meat used in the boil. the taste is big and bold. it boasts an excellent mouth feel: rich viscous and creamy with a higher level of carbonation than i anticipated. the abv on the bottle is 12.88% which is higher than in the ba description. i suspect it varies from year to year. overall anyone who enjoys a pumpkin ale brewed with real pumpkin as opposed to a simple spiced ale should really enjoy picture if you will. this is my first offering from bottle logic and its memorable.
5869,Picture If You Will...,4.1,this is a good one like doc holliday’s chick keeping her eye on his gambling chips. yeah it’s nice like the first day of winter snow before it turns all muddy and gray like life does when things linger for too long. hell i don’t know. i’m just going to drink it and feel alive.  to feel alive...
5870,Picture If You Will...,4.26,2017 bottle. pours black with quickly dissipating head. the nose is cinnamon nutmeg pumpkin vanilla not much bourbon. taste - vanilla cinnamon some bourbon chocolate bread pumpkin cherries a bit of almonds and a touch of burnt wood. this one is quite thick and creamy on the mouthfeel. a lovely beer if you are into pumpkin flavors.
5871,Picture If You Will...,4.27,received from @2beerdogs in nbs bif 10 – thanks derek! reviewed 12/15/19. no date other than “release 2019”. stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. it should have been stored according to the bottle at or below 40 degrees. appearance – 3.5. first pour – light amber slight haze. body – dark brown opaque. when held to direct light translucent at the top. head – large (maximum 5.5 cm aggressive center pour) light tan high density average retention diminishing to a three mm crown and a thin cap. lacing – none – as expected at 11.8% abv. aroma – 4 - typical pumpkin pie spices are present but nutmeg blended with bourbon is predominant. flavor – 4.5 – the flavor doesn’t actually begin at the beginning – to my taste it’s first noticeable on the post-swallow aftertaste. then it’s blended spices with ginger and cinnamon being muted and nutmeg and clove being distinct. allowing a mouthful to warm closer to body temperature it’s prickly carbonation and spicy bourbon. no alcohol (11.8 % abv as stated on label) flavor or aroma although a distinct transitory gastric warming occurs. no diacetyl no dimethylsulfide no malt no hops. palate – 4 - full creamy soft but lively carbonation. final impression and summation: 4.5. appearance is unremarkable – basically looks like any other pumpkin beer or at least any pumpkin stout. the aroma is an above-average blend of bold pumpkin pie spices and anxiously awaited bourbon. flavor is balanced-spice-dominated with the anticipated bourbon slinking about the background like the xenomorph grabbing dallas in the ventilation shaft. palate is pleasing.
5872,Picture If You Will...,4.33,dark brown appearance with tan head that dissipates quickly. aroma is prominent cinnamon and pumpkin. taste is also a cinnamon and pumpkin that is a little harsh. more aging may help.
5873,Picture If You Will...,4,500 ml bottle poured into a teku glass.  dense murky reddish brown with a half inch off-white head.  nose: strong dose of pumpkin pie spice along with an odd sweet floral/spice component that i can’t quite place clove maybe? graham cracker comes through a bit as it warms. not getting much of the barrel.  taste: cinnamon and nutmeg up front. much stronger bourbon presence. a touch of heat on the finish. good flavor profile but i don’t necessarily get pumpkin per se versus just a collection of spices.  feel: medium body medium carbonation.
5874,Hop 15,4.03,slightly hazy orange amber look. has the classic west coast dipa basics. citric and piney smell with taste of the malt sweetness. piney resinous and grapefruit flavors linger. thicker and sweeter feel and taste than i would like. minimal carbonation and not overpowering bitterness. i’m a pizza port fan from s.d. this is a beer to pair with dinner or lunch but at 11% abv you’re better off doing it closer to bedtime!
5875,Hop 15,3.94,september 19th 2015 - ports 15 double hop is a no frills no thrills double ipa. clean and consistent this is like the sierra nevada pale ale of dipas and i love it. the color is a nice orange marmalade shade with a generic ipa smell and its not even especially hoppy. but the flavor is where that brilliant familiarity lies. balanced good hops and a clean taste balanced on a comfortable body this is a great beer to pair with food.
5876,Hop 15,4.05,from the large can it pours a clear amber with a modest head but leaves lacing as you enjoy it. in the nose it is solidly hops. in the mouth the same. it is a classic west coast ipa.
5877,Hop 15,4.17,poured on draft.  pours a lightly hazy golden amber color with a finger of creamy white head. the head leaves some cobwebs of lacing before settling into a ghostly thin sheet.  the aroma brings loads of pineapple and grapefruit as well as some orange and honeydew melon. the pine cones through in the back.  the flavor brings grapefruit pineapple and caramel malts followed by a bitter piney finish. classic west coast right here.  the feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. smooth yet a touch syrupy and sticky. alcohol is definitely present.  overall a great dipa that punches you in the dick with hops yet has plenty of sweet malt for balance. would drink again.
5878,Hop 15,4.31,19.2 oz can from winooski beverage vermont. stamped on the bottom freshest by 12/17/2019. this was poured into a tulip. the appearance was a ruddy burnt amber bronze color with a level foamy white head slowly dissipating to leave some wispy messy lace. the aroma seemed to lead with a blend that reminded me of honeydew coated biscuits. some light dry citrus rind underneath with an ever so slight whiff of clean laundry. some floral hops lean in further underneath. the flavor dryly took the sweetness and met it with an ample bitterness. mellow aftertaste of biscuit malts floral hops and some honeydew. the mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. the abv might be high in this one but it seems like the brewer was able to combine well enough to not let the abv overtake in any sort of way. some smoothness running along my tongue. carbonation felt good like a west coast styled dipa. finishes with some malty sweetness but slightly sticky and dry floral hop bitterness. overall not sure why people cant distinguish between west coast styled dipas and new england styled ones but those of out there loving on a great west coast styled dipa you should seek this out.
5879,Hop 15,4.27,yikes! 19.2 oz. can. 11.0% abv. freshest by 12/17/20 moderate to vigorous pour yields a 3/4 inch creamy white head over a fairly bright golden body with sticky lacing. nose of citrus pine sap and slight damp bud. taste mirrors nose with a malt character and pine bitterness throughout. bitterness is not too much but it is surely up front and personal. nice feel and overall abv is not too well hidden and i wont be driving anywhere tonight. hey pick one up lose your car keys and you wont be disappointed. cheers!
5880,Hop 15,4.59,bright yellow gold mostly filtered with little carbonation topped with 3 fingers of white head.  smells of dope green leaf fresh hop cones pineapple and citrus candy.  tastes of dope green leaf hop cones pineapple and tropical jello.  medium syrupy body with little carbonation.  i got this in redding where i am enjoying it july 19th 2019. excellent brew.
5881,Extra Dry,2.13,696ml (???) clear glass bottle nabbed at bottle mart port douglas australia.  insipid hitting on 6-row and a faint corn-like adjunct note but nothing else. stupidly simple with a neutral flavour but id stop short of calling it watery...it does have body.  i guess this is a beer i\d pair with overly spicy thai food or atomic hot buffalo wings but only then because i wouldn\t be wasting a beer with actual flavour.  d / not recommended
5882,Extra Dry,2.17,tooheys extra dry or teds as theyre colloquially known in australia is a well known mass produced adjunct lager that had its heyday in the early to mid 2000s. originally brewed at 5% its alcohol content has decreased significantly to 4.4%. once a popular beer amongst teenagers and young adults looking for a quick easy buzz it was marketed as an easy drinking lager and gained notoriety with music festivals and outdoor events. nowadays its less popular and tooheys are attempting to revive it by playing on its declining popularity with a marketing campaign of being proudly ordinary.  look: standard aussie mass produced adjunct lager look to it. golden hue medium size head soap sudsy looking which disappated quickly to a white bubbling slick. its an aussie lager it looks pretty standard.  smell: classic aussie adjunct lager smell. grainy faint fruity hop aroma. bready yeast a little chemically almost like a citrus air freshener. a little bit of egg white.  taste: sweet maltiness slight fruitiness. not overly bitter. light graininess . the dryness lingers in the palate and tastes a bit chemically. quite bland even for an aussie adjunct lager.  feel: light refreshing when ice-cold highly carbonated. tastes like a beer that youre going to knock back several of without really caring about what youre drinking. youre drinking it for the buzz it will eventually give you if you knock back enough of them.  overall: i like many australians drank a fair bit of this back in the day when we were young dumb and thinking we were cool. i remember many a headache afterwards and associated nasty hangovers with this stuff. i must say it certainly isnt as good as it once was and the fact that tooheys are advertising it as proudly ordinary is really all that needs to be said about teds. its an ordinary beer. nothing fancy its not trying to be stylish. its there to serve a purpose and not to be savoured. although i dont know how much longer than can keep marketing this when they keep knocking down the abv. its going to be mid-strength the way its going before too long following in the footsteps of the carlton cold.
5883,Extra Dry,2.94,its crisp dry finish is achieved by an extended fermentation ensuring minimal residual fermentable sugars. wonderful fruity malty notes accompany a mellow middle palate leaving a clean aftertaste.
5884,Extra Dry,1.79,one of the worst beers i have ever drank was a task to finish. would not recommend.
5885,Extra Dry,2.78,format: a clear 345ml bottle with a transluscent label. looks okay.  appearance: pours an amber-golden colour with bubbling carbonation. a thin half-finger of head drops to a thin film and ring. limited lacing.  aroma: pretty typical lager with light hops and light cereal adjunct grains. okay.  taste: pretty much follows the nose. this comes across as being a beer that is designed to be put away quickly without thinking about it too much.  aftertaste: light cereal grains here again without much bitterness.  mouth feel: light in feel with medium to higher carbonation. clean and crisp.  overall: an okay macro lager but there are better even at this price range at au$40 a case.
5886,Extra Dry,2.37,malty little floral yeasty after taste
5887,Tripel,4.25,very nice tripel. allagash quality. not necessarily special but really good.
5888,Tripel,3.25,bottled 3/30/23; drank 9/6/23 @ the yarchives.  mostly opaque bright orange/yellow appearance.  a slow pour yielded a nice white head; strong lacing remained.  skunk spray banana dry grass & fresh flower notes in the nose.  skunk spray banana dry wheat & mild booze heat flavors.  this was stored cold when i bought it but who knows what happened before then...ill have to try it again to make sure this hadnt gone bad but for now i must rate it as a skunky odd tripel.
5889,Tripel,4.23,poured from a bottle into a pint glass appearance – the beer pours a very lightly hazed yellow-amber color with a small head of white foam. the head fades rather fast leaving a bit of streaky lace on the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma is quite heavy of a yeasty and spicy aroma with lots of coriander and clove. along with these smells comes a rather strong showing of banana and bubblegum as well as orange and candied sugar. notes of white pepper and a rather decently strong doughy smell are there as well and with a touch of hay and grass a sweet and inviting aroma is produced overall. taste – the taste stars out with a sweet candied sugar orange and banana flavor mixed with some grape juice and a sweet doughy taste. at the same time the spice that was in the nose is well represented in the tongue with flavors of coriander and clove as well as some light white pepper and lemongrass. at the taste advances the sweetness gets slightly stronger all while the doughy flavor takes on more of a cracker malt taste; drying things out a touch. at the same time a yeastiness becomes more pronounced as well. toward the end the spice gets more intense and is joined by some lemon and a bit of hay leaving one with a sweeter but very pleasant taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is crisp with a higher carbonation level and lots of prickly carbonation bubbles. for the style the feel is fantastic and makes for a nice sipper. overall – a quite nice triple that is big on sweetness but still very drinkable and pleasurable. quite nice.
5890,Tripel,4.68,like most of allagashs beers outstanding. the strong ale is full-on flavor banana and other spices and a great beer. will definitely buy again and again.
5891,Tripel,4.53,pours golden yellow with faint white cap in mini tulip. notes of clove and spice make this a really nice tripel at 9% abv.
5892,Tripel,4.39,classic belgian esters and slight banana and clove. great belgian!
5893,Tripel,5,i have tried this one out of a big bottle with a cork it poured nice golden color smelled like honey and almonds also had a very nice carbonation flavor of clean golden triple apricot and finishes up with a little bit of that pine bitterness is at the end.
5894,Tripel,4.28,pours an awesome 3 finger head with lots of lacing down the glass. a but musty and metallic on the nose is the only drawback. taste is fantastic and clean with some nice soft belgian candi and no aftertaste. the drinkability rivals any true belgian you can find. soft and light tasting but flavorful and strong. this is one damn good beer!
5895,Tripel,4.5,minimal belgian yeast character when cold but the esters show up as it warms however never overdone.
5896,Tripel,4.36,tripel pours a clean crisp gold with a modestly sized lacing head. the aroma is filled with clove and banana. the flavor is rich sweet and sugary candy-like with cloves and bananas. good body and feel. overall lots of flavors sweeter and brighter.
5897,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.75,feel like ive been reading about this beer for so long and when i was recently at haymarket bridgman it happened to be on tap! lived up to the hype; great barrel character lot of chocolate and bursting with berries. glad i was finally able to try it.
5898,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.24,12 ounce can into a snifter. canned 1/18/22 had 9/3/22.  pours near black and opaque oily looking with a brief head and a little oily lacing. aromas of bourbon roasted malt raspberries vanilla some oak and char. flavors of bourbon raspberries roasted malt vanilla light oak. smooth a little creamy a very good full body appropriately carbonated.  very enjoyable. the raspberries show well there’s a nice roasted base and the barrels are lighter but good. have had this on draft and at events over the years and this wasn’t quite as good. a  r033115 0450
5899,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.03,2022 version poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. im not typically a big fan of fruit stouts but id heard good things about this beer and it didnt disappoint. lightly tart fruit.
5900,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.53,untappd backlog from 10/12/2019.
5901,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.04,the last thing i expected to be at fobab was an old whale i never thought i would tick but here we are and im so happy!  despite all that i can settle myself and dig in. as i do here in this 8 ball black short mocha headed ale i get chocolate raspberry sticks and not a ton of barrel. theres just a little bite of slightly herbal wood which i think more than anything helps to bring us to a powder dry finish.  i can see how this would have made the news in its heyday (see what i did there?) but in todays world of absolute confections and bombastic feats of oak its quite underwhelming.
5902,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.43,can courtesy of johnnyhops.
5903,Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.36,part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @fbarber during nbs bif #13.  gorgeous pour. body traps light. completely dark. lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. quite the beaut.  nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough theres a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. inviting.  the berries are much more prevalent here beginning at the first sip. it starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components i will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. well come back to this later. the build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. this brings us back to the raspberry. you know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? its one of the great things about them is they offer a balance and a range of experience and that presents here. the finish has some bitter from the coffee and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little ooh! to the finish. really enjoyable.  body is velvety smoothe and that tart finish i descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. would not descibe it as hot but it isnt shy about its double digit abv.  im really enjoying this. raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing but i feel like i still dont see it quite as often as id expect in beer. i think it really really works well here and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. thanks frank!
5904,Sofie,4.51,slightly hazy gold big white head that recedes quickly slippery lace citrus herbal peppery and soft malt aroma tastes like it smells with a bit of vanilla citrus impact is great- its more orange than orange without tasting fake light bodied with excellent carbonation really great
5905,Sofie,3.41,at the ohare airport on the way to boston  looks great yellow slight haze. smells like a belgian but with a fruity edge. tastes much better when poured out. i dont really taste the orange peel but lots of coriander and belgian yeast flavor. a lemon tang and silky smooth yeasty goodness. still not a fan of goose islands belgian stuff.  babys first belgian
5906,Sofie,4.07,on tap at the clybourne brewpub  next stop goose island. continuing on with my chicago beer escapade i just had to stop at this legendary brewery for some good beers here and to go. let’s see what their classic saision is all about  pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  there’s not much funk or tartness to the nose as i tend to prefer in the style but the earthy vibe is still quite nice. i’m picking up on aromas of white pepper lemon zest white tea crackery malt tannic white wine wildflower honey pear skin and earthy wheat  likewise in taste it is more just straight earth than funk and again still good. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting lemon zest crackery malt wildflower honey white tea peppery hops apple skin and light toast. the swallow brings notes of clove bready malt white grape honey peppery hops pear skin and a touch of vanilla  a light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a crisp and sharp beer. finishes mostly dry and refreshing  this is a nice well rounded saison. nothing to seek out but good nonetheless
5907,Sofie,3.98,fairly light with a touch of funkiness and bitterness. more bitter than i expected but that may also be the citrus peel. excellent aroma.
5908,Sofie,4.02,this is a 12oz. bottle poured into the goose island pint glass. this brew is slightly hazy a light yellow with a slight orange tint when held up to the light. there is an abundant amount of carbonation to watch parade to the top. the half inch of fluffy white head did recede to a thin cap after several minutes. the aroma is quite noticeable from a distance. for starters there is a sweet fruity citrus i am leaning toward notes of orange. there is a pleasant yeast and wheat mixture happening also. the wheat is the first thing i am picking up a little yeast then the orange peel. the finish is slightly bitter a tad dry with a bump of pepper spice. this is an easy drinker not heavy a medium smooth feel.
5909,Sofie,4.14,pours a bronzish gold minimal lacing. slightly funky scent with orange background. slightly funky slightly tart mildly citrus. lighter body especially for a barrel aged beer. good but light.
5910,Sofie,3.12,a saison found the day after saison day. better late but unfortunately this was the only one available. two brown twelve ounce bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. its a light amber liquid really not much different in color than most lagers. there is a bit more opaqueness than lagers generally have. a nice modest and enduring white head is included. the glass lacing is even less. the smell is vaguely yeasty and perhaps a little perfume-llke. the taste is yeasty and perfume-llke but mildly refreshing. it certainly is much lighter in feeling and taste than an ipa. not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing. orange peel is included in the mix. its there but not a heavy influence on the taste. probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish. that part is well done for without it this could be a yeasty mess. theres no evidence this has an abv above five percent other than to read it on the label. probably average for the style this isnt going to convert a hop loving dipa devotee. yet for a once a year change it wasnt such a terrible thing.
5911,Sofie,4.65,good tasting saison great flavor!
5912,Balaton,4.41,dark brown in color with a murky complexion. i smell barnyard funk horse blanket and dark cherries. i taste dark malt tart cherries and barnyard funk. the mouth is dry and crisp.
5913,Balaton,4.32,blend #2 unsure of the year  we’ve arrived (far too soon) at my last beer from my recent trade with merpunk1. this is the highest rated oud bruin on ba and the combination of chambourcin barrels and cherries has me excited to try it. it’s also pretty cool that it’s only 5% so i imagine it will drink very easily  pours a dark reddish brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  there’s a decent amount of complexity going on in the nose on this one given that some of these can be one-dimensionally tart. i’m picking up on aromas of tart black cherry dates red wine vinegar sweet red grape toffee brown bread and a touch of cinnamon  the tartness is really forward in taste but the complexity is still awesome. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting black cherry chewy grape brown bread sharp oak and light cinnamon. the swallow brings notes of tart black cherry candy red wine toffee dates and a touch of leather  a light medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp and tart beer. finishes lightly sticky but still retains enough tartness to keep it from being cloying  this is delicious stuff. man i really wish i had easier access to side project beers they make truly fantastic stuff
5914,Balaton,4.48,a 375ml bottle blend #2 poured into a tilquin stemmed glass.  appearance: a dark maroon almost cola colour with a half finger pinkish tanned head that dissipated quickly to a ring around the glass while leaving only sparse lacing.  aroma: sweet dessert cherry pie cherry almond berry yoghurt caramel.  taste: sweet sour and tart cherry almond caramel cinnamon oak with acidic notes especially on the finish.  mouthfeel: medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  overall: absolutely wonderful aroma and while taste was enjoyable it wasn’t as amazing as the aroma.
5915,Balaton,4.39,pours a bloody-burgundy-ruby with a finger of off white foam that bubbles away quickly. aroma is rich dark cherry tart green apple plum and a little cellar stone at the base. tangy twist is well defined and melded into the profile. flavor profile is dark cherry cellar stone grassy herbal plums and figs. initial profile is a burst of tangy sour that recedes to reveal a lightly sweet finish. mouth feel is crisp and medium-thin. overall lovely dark cherry qualities wrapped up into a mild tangy and sour ale. remarkable.  served in a 12oz side project tulip from a 375ml bottle. blend #2.
5916,Balaton,4.02,cherry and tart. little hint of cinnamon.
5917,Budweiser 66,2,had that one time at a party back in the day. i have had a wicked lot of beers from these guys most of which are not at all good whatsoever this included.
5918,Budweiser 66,1.8,a 300ml clear glass bottle with a bb of march 2013. the label states that it is brewed in the uk and describes it as lightly carbonated with a smooth easy taste. sounds like bollocks to me.  poured into a straight pint glass. a clear pale straw colour with light carbonation. a hard pour results in a large head of white foam that disappears rapidly. aroma of almost nothing; initially some faint malt and little else. as it warms unwelcome hints of stewed corn and sulphur appear. gross.  tastes of ultra-light malt with a faint sweetness. no hops or bitterness whatsoever. this could well be the most flavourless beer ive ever tried. mouthfeel is thin and watery with a mild tingly dryness. no body - could pass as mineral water. a weak aftertaste of stewed veg.  crap. this has to be the blandest most characterless brew ever to pass my lips. almost no taste a weak and unpleasant aroma and no body or depth. just bad on every level. avoid at all costs!
5919,Budweiser 66,1.22,a - very pale yellow with absolutely no head at all. a couple of tiny bubbles rising to the surface too but not many.  s - hardly any smell at all mainly a very faint sweet smell but bland for the most part.  t - very bland again for the most part although it finishes with a sugary sweet kind of taste.  m - very light bodied & smooth going down with very little carbonation.  d - this beer has absolutely no taste other than a very faint sugar like finish & the fact that there was no head at all when i poured it suggests it should be avoided. it tastes so much like water than i wouldnt even call it beer.  more reviews at: http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com/
5920,Budweiser 66,1.09,this beer is brewed for the uk market only (i am lead to believe) god knows where it is actually produced.  clear 300ml bottle the cap already promised to a ba in the us. jermsumm gets it in my next package.  the brew number is a special one it means something to a lot of british people which is obviously why bud choose 66.  when a brit hears the number 66 it reminds him of different things depending on age and education. 1066 the battle of hastings where we defeated an invading french army: 1666 the great fire of london 1966 when england won the football world cup for the first and only time or the iconic route 66 from chicago to la: however a number between 65 and 67 is what itll mean to most who buy this beer (if they can count that high).  i poured the beer into a hoegaarden crand cru stemmed tulip glass to give it some class (this failed to have the desired effect).  it looked like a regular lager/pilsner/helles golden clear clean and bright. the white head leaving before it had fully arrived a trait i hate.  youll not be suprised to hear the beer had very little aroma or taste in fact it reminded me of fizzy water such was its characterless gassy flavourless make-up. perhaps im being unkind here hey no im not this beer is terrible to the core (if it had a core to be terrible too).  there was a mini hint of sweetness from something but i couldnt detect any hop malt or yeast involvement what-so-ever it this so called brew. most likely the worst beer ive ever reviewed since joining this site.  my son-in-law bought me this on his first anniversary of his marriage to my daughter cant wait for next years treat!
5921,Perpetual IPA,4.32,l - golden with some clarity along with an off-white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing s - piney hops along with tropical fruit notes honey and malt - smell is faint t - follows the nose: piney bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with notes of citrus - orange and grapefruit - with a good amount of malt to balance out any bitterness some honey and caramel as well f - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. soft and smooth o - a nicely balanced west coast ipa
5922,Perpetual IPA,4.43,draught very thick and lasting white head bubbling like crazy. medium dark gold with a slight orange highlight for the look. balanced floral citrus peel and medium toasted and caramelized malt aroma. very smooth and balanced floral mixed citrus peel with a good amount of creamy medium toasted malt to provide balance flavor and mouthfeel. very good.
5923,Perpetual IPA,2.2,i\m from northern california visiting mother in outside of philly and thought it would be fun to introduce her to ipas vs the leffe (belgian abbey) and pilsner urquell which she\s familiar with. i grabbed a 5 varietal 15-pack off the state store shelf (pa). i\m sorry i did. bland would be the description of this ale. and that came from my 85-year old mother. (hey i\m a good son and bought her a 12-pack of pilsner urquell so the trip to the state store wasn\t a total waste)
5924,Perpetual IPA,4.85,our afterwork beersnob party in the horticultural center break room started with this most excellent ipa going on to seven other really good ipas from all over. hard to accurately compare that many different fine tastes in sequence but the perpetual imperial is so incredibly outstanding that its hard to imagine any ipa would taste better. for sure i want this brew occupying a steady and always stocked space on my chilled beer shelf!
5925,Perpetual IPA,4.29,pours a medium golden with white head. some citrus on the nose. sticky pine sap and citrus all the way. this is a classic west coast flavor profile. it lingers somewhat but not enough for you to feel underwhelmed on subsequent sips. a touch of resin on the finish sticks to your tongue. this is a really good ipa.
5926,Perpetual IPA,4.77,central pa’s most iconic beer. you could go to a dive bar and they’d most likely have this on tap along with a couple domestics. the best wcipa made on the east coast right here!
5927,Perpetual IPA,3.75,all the way west coast style. dry but hops are very present and delicious. dry bread taste if you will. malt overtones. decent lacing. i like.
5928,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.29,the pour is amber colored with a moderate amount of carbonation. i get a lot of smoke on the aroma. moreover the smoke is there on the taste as well plus some cherrywood & baked biscuits are in there too. this was a good rauchbier that you should try out if you like this style. there is no date on the bottle. cheers! a-
5929,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.37,(16? oz can no date/code pulled from 4-pack at state line yesterday... poured into my 0.5l unibroue becher glass)  l: deep tawny-colored liquid good clarity; tight aged-white finger-plus high foam pad... a med-thick collar maintains; laces only a little  s: boldly smoky (and woody) in the vein of their other brands but a whole new sugar-concentrated dried-fruity mildly sour-red-ale undertone that nearly matches the smoke in intensity... its really sparking my interest cant wait to drink  t: the (non-smoke) flavors dont quite match the aromas with the suggestion of fruity and sour tones pulling way back allowing a rather densely bread-crusty malt foundation to be front and center (almost like an irish red)... the smoke is bold but not too intense while theres a relatively acidic midtone lingering and even a whisper of earthy hops in the aftertaste  f: med-light bodied and delicately silky in its initial swell... the intensity of the smoke stokes a tingly flame throughout the palate up into the nostrils; my nose feels rosy...  o: quite possibly the most intriguing aromas ive encountered from a rauchbeer... its flavors compliment its color... its taste over time though failed to hold my interest; it begs for a more roasted-nutty delicately-caramelly undertone (2227)
5930,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.13,1pint 0.9oz bottle into a pint glass. no freshness dating but a recent release.  splendid looking beer. deep reddish amber persistent off white head thick rings of lacing. smoky meaty aroma. on tasting there is a light sweetness to offset the smoked pork flavor. clean finish with a featherlight bitter note. another fine smoked beer from aecht schlenkerla.
5931,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.32,poured into a fremont small snifter. pours a medium to dark coppery orange with a one finber light khaki head with great retention and solid lacing. looks great. aroma of pale malt smokehouse smokiness hints of cherry and raisins. flavor is lightly biscuit malt smokehouse smokiness with umami raisins brown bread and mild cherry wood; light bitterness in the finish with residual wood smoke. medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. i wasnt sure how this one would turn out since i liked the bock versions much better than the lighter malt ones; in fact the bock aecht beers are among my favorites. however like their lighter lentenbier the smokiness is tempered a little to fit the malt which has more depth than i expected from the modest abv. the faint cherry notes really added to my enjoyment. when i get a hankering for a rauchbier the urbock and dopplebock are going to be my first choices but i will definitely return to this too. these guys are the smoked beer masters.
5932,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.42,deep brown leather ruby color off white head that leaves thick lacing bands and erratic bubbles on the top. light gets through and can make out my finger for about a foot or two on the other side of the glass. nose is smoke meat cherry jam wood roasted nuts which with the cherry almost make a pb&j note in the nose. taste is malty bread graham cracker cherry smoke meat with a cherry smoke finish. somehow way cleaner on the finish than any of those tastes would suggest. medium body and medium carbonation.
5933,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,3.85,pours a clear mahogany brief fizzy 0.5 light tan head that quickly settles out no retention and very little lacing. nose is beef jerky liquid smoke and leather though not as richly...beefy...as others in the line-up. taste gets most of its smoke from the aroma while on the palate there is a much greater malt sweetness and light caramel. perhaps this sweetness comes from the cherry wood used to smoke but i feel like if the smokiness was peeled away this would taste much like helles. mouthfeel follows in the that vein and it is very drinkable and refreshing despite the umami notes. not my favorite schlenkerla but still very good.
5934,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.33,poured into pint glass. murky amber offwhite head. faint smokey nose.  cherrywood really comes out on the flavor with noasted malt notes. this one isnt as heavy as other offerings from this brewery.  lighter crisper mouthful on this one too.  schlenkerlas lighter smoked beer. nice prelude to autumn this.
5935,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.31,single 0.5l bottle from jungle jims i swear i smell some bacon... smoke has a good presence but certainly not as intense as their original. i like this one a lot!
5936,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.53,fantastic. lighter more crisp rauchbier than their other offerings. i had read reports of a buttery diacetyl mouthfeel and i dont get it this beer is anything but slimy the mf is really what shines on this for me.  the smoke is slightly attenuated compared to the marzen but im not finding it that much different in flavor. ill add some more notes and nuances as i revisit this again.
5937,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.28,cherry wood comes through nicely on this ruby brown beer both in nose and taste. smoke plays in but isn’t too strong and definitely not overpowering. reminds me of an old slightly smoky malt whiskey in flavor profile (without any of the alcohol burn/bite of course). a cherry malty beer with a dose of smoke to make things interesting balanced in a way that works pretty well for me.
5938,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.27,pours a light yellowish brown color looks like a dark reddish-amber in the glass; decent carbonation; thick head dense and sticky with nice sheeting inside the glass. fantastic smoked aroma; gently sweet as the beer opens up; cherry wood smoke. the taste follows along the lines of the smell; mild cherry sweetness like diluted cherry cough drops; wood ash and cherry wood smoke; very mild smokey phenols. medium-heavy body; lightly sticky on the palate.  this phenomenal new beer from brauerei heller-trum should appeal to most fans of their beechwood smoked beers. there is enough similarity to the urbock and märzen yet distinct enough with its light cherry tones.  pouring temperature: 41 °f; bottling info: n/a source: @cstamp3084
5939,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.23,here it is the new schlenkerla beer that has the whole beer community paying attention. well more like a small subset of the ba beer nerds but i digress. i’m quite excited to try this one as i’ve only had one other rotbier before and it was most certainly not smoked. let’s crack it open and see what it has to offer  pours a clear copper with 2 fingers of rocky light beige head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  i was expecting a more subtle smokiness in this one but it’s up front in the nose. i’m picking up on aromas of cherrywood smoke biscuity malt floral hops smoked ham cedar brown sugar black pepper and raisin  the smoke is a bit more subdued in taste but it makes for a balanced beer. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting biscuity malt floral hops beechwood smoke honey black pepper dark bread red berries and light brown sugar. the swallow brings notes of cherrywood smoke biscuity malt earthy hops dark toast brown sugar molasses light raisin and brown sugar  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick beer. finishes neutral with a slight bite that dries it out over time  another winner from schlenkerla. i’m glad i picked uo a 4 pack of this one when i stopped at oec over the weekend as well as the new-to-me kräusen
5940,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.3,fantastic rauchbier as one should expect from aecht schlenkerla. this style at a fairly low abv doesnt lend itself to the strong smoke as well as their more malty offerings; theres just not enough depth and complexity on the palate (although oddly there is a decent amount of sweetness).  the smoke itself is wonderful and you can really pick up the difference from cherry wood than from other smoke choices. the aroma is nothing short of delightful a campfire blending notes of wood smoke meat smoke and dark fruit.  drinks clean and easy with a body a touch thicker than you might expect for the abv but which fits this beer very well.
5941,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,3.23,released summer 2023; drank 7/12/23 @ the yarchives.  see-through dark red appearance.  a rough pour yielded a big khaki head; a thick curtain of frothy tree-rung lace.  bacon smoke & faint berry notes in the nose.  slick mouthfeel.  campfire smoke melted butter & some bacon flavors.  this tasted a bit off...diacetyl notes perhaps? cant say i loved it.
5942,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,4.35,smoky woody deliciousness. reminds of me of smoked sausage. has a little bit of everything breadiness floral notes. really enjoyed this
5943,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.19,330ml bottle into a teku. bottled april 2016 so 7 years old.  dark golden body with a bright white head refreshed by streams of carbonation. sweet malty aroma with fruit hints. taste is sweet smooth and nicely warming.
5944,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.31,bottled and purchased from otters tears an online uk beer store pours a peach coloured body with a couple of white coloured bubbles aroma is full on belgian candy & funkadelica flavour is dry sherry sweet vermouth & pickles
5945,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.45,4-pack of cans from john’s. lots of head even 18 months after canning. opaque dark gold. belgian banana and booze.
5946,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.41,god bless those folks in belgium. this is near perfect. bravo to belgium!
5947,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),3.36,a: golden amber with a slightly off white head.  s; pale make and a bit of fruitiness.  t: clove pale malt and some herbal notes  m: medium thick feel with moderate carbonation.  o: overall not bad but not my favorite example of the style.
5948,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.21,11.2oz bottled sept. 2020 (about 18 months ago) poured into a chalice at 53° fahrenheit 10% abv. the beer pours opaque honey colored amber with very light khaki head. the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of varied sized bubbles leaving just a few small bits of lacing. the aroma is fairly sweet with pale malt berry and peach. the taste is semisweet and a hint tart with well attenuated pale malt hints of berry and melon before a mildly bitter citrus like finish. the mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. no trace of the abv in the aroma and just a touch in the taste. overall very good.
5949,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4,this one was pretty good. seemed to lean more heavily into the fruity ester notes along with a nice malty backbone and some belgian spiciness. enjoyable to drink.
5950,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.24,well what an nice belgium tripel! one of my new favorite tripels. cloudy fruity hints of apricos bananas and citrus. soft- bitterness- well hidden alcohol.
5951,Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.64,l - hazy golden wheat colored pour with a think white head which dissipates to a thin fine laced foam.  s - citrus rind marmalade/stewed apricot dried grassiness.  t - stone fruit with light syrup and a clean medicinal bitterness on the finish.  f - slightly thick and juicy  finishes dry well hidden alcohol.  a very pleasant and well balanced experience not leaning in any particular direction. not too much of anything. unlike most tripels which rely on the orange and coriander.
5952,Punkuccino,3.86,12 oz bottle from the elysian pumpkin mixed 12-pack. poured into a snifter. copper color with a creamy head - almost nitro-like (or cappuccino-like?). aroma and flavor feature pumpkin spice sweet cream caramel malt toffee and bitter (almost burnt) coffee. mouthfeel is excellent very smooth full and creamy. solid overall and if not for the burnt character this would be even better.
5953,Punkuccino,4.19,from a 12oz bottle marked “exp by 06 jan24” poured into a tulip. only the appearance is unremarkable here. dark mahogany but little head and what there is disappears quickly. no lacing. smell and flavor as advertised but thankfully the cinnamon is subtle. abundant pumpkin plus coffee and some vanilla. the lactose additions adds heft to the body. overall a nice twist on a pumpkin ale but not as good as their great pumpkin imperial ale
5954,Punkuccino,3.66,aroma of harsh espresso and juicy pumpkin bar. bodys much the same. an immediate onset of mocha and espresso followed by thick sumptuous pumpkin bar pastry with some chocolate on the side. not bad. not very complex but smooth and straightforward.
5955,Punkuccino,4.72,i know this is elysian and its a popular brewery that was purchased by miller so i heard the name of the beer and the description and honestly thought this beer was a joke. pumpkin coffee stout? come on! this beer is going to be rank. no one can pull this off. oh contraire.  smell is pumpkin but you get undertones of coffee. like a perfect balance. how is that? taste is is equally balanced. nice pumpkinq flavoring without being overpowering or tasting fake. a beer like this has to be so hard to nail down and they did it. standing ovation.
5956,Punkuccino,3.21,super dark brown but not quite black thick tan head excellent retention spotty lace smells like coffee with heavy pumpkin spice tastes like an old pumpkin spice latte that was a little shy on the milk rich medium heavy body appropriately lower carbonation not my thing
5957,Punkuccino,4.19,black coffee color with a decent tan head and bits of nice lacing. the aroma is coffee and pumpkin pie not bad. the taste follows with pumpkin pie leading followed by coffee with a touch of cream very nice. the body is light/ medium light carbonation smooth and very drinkable. altogether this makes for one of the best pumpkin brews i have tried excellent.
5958,Punkuccino,4.2,deep brown not totally opaque though decent head and some minor lacing. a little pumpkin pie on the nose. blackened toast and pumpkin pie flavors are present. lightly carbonated and light feeling. pretty good beer among elysian pumpkin ales this is second best.
5959,Polotmavy,4.5,16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack directly from human robot in jenkintown for $16. this was canned on 08/31/2023 so its just 6 days old!  look: it pours a really pretty dark copper / amber or garnet color. nice clarity. there was a fluffy off-white head of two fingers that slowly dissipated to a thin layer. lots of small bubbles are quickly rising up the glass.  smell: it smells really nice. its malt-forward with toasty dark bread coming through predominantly. there are also nice spice notes of clove anise licorice and root beer. i also get nice notes of molasses cocoa powder and nuttiness (hazelnut). there is a subtle floral and grassy hoppiness on the finish.  taste: so delicious. it mirrors the nose quite nicely. up front its malt forward with warm toasty flavors of chocolate and nuttiness. the finish has a mild earthy and slightly peppery bitterness and while you can tell that the beer has a lot of perceived sweetness it still finishes in a relatively dry and refreshing way.  feel: its very smooth. medium bodied with a nice creaminess even though its only 4.2% abv. it finishes very clean and crisp. nicely carbonated.  overall: i am a big fan of this beer. i had it on tap a few weeks ago at human robot jenkintown with the czech lukr side pull. it doesn\t have the same super-creamy body and head as on draft but it\s very solid in the can at home. it\s so flavorful and so smooth and drinkable. unbelievable that it\s only 4.2% abv. it reminds me of a baby dopplebock. i would drink this all day long.  from the website: subtle yet satisfying. translated as “half dark” this decoction brewed lager has a slight roast flavor from a touch of chocolate malt atop the finest floor malted bohemian pils and dark malts. hopped gently with czech saaz.
5960,Polotmavy,4.07,nice malty dark lager with cocoa notes raisin and roast but mellowed out low alcohol and crushable a really fine example of the style and yet another great lager from these guys courtesy of my brothers generous sharing. medium amber to chestnut color on this rich in tone but light looking in body under a frothy two inches of tan head leaving patchy lace in its wake. the nose is pretty roasty almost more a brown ale malt profile type smell a whisper of leather and soil less caramelized and generically malty sweet than a lot of its peers i like the dryness and i get subtle fruity character here too old world lager yeast is evident. the flavor is identical just a hint of smoke almond and cherrywood fresh mulch dark bread and bran. really flavorful for how light it is and the finishing dryness makes it more drinkable than a lot of these low abv is ideal for these flavors too. european but complex as these go which i do not find to be the style norm and this is one that leans a little autumnal but is most certainly an all season drinker. quality stuff coming out of human robot thankful to have gotten to drink a few would love to check the place out someday seem to have a great thing going!
5961,Polotmavy,4.56,got milktubes?
5962,Polotmavy,4.02,poured from a 16 oz can into a willi becher pint glass. l - pours a deep amber color with a large white head that dissipates slowly. s - smells of bread and spices. t - taste matches the smell malty and spicy. f - medium body and carbonation. o - very tasty dark lager. i could drink these all day.
5963,Polotmavy,4.25,pours a rich brown color that is nearly clear and features an off-white head that provides beautiful lacing straight down the glass. the nose has a substantial chocolate note and some toffee and a nice grassy note as well.  there’s a lot going on with this 4.2% abv beer.  the taste features the chocolate which is absolutely delicious and the toffee is a bit more on the roasty side fitting well with the grassy flavors from the noble hops.  the mouthfeel is crisp perfect for this rich lager that packs a ton of flavor into a little package.
5964,Polotmavy,4.08,clear dark amber body; nice carbonation; thick frothy head off-white color; rocky. fantastic roasted grain aroma; charred maltiness. nice taste; lightly sweet malt flavor with dark overtones; nutty; mild to moderate bitterness; a bit of cocoa. medium-heavy body; slick and silky; fine residual sugar smoothness; overall semi-dryness.  this is a great little dark lager bringing some nice balanced elements to your drinking experience.  pouring temperature: 48 °f; canning data: unknown
5965,Polotmavy,4.02,pours a clear amber color. huge thick pillowy off-white head. really pretty looking beer.  aroma has notes of spicy rye bread grainy malts dark bready malts with light spicy hope notes.  taste follows the nose with notes of grainy malts light rye bread spice spicy hop notes.  feel is light to medium bodied smooth kind of slick. mild carbonation.  overall a really nice czech amber lager.
5966,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.46,bottom line: this is a delectable pastry stout worthy of angry chairs lofty reputation. they simply seem to have mastered some sort of alchemy regarding the style that few if any can match.  its perhaps not a dead ringer for the namesake dessert ... but it honestly isnt far off and the resemblance grows with successive sips. its sweet but not cloying; realistically its more rich and decadent than sweet. the coconut is a lovely light touch never overbearing but adding another layer to the profile. chocolate and vanilla are prominent joined by molasses cherry and caramel from the malt base. incredibly long finish including lingering notes of coffee chocolate and vanilla.  this is another absolute home run from angry chair. every single time i have one of their highest-rated pastry stouts i think theres absolutely no way it can possibly live up to the hype ... and then it not only matches but surpasses the hype.
5967,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.42,from a 32oz crowler filled at the brewery 06/03/23. served in a tulip.  pours a thick-and-viscous appearing motor oil black. a scant quarter-finger of coffee-colored suds lasts a half-minute or so leaving a soft creamy collar and a barely rousable oily sugary film of super-slippery lacing.  nose is roasty-malty nutty and mildly sweet. aromas of fudge and dark roast coffee. some nuttiness and woody husky coconut as it warms.  taste is fudgy-sweet - but much less sweetness than anticipated. tasting brown sugar chocolate vanilla fudge molasses-sweetened coffee and - more prominently and notably as the beer warms - an earthy woody nuttiness ground bitter walnut thick and heavy perfumy vanilla and husky coconut. nice! alcohol is hardly noticeable.  feel is smooth and viscous dense but less thick and heavy than it appeared going into the glass! with super-fine prickly carbonation making it feel a little lighter than it might otherwise. i want to say that it feels ‘sugary’ like sugar water but that’s totally hallucinatory - it tastes like it should feel sugary but it does not. abv is hardly evident.  overall outstanding! i like to buy these sweet and sticky pastry stouts mainly so that i can complain about them and leave bad reviews but this was so damn good that i was wishing i hadn’t offered to share it with boy and spouse. mammosilenus who never likes stouts stole several ounces of this and then came back looking for more and had to be beaten back.
5968,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.53,such an awesome beer! like most of angry chairs stouts this thing coated the glass with sugar making it difficult to hold without developing sticky fingers. this is offset completely by the delicious deep chocolate nose and palette with boozy sweetness grabbing hold and a light aftertaste of vanilla.
5969,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.19,dark black little to no head. imperial german chocolate cupcake stout is super sweet and not my favorite kind of stout. this needs the barrel. its tasty - i split this 4 ways so still got about 6oz and it was probably 3oz too many. total dessert stout. good for what what it is - not for me.
5970,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.5,sampled 11/8/2019 while in line at toppling goliath. chocolate greatness.
5971,Clara Puncheon,4.5,bottle pour gently down the center of a stemmed glass. pale yellow appearance with generous soapy white head that slowly dissipates into a thin sparse layer of lasting surface foam and lacing. soft citrus apple biscuit on the nose and palate. champagne mouthfeel.
5972,Clara Puncheon,4.57,a massive thank you to woolenthusiast for this bottle. thank you so much.  750ml bottle - dated 8/5/2020 - poured into a classic tulip at around 45°f.  pours a beautiful deep amber yellow - brilliantly clear and topped with a thick dense cap of whote foam with excellent retention. theres a central stream of bubbles that continuously feeds the head as some lacing begins to form. very pretty.  nose: despite the low abv there is a remarkably bold deep character to this one. a sweetness is immediately apparent with some dusty grains hay grass and musty old oak. a bright fruity contrast lends notes of pear apple and some soft lemon with some delicate floral notes peeking through and a whisper of herbal character. a pleasing spice character emerges with some coriander seed white pepper allspice and clove and eventually the deep complex mature oaky and wild notes emerge with petrichor dead leaves wet soil farmhouse must and delightful hill magic. truly stunning.  palate: clara puncheon greets the palate with this beautiful harmonious accord of apple pear lemon white grape skin and gooseberry backed by a semi-sweet grainy backdrop like table crackers. that subtle spice element from the aroma quickly appears with lovely coriander seed and just a hint of allspice and clove lending a very belgian-like phenol profile. dusty rustic old hay dry grass damp musty oak fern mineralic well water and earthy damp musty complexity that just reminds me if vermont itself. terroir perhaps. the acidity here is remarkably gentle. very much leaving into the old world belgian saison level of subtle tartness which just allows everything to shine. the finish brings a touch of pithy grapefruit opening into a slight herbal hop note with just a kiss of leafy resin and spice while the fruity notes and juicy tartness fade away revealing a bit more oak and musty earthen tones concluding with a friendly bitter snap.  mouthfeel/body: in typical hill saison fashion the body here is impeccable. soft fluffy and airy - ultra crisp and light but enough plushness and presence behind it. unbelievably quenching but theres enough there to really savour. effervescence is brilliant - soft and lively accented by that well water minerality that gently scrubs the palate. just enough pith and tannins to clean it all up and beg you for the next sip. masterful.  ive yet to have a dud from hill farmstead. shaun is on another level and these raisins truly posses a magical quality. this however is in that upper echelon of truly remarkable saisons really approaching that level of perfection. its flawless. without flaw. this is the definition of hill farmstead and few ales can match this level of enjoyment. a masterpiece.
5973,Clara Puncheon,4.55,this one pours a golden yellow-ish color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells like lemony funk light breadiness a definite minerality pear and apple.  this doesnt taste wildly different than regular clara and im not really convinced its all that different. as it doesnt taste all that different than clara itself its still a tremendous beer with so many little flavor nuances packed into a very low abv body.  this is light bodied clean and super crisp with a fantastic drinkability. taking down a whole 750 is more than easy.  pretty much obviously this is great stuff.
5974,Clara Puncheon,4.33,picked this up last fall and i have been waiting for the perfect day to pop it. seems as good a day as any not a cloud in the sky....75 degrees . worth the wait!
5975,Clara Puncheon,4.45,clear golden with a tall head that dissipates quickly and leaves good lacing. the aroma is heavy on tart fruit like honeycrisp apple and lemon while there is some grape and mild spicy hops and phenolics as well as a crackery bread note. the taste follows suit with tart apple lemon grape skin and some tannic woodiness. sourdough bread herbal hops and some slightly spicy yeast round things out. the body is light and crisp without being watery very refreshing. overall this is a stellar light farmhouse ale that i enjoyed immensely and definitely see myself coming back to. this on a hot summer day with a good sandwich would be hard to top.
5976,Massacre,4.21,pours an almost black brown. small foamy head that recedes to a thin ring after about a minute or so.  a little bourbon on the nose followed by stewed stone fruits raisins a little toffee peaks in as well.  the bourbon sits in behind the woody barrel character which is sting on the tongue. some of the the stewed fruit and a little chocolate follow. lightly drying.  the body is moderate. there is a lightness to this despite the high abv and barrel. very good.  this is a very enjoyable beer
5977,Massacre,4.14,hot as fuck.
5978,Massacre,4.49,another michigan brewery nails it. doppelbock very heavy boozy. im lucky to be in mi where i can score this often. outstanding.
5979,Massacre,4.29,the pour is much darker than i expected not black but darn close. a beige head says hello and then quickly takes its leave. the aroma- bourbon on forefront no bones about that. boozy figs prunes raisins and caramel. a potent aroma that is making me wonder what ive got myself into.  the taste is not what i expected either. theres an initial sweetness that seems to accompany many ba beers but that is quickly replaced by a bitterness whether that is from hops or roasted malts i cannot say. not unpleasant and keeps this from being cloying. bourbon figs caramel char coffee dates all shout to be heard (tasted sorry) and it\s a fun flavor fight for a while. i will state that i am glad it was just a 12 oz serving. it almost wore me out trying to separate out what i was tasting. the feel is good no issues at all. viscous enough to remind you this is punching above its normal weight class. glad this is available locally i think ill try and cllar one or two and see how they hold up.
5980,Massacre,4.34,12 oz bottle 2017 poured into into a tulip  a- dark brown with a small tan head.  s- bourbon dark fruits sweet cherries some figs toffee some leather oak.  t- bourbon dark fruits leather toffee figs cherries oak slightly earthy some chocolate towards the finish that lingers nicely.  m- smooth medium to full body.  o- haven’t tried this fresh so i can’t if it gets better with aged but it seems to age well.
5981,Massacre,4.15,2021-11-19 12oz capped/waxed bottle served in a stemmed tulip. 2021 bottle. dont see a specific date on it. received from @whyteboar in a lif associated with nbs bif #14.  pours dark brown to pitch black with a surprisingly large head that collapses to a few millimeter thick layer. smell is chocolatey vanilla maybe a little maple. some roasted coffee.  taste is moderate syrup sweetness moderate anise lots of chocolate sweetness tons of vanilla. bitterness in the finish...maybe roasted grain maybe a little woodiness.  mouthfeel is medium to thick smooth rich just slightly lively satisfying. overall very good!
5982,Massacre,4.25,good head production and ok retention. body is a very dark brown nearly but not quite black and does not appear to be perfectly clear. lacing is short-lived on the glass.  huge bourbon on the nose. booze mash oak prune raisin toffee caramel. a wonderful aroma that is simultaneously inviting and a touch intimidating.  very challenging on the palate. theres an initial sweetness matching the nose but that is quickly replaced by a surprising bitterness a combination of the oak roasted barley and hops. bourbon slightly soured grapes caramel toffee light char coffee dates. everything hits so quickly and all together that its difficult to pick it apart and similarly not quite as easy to approach as other beers.  very smooth on the palate with little harshness despite the sky-high abv.  this is an excellent beer that promises to age well. fresh its more bitter than i think it deserves; i would challenge anyone with access to this beer to try it at various ages: fresh 1- and 2- years.
5983,Massacre,4.35,appearance - the beer was black in color with a mocha colored head crowning the glass.  smell - the dark vaults of the logger made for caramel like notes with the bourbon.  taste - smooth bourbon combine with chocolate nuts. it’s still had a little bite. there were chocolate notes as well. a little bitterness lingered toward the back.  mouthfeel - the field was amazingly smooth with small carbonation.  overall - for the style this was superb. it was smooth and chocolatey.
5984,Massacre,4.43,courtesy of @blutz as a trade extra: 2017 wolverine state massacre bba imperial dark lager. never heard of the brewery or the brew so totally new to me. 12 oz bottle nicely wax-sealed. poured cellar temp assertively to an ipa-ish wide-mouth glass. half-inch head comes out as an oddity much like the dark soul i had some time ago in that it has a creamy mocha tan color that looks like it belongs on an oatmeal stout instead of a lager. color is dark translucent burnt mahogany. nose has a very prominent bourbon aroma sweet caramel and some winter spiciness.  first sips are surprising and marvelous! the bourbon is strong the main profile is oozy dark caramel with an ending hit of a cinnamon-esque flavor. it reminds me of a nice barleywine in some respects. mouthfeel is full decadent with carbonation on the finish that clears the way for a long-lasting linger of all the flavors. boozy aroma and flavor that matches the abv but no burn and no warming...much too easy to drink like it’s an 8%er but this is clocking in over 14%. as it warms more stone fruit flavors like plum/prune come to the mid and rear of the swallow.  it’s totally delicious! three years has done it justice.
5985,Massacre,4.17,12oz bottle at share.muddy brown pour with a small beige head. seemingly like a stout roast malts and chocolate filter up first followed by some brown sugar and bourbon. taste is more roast boozy and a bit more stout-ish than a dopplebock but still great.
5986,Massacre,4.21,poured into a pint glass. a nice dark chestnut color fairly clear and with a modest tan head. vanilla and bourbon dominated the first sniff and a closer inspection brought roasted grain notes like caramel and cherry. the taste followed. the barrel was there but supported the caramel and cherry notes. full bodied but this did not feel like a 14+% abv beer. slightly boozy and hot on the finish but this was well done. i was impressed with the rich malty notes as this stayed true to a doppelbock despite the heft. well done and recommended for a big beer.
5987,Massacre,4.16,very nice rich hearty bock from a solid local brewery. no date printed on bottle. pours a thicker honeyed rust brown color with just a little off-white head and very minimal scant lingering lacing. smells of brown sugar raisin fig malt caramel vanilla and faint hops. tastes similarly strong sipper for sure but still the very high abv was a little deceivingly hidden. good depth and complexity. smooth slightly sticky mouthfeel with decent carbonation. a solid beer for its style.
5988,Massacre,4.52,jan 2021 review 2020 vintage poured into a chalice  similar to previous reviews except this is fresher. a bit more alcohol bite less head and lacing than last years review. but still really tasty any worth trying. overall going to knock look taste feel down a notch each.  review dec 15 2019 2017 vintage poured into a tulip glass.  overall: essentially the same as the jul 2018 review. this is really good. reminds me more of a barleywine than a lager but great no matter the name. this was my last 2017 but i think i’ve got some 2018 and need to find some 2019. absolutely worth trying/buying if you see it.   updated review jul 26 2018. pour: 2017 vintage so about 9 months old. 12oz bottle. poured into a pint glass. beautiful mahagony color with light coming through on the edges. 1-2 finger tan head that dissaptes into clouds and a nice ring with small amounts of lacing. really attractive.  nose: lots going on here. caramel molasses dark chocolate raisins and brandied dark fruits dominate. as label notes sweet bourbon and malt also present.  taste: definitely follows the nose but maybe even more molasses and bourbon on the front end. definite chocolate dark fruit as well. some hoppy bitterness on the backend keeps the sweetness well balanced. 14.5% abv is well hidden. alcohol is there but really well balanced. not sure why i didn’t like this as much the first time but suspect aging has helped mellow the alcohol bite into a soft embrace (lol). i really like this.  mouthfeel: fair amount of carbonation but still a thick viscous syrupy feel. that’s right up my alley. bitterness on the backend lingers a bit but quickly clears. maybe the lagering gives it a clean finish? really have no idea why i ranked this relatively low the first time. maybe the carbonation has mellowed?  overall: i really like this. a bba lager is unusual but this is absolutely worth trying. again aging seems to have improved it in my opinion but maybe i just didn’t appreciate it the first time. or just in a great beer mood tonight!?! after thinking i would not buy again i will seek out he 2018 vintage when available. one 2017 left that i will save for a meaningful wolverine victory hopefully this fall.  original review ratings from around oct or nov 2017. look 4 smell 4.25 taste 3.5 feel 3 overall 3.75. i recall not really liking it a lot. too in your face.
5989,Taiwan Beer,2.14,i love pale lagers even adjunct ones so i\m not rating low just because of the style. instead it\s because this is flat soapy maybe a little lemony and oddly filling considering just how little it appeals to the palate. not a great export at all. this is from a six pack of 10.4 oz (330ml?) green bottles with no date - maybe stored badly? additionally - mine says 5% abv not the 4.5% that others report. but it\s definitely taiwan beer.
5990,Taiwan Beer,3.63,poured from an undated 12oz can into a pils glass  on the pour a 2 finger head that pokes out of the top of the glass forms then slowly recedes to a rocky slightly fizzy head then to just a covering over thentop after 10 or so minutes. body is a light golden straw with a very light chill haze.  aroma is incredibly light and very clean. based off the aroma alone and the inclusion of rice as the only adjunct i disagree with the current aal classification and believe this is much closer to a japanese rice lager. light hops are present and a very light but clean lager yeast note. malts are quite light and what is there is rice crackery.  taste is very similar to the smell again very light but insanely clean and detectably hoppy. everything about this is light but the hops are floral and fruity woth almost zero bitterness and the yeast notes are light dry and again vaguely fruity. the finish is where the malt comes in and it is very light and crackery with rice lightness present but the rice itself doesnt contribute much to the flavor. once the beer warms a bit there is a bit of a dirty lager finish but it takes a while for it to set in and doesnt cover the good parts of this beer.  feel is light and very dry with a decent carbonation bite. very refreshing and drinkable but the mouthfeel is incredibly dry. not the softest beer in the mouth a bit of a fizzy feeling. finish is medium long but clean.  overall this is an impressive asian beer. more than just another boring pale lager it has some defining features and a nice floral hoppy note. very dry and surprisingly good. i only got it because i kept seeing it at total beverage and the can looked nice but this is actually impressive and memorable.
5991,Taiwan Beer,2.69,never seen this before in the states until today dubbed classic now its a fine asian brew fuller bodied and slightly sweeter than most but also mysteriously and thankfully missing the yucky parts of most of these no metal no corn no adjunct cheapness and while its not all that good its also not all that bad and thats at least as valid in this style range especially from this part of the world where our american standards really do not apply in the same way and i am thankful to be trying this especially with a heady vegan curry burrito you never know what you are going to find out there. simple stuff here international lager type but slightly big malt liquor-esque to me a little adjuncty but not as offensive as so many and in this category i think its decent. it cuts spice its not objectively cheap and there is great carbonation here. that said i wouldnt choose this even over a basic available lager type here molson canadian labatt blue heck even high life wins here but its shooting its shot and i dont hate it smells and tastes like the can but whatever its fun especially in this food context. always been an international yellow beer nerd and here is another one life is good!
5992,Taiwan Beer,2.42,.5l bottle from fu bonn market. medium golden clear initial foamy head. heads fades to small cap. grainy aroma adjunct grains cooked vegetables. taste is sweet and grainy light vegetal notes. creamy feel. drinkable.
5993,Taiwan Beer,3.01,import adjunct lager. the first one went down pleasantly but i tried pouring the second into a glass; better experience chugging cold out of the can. pale pale yellow in color with decent head and lacing for the style. cereal grain is the first scent i pick up with hints of old world hops plus something musty in the back. very thin feel to the 4.5%. finishes cold and fizzy albeit on the watery side. grainy notes persist. better in the can for certain as the less desirable mustiness is less noticeable.
5994,Taiwan Beer,3.13,look - golden color transparent small head that dissipates leaving virtually no lacing. smell - syrupy sweetness with some malts and rice fragrance. no skunkiness and actually quite pleasant overall. taste - unfortunately the taste did not make up for the smell. fairly watery no hops presence and light malty flavor. finishes with slight sweetness a strong indicator of the proportion of rice used in this brew. feel - light bodied high carbonation on par with most adjuncts at 4.5% abv. overall - an adjunct that is quite pleasant on the smell but standard on the taste. nothing atrocious but nothing amazing either.
5995,Taiwan Beer,3,purchased in a nc grocery and poured from a 12oz can. a- nice light-golden pour with a 1 finger head that vanishes. continually working carbonation. s- an appealing nose: clean sweet malts straw and a little citrus. t- nothing special but certainly not a bad beer. sweet malts (ponlai rice i assume responsible for the sweetness) but pretty clean (not corn syrup and not vegetal like nasty stateside macros). some straw and something passing for a very light lemon/citrus finish on the tongue. straight at you beer. crisp and refreshing. m- well-carbonated just short of zippy. not pasty. not syrupy. again the word clean. o- again offering nothing special. but definitely a decent lager for this palate. not exactly comfortable looking at down the pipe 3s but its an honest and fair evaluation from these beer senses.
5996,Taiwan Beer,2.97,not that bad that you would suppose after sering the ratings. it has a slight sweetness to it that is not annoying so the beer remains drinkable. though a weak lager it was okay with taiwanese food.
5997,Taiwan Beer,1.08,i poured this straight in like the brewer suggested but it’s very hard to drink. smells like airplane glue. taste even worse. like drinking a bowl of rice. this may be the most popular beer in taiwan but what other beer choices do they have? the low scores are very appropriate for this beer. nothing i would want to drink again.
5998,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.39,not bad in fact pretty good! the abundant smell and taste of cherrys would make george washington blush!!!
5999,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.42,sam adams cherry wheat is a decent seasonal beer. granted you can find it on the shelves outside the fall & winter months but it really belong there. it’s not nearly as refreshing drinking it on a hot summer day as opposed to a chilly fall or winter day/night.  it has a bite when first taking a mouthful but finishes nicely. the cherries are noticeable at first but after having more than one beer in a given setting you don’t really notice the cherry taste anymore. hence it’s not very vibrant it’s just there. it also sits on the heavier side too so a 6 pack is generally enough for any one given person at a time.
6000,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.42,i just want to say i have tried many cherry beers especially michigan cherry beers and pnw cherry beers... this is hands down the best cherry beer i can drink all day or if i had to pick one cherry beer.. this is the one i would drink many times. for sure. most other cherry beer is tart and not sweet...this one is like if a normal light american lager had a hybrid with a bit of cherry coke just for some smooth lager cherry flavor. i have bought many times very rarely is it a bad batch. would recommend.
6001,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.62,12oz bottle tulip best by may 2023. an office christmas gift as part of a mixed six.  the color is rather golden with perhaps a nod of pink though that could simply be the suggestion. the head was average and not long lasting.  i smell beer and cherry smoothie. i find the cherry aroma pleasant and real though it’s more like real cherry ice cream or a smoothie than fresh cherries. sweet creamy fruity small tang.  the taste very much follows; cherry yogurt pale wheat ale base. there is some bitterness to the finish which is mostly clean with a lingering sweetness like from one of them flavored sparkling waters that’re all the rage.  moderate body and carbonation. you can tell there’s wheat in it by a slight matte feel to it.  i’m a bit surprised given the reputation this beer at least used to have on this site. i’d say a good word to describe it is “pleasant” as long as you’re in the mood for something light and fruity. c’mon it’s clearly for non-beer drinkers or beginners.
6002,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.7,a great beer with michigan cherries
6003,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.21,look: poured into pint glass 1 finger head. yellow  smell: cherries hit you immediately smells like a cherry soda  taste: cherries and a traditional sam adams. very good!  feel: dissipates quickly not heavy at all.
6004,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.98,refreshingly flavored. love the color. been a favorite for 20 years. the carbonation stands out and actually quenches the thirst perfectly!
6005,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.8,pours a golden straw color with over a finger of head. the nose is straight-up maraschino cherries. the flavor has sweet cherry notes as well. the body is spot on.  to his makes for an enjoyable spring/summer session brew.
6006,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.9,#170 yum!
6007,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,5,first of all the smell. i could sit all day with the glass to my nose and just smell this all day. thick mouthfeel. very very tasty. just a great dessert stout!
6008,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.56,2022 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. nice thickness. dominant peanut aroma. solid blend of chocolate peanut and marshmallow flavor.
6009,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.38,not much peanut butter perhaps due to barrel
6010,Wide Awake It's Morning,4.32,2017 vintage  moving right along from the incredible maple bacon coffee porter i had last night we now have the imperial version with an extra 3.1% abv. maybe the flavors will integrate even better in this beefier beer. let’s crack it open and find out  pours completely pitch black with a finger of light tan head that fades to ring and leaves minimal lacing  yeah it really is similar to the base beer in the nose just bolder. i’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple medium roast coffee dark chocolate toffee smoky bacon and burnt caramel  it definitely tastes fuller and in turn less abrasive than its base. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting sweet maple light roast coffee cocoa powder black cherry salty bacon and light caramel. the swallow brings notes of maple syrup smoky bacon burnt caramel medium roast coffee tobacco brown sugar and light vanilla  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick beer. finishes mostly dry with a balanced sweetness  this one is also really good just edging out the base beer. next up is the barrel aged version morning wood which i’m very excited to try
6011,Older Viscosity,4.36,served in a snifter glass from the bottle.  appearance: dark black color with medium bubbles to the body. tan head off the body which rose maybe one fingers length. dropped to almost nada after two or three sips. no lacing at all due to the slightly thin body.  smell: heavy brown sugar smells warm...as if it was melted in a saucepan with the coffee brewing next to it.  taste: complex and sweet...molasses overdose which hits your with a touch of espresso and whiskey to go with.  mouth: sticky brew medium carbonation. sweet finish which lingers in the mouth cheeks for a very very long time.  overall: whiskey heavy which you get no complaints from me. soft carbonation with the most everlasting stickiness to the brew. salud!
6012,Older Viscosity,4.13,12.7 fl.oz. corked bottle courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 12.0%. pitch black colour moderate tan head. intense aroma of sweet malts bourbon whiskey vanilla and oak also moderate roasty notes hints of chocolate and liquorice. very sweet (too sweet?) and intense flavour sweet malts galore notes of bourbon oak and vanilla again also notes of mild coffee dark chocolate and liquorice. moderate hops.
6013,Older Viscosity,4.69,2010 bottle drank 2020. definitely waited too long and this bottle definitely wasnt kept in optimal conditions over the years but based on my ratings i really enjoyed this...!!  smelled wonderfully bourbonny and stouty. wasnt flat but had lost an element of carbonation. taste was nicely bourbon stout not char or roast but a enough in that direction to let you know it was a traditional stout. cant believe this bad boy has fallen so far in ratings over the years in the face of pastry stouts. im going to see if i can find a more recent bottle just to have one on hand as this is too good to not revisit now and then. cheers!
6014,Older Viscosity,4.54,stamped vintage 2014-a. pours black minimal head not as viscous as youd think. bourbon smell chocolate. mouthfeel isnt very thick but crazy smooth. taste is amazing. lots of soft bourbon plenty of chocolate old leather hint of moccha. crazy soft.
6015,Older Viscosity,4.31,l: pitch with a toffee ring of a head.  s: roasts of all kinds: roasted raw sugars vanilla beans coffee and a touch of pure char. this is mostly roast and bourbony-vanilla notes.  t: like an oaky oatmeal stout that has seen its day in a barrel. vanilla for days - coffee roastiness and some minimal chocolate.  f: smooth and coating medium-heavy feel. not a stand-out in its viscosity in my view.  o: clearly this beer holds up for a long time based on the 8 year vintage below. mine was a 2014 vintage tried in 2019 and a five years i imagined it had lost something. my friend an older viscosity expert agreed it had. we presume on that collective experience that three years is likely ideal aging. but this was solid nonetheless.
6016,Older Viscosity,3.75,bottled 2014; drank 8/16/14 @ the yarchives.  brown/black hue.  dark khaki head; nice lace.  cream caramel & booze heat in the nose.  medium thick creamy mouthfeel.  milk oak aluminum & dark caramel up front; booze heat on the finish.  decent; too young?!
6017,Older Viscosity,4.19,about as nice as a stout can be. no aftertaste but really nice mild chocolate vanilla nutmeg and very smooth and silky. a warm beer when you need one.
6018,Older Viscosity,4.21,in review is a 2011 vintage.  a - pitch black pour with micro-thin toffee colored lacing and no carbonation at all. appearance is flat but lots of legs on the sides of the glass.  s - dark chocolate some delicate black licorice oak slightly boozy on the nose some dark sugar and molasses.  t - light coffee dark chocolate oak tannin bourbon delicate traces of dark fruit and molasses on the very back end.  m - silky viscous and sticky on the lips with some slight warming in the back of the throat.  o - this held up incredibly well for being a 2011 vintage. impressed.
6019,Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.35,amber color with a 2f head in an orval chalice.  at first lightly spicy aroma followed by a good fruitiness.  tangy spicy mf not overdone.  fruity taste accompanied by a lightly spicy finish.  excellent beer. a chalice is recommended. start at about 49° and let the beer warm up for more flavor.
6020,Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.4,pours an effervescent head that was gone when i turned back around. has a sweet malty nose. has a red amber color. the flavor is malty sweet with an effervescent mouthfeel. light finish with a light bready aftertaste.
6021,Trappistes Rochefort 6,3.79,4/29/23 single bottle bought from krogers in morgantown wv.  aroma light spice. sweet malt. pumpernickel bread. life a sweet dark brown sugar syrup  highly effervescent. bready. lingering malt and molasses. drying ending. leaves a not terribly nice aftertaste... cant describe it.
6022,Festina Pêche,3.9,why doesn’t dfh sell this in bottles/cans? one of their better offerings.
6023,Festina Pêche,3.83,it is pretty cool to see tiny peach chunks floating around. the smell is not as good as it could be. its a subtle peach smell slightly overpowered by the sour. the taste of this beer is excellent though. if you love peach with a sour afternoon this is the beer for you. this beer is so refreshing on a hot day and so crushable. the low abv and flavor make this an excellent light choice for the summer.
6024,Festina Pêche,3.54,this beer pours a cloudy apricot color with a moderate white head. there is a strong pleasant smell of pineapple. the taste is bitter and tangy. the most notable flavor is lemon but its overpowered by an artificial sweetener.
6025,Festina Pêche,3.81,poured from a 12 oz bottle into a dogfish head tulip  l: clear light golden pour with 2 fingers of fizzy white head. falls fast... minimal lacing.  s: tart and fruity. peach and light citrus.  t.f: peach/apricot up front. fruit... lemon citrus and crackery grains. modest tartness... not really sour. light bodied and well carbonated. lingering peach preserves at the finish.  o: a nice tart peach forward weisse. easy drinking... and with the low abv super drinkable.
6026,Festina Pêche,3.65,12 ounce can poured into a willi becher.  nice peach aroma. peach flavor is good to but more subtle. light and refreshing not too tart a touch watery.
6027,Festina Pêche,3.87,pours orange with a 1 inch white head. moderate lacing. hazy.  aroma is dank. peaches tangerine. not much else.  taste is sour. wheat tart peach tart apple. mouth puckering.  light bodied light carbonation. dry tart finish.  a nice tart beer. thirst quenching.
6028,Festina Pêche,3.66,12oz can from the variety pack about 2 months old  unfiltered no foam at first but a big head that sticks around after an aggressive pour; looks like apple cider otherwise. not too sweet not too sour... tart. light. not much to speak of grain and sour peaches. smells like a corona with too much lime.  the neo-berliner weiss tag is bizarre - i\ll call it sour light
6029,Busch Light,4.31,if you’re going to rate it rate it for what it is a light lager. it is by far my favorite of such.
6030,Busch Light,2.32,ol busch light. great for bbqs beach parties beer pong etc. basically the perfect budget light lager. best kept very cold and in the can because its not much to look at.
6031,Busch Light,1.66,12 ounce can into a thick plastic cup. pours straw yellow. quickly fading foam. wet grain smell but not much else.taste is same as mouthfeel. light watery refreshing perfect for summer bbq/cookouts or after mowing the lawn. best drunk ice cold out of the cooler i know a lot of beer drinkers look down on a-b miller. coors ect but lets be honest. not everyone can afford the snooty nose in the air craft types promoted on websites such as this. we drink what we can afford and is a good deal i was able to get a 15 pack for around 10 dollars. is bl the best? no but it isnt the worst either.
6032,Busch Light,4,i have a daughter in college. a son who just graduated hs and wants to go to a technical college. i dont have the money to spend on craft beer like i used to so a 30 pack of busch light will do. easy drinking decent taste. great for pounding when mowing the grass or bbqing. or on these 100 degree sotex days. since i dont have the money to be the beer snob i once was...busch is one of my cheaper go to beers.
6033,Busch Light,1.98,25fl oz can from albertsons. go big or go home! i should have gone home... im not sure you could get any paler for the body of this brew one finger head disappears before the pour is finished. aroma is very weak grains. taste introduces notes of apple (?) corn and grains. watery consistency. watery everything. not horrible just not much of anything except the water part. it does quench a thirst however ( just like water)
6034,Busch Light,2.84,it was almost as bad as bud light but not quite there. i don’t care for this one. someone gave it to me is the only reason i drank it. checked the date it was still current so i have found a beer that i don’t care for much. i won’t buy it. mild taste but hardly any flavor in that taste.
6035,Busch Light,1.74,poured from a 12 ounce can into a shaker pint glass the best by date is jun23.  appearance: pours a clear light golden color with one-finger white head that quickly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim appears to be lightly carbonated minimal lacing on the glass.  smell: light cornbread thats about all i got from it pretty one dimensional.  taste: the taste sadly followed the nose kind of watery and bland light taste of sweet cornbread and the hops are nearly imperceptible its not complex this is a one trick pony and its not a very imaginative trick.  palate: this is the worst score i have ever given in this category it was watery and lacked an appropriate level of carbonation most unpleasant.  overall: this is a terrible beer if i was invited fishing with a buddy and this is all he had for us to drink i would politely and reluctantly drink it but next time ill bring the beer. ab gets a lot of hate and its mostly deserved the flagship budweiser is a decent beer but busch light is pure garbage.
6036,Busch Light,2.65,25oz can best by july 2nd 2023  on the pour it was fizzy one second then completely headless the next. honestly looks like a cider or sparkling apple juice.  aroma is better than expected and largely clean other than a huge green apple acetaldehyde presence. super light in aroma with a light watered down grain finish but not pissy smelling like natty or keystone.  taste is again higher quality than its cousins and competitors but still incredibly watery and lacking in flavor. tastes like a decent lager that was watered down severely. finish is sweet barley and corn.  feel is the closest to beer flavored seltzer i think ive gotten other than michelob ultra but this is super chuggable fizzy and almost not there other than immense carbonation. despite that the finish is quite long. feels better when ice cold but has a crisp finish.  overall this is the definition of halfway decent and not quite in a good way. although better than most of the macro light lagers especially for the price point the things i like about it just dont hit with enough force almost forcing you to chug the beer for any sort of satisfaction.
6037,Busch Light,1.25,about as bland and bad as it can get when it comes to light beers. i kinda wanna try regular busch beer just to see if its any better.
6038,Busch Light,1,it’s not a beer for flavor.i don’t understand why people don’t drink more pabst. this is for people who chug beer to get drunk and not enjoy the flavor. i wish more people would try pabst instead of this
6039,Busch Light,2.93,picked up only to compare against regular busch. hard to tell the difference. looks the same in the glass tastes the same too. its not a bad beer but its quite confusing having this and the original side by side in stores.
6040,Abrasive Ale,4.35,16-oz can into nonic pint glass  a - cloudy body of golden amber under a finger of off white foam  s - floral citrus pine sweetness  t - big citrus (mainly pink grapefruit) bitter floral notes a little pine peppery spice quite fruity heavy malt backbone (but the bitterness never lets up); bitter complex and enjoyable!  m - bitterness bites all the way through smooth full body average carbonation  o - an excellent dipa from surly!
6041,Abrasive Ale,4.4,(16 oz can canned on 11/18/22 f5670; purchased 4-pack off shelf at shangys... poured into a fat tulip)  l: slightly-hazy medium amber-colored liquid; not a huge head on the pour but its tight with a frayed cotton contour... only holds a thin collar thin misty cap; does leave a big band of lace oppo of sip spot  s: very floral initial pop (rosewater) followed by some fleshy orange pulp lemon/grapefruit zest background hint of pine... a little honeyish malt wants to poke through... gummy orange slices... only a soft essence of alcohol... excellent overall intensity  t: citrus kiss but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base with a muffin/cakey quality but its sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge  f: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue mildly intensified by the ethanol which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation  o: why did this take so long to be released out east here(?) especially considering furious had been here for years now; this was the first surly beer i ever heard of c. 2011 (though darkness and bender werent far behind)... i am going to try the next can in a pint which theyre website suggests is the preferred vessel... aggressive and comforting (2081)
6042,Abrasive Ale,4.85,i am so happy to have finally found this locally (pa) after searching for it for years. it did not disappoint. while the can is over a couple of months old the ale still tasted very fresh. i rate it as having a ne flavor profile while having a west coast appearance. it is translucent and golden but definitely not cloudy. the head was white and not too foamy. the aromas came in waves of sweet fruit. the flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit. what a fantastic drinking experience. the only downside was the $5 price tag but that would be a bargain in a tavern.
6043,Abrasive Ale,4.24,canned 11/7/22 (1 month ago)  appearance: pours a slightly cloudy (80% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. srm of 9. (4.00)  aroma: strong aromas of rich grapefruit tropical mango and melon. resinous earthy and tropical. some tropical peach evolves as it warms. (4.25)  flavor: flavors follow the nose with strong tropical grapefruit pineaple mango/melon with a sweet peach undertone. a moderate balance of sweet and smooth caramel balanced by bitter pine notes. (4.25)  feel: heavier bodied strong carbonation and finishes sweet but surprisingly clean and drinkable on the palate. (4.25)  compared to revolution anti-hero ipa 12/2022: pours lighter stronger aromas. more juicy grapefruit tropical pineapple melon and peaches. less resinous nectarine and syrup. juicier but also more balanced with pine bitterness. winner: surly  compared to surly axe man 2/2023: pours darker hazier. stronger aromas. more sweet and juicy tangerine and peach. less dank berry and pine notes.  overall: wow a surprisingly fantastic ipa here. grapefruit tropical pineapple mango/melon and peach flavors. juicy with enough pine and grapefruit citrus rind to balance. beldns neipa juicy flavors with west-coast body and mouthfeel. sort of reminds me of half acres ipa blends and not unlike axe man in many ways. (rating: 4.24)
6044,Abrasive Ale,4.11,review 1713 abrasive ale surly brewing imperial ipa date: 17 dec 2021 another beer that i have wanted to be marked off my list. the beer is 46 degrees and i used a tulip glass. a frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. the slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. the color charts around srm 6 deep golden yellow. clarity is brilliant with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. the appearance of the beer is excellent. ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what i immediately pick up. smelling beer again i detect pine bready yeasty honey-like sweetness oranges floral esters and herbal. interesting i get pineapple mango grapefruit floral and herbal notes from the first sip. taking another i taste bread dough oranges pine lightly toasted malts pharmaceutical and a touch of dank. the mouthfeel is sticky sweet and coating. the body is medium the carbonation is low and the finish lingers. this is not what i was expecting for this beer. the malts are heavy and drown out the hops. the hop profiles are unique in is own way. i was expecting something like a wcipa and got a hybrid. i would not say this beer is abrasive. when i think of an abrasive beer i think of ruination the first one not this newer crap. the beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing.
6045,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.31,off the hard stuff running nothing like a guinness after a day made of work and running for health. so well balanced. like the extra stout from the bottle better than the draught these days though i like the pub draught atmosphere of course as much as the living room. i dream of this beer on my runs and keep it to two a day in training. a beauty.
6046,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.18,from a 22oz bottle imported from ireland (not brewed in baltimore) bottle # l3036gd002 / 00:08 into a guinness pint glass. very drinkable with just enough body to balance the bitterness with a low creaminess so as not to be coating on the palate. not my favorite style but when compared to the style requirements its almost as if they the style was written based on this beer. regardless i cant rate it a five just yet. 4.25  a – pours a clear but opaque black in the glass with red highlights with a three-finger frothy light tan head that slowly dissipates. 4.5  s – dry and roasty nothing burnt sweet nor coffee. some very minor dark chocolate. 4.0  t – roasty malt but dominated by a dry almost burnt hoppy bitterness. no sweetness or hop flavors. 4.25  mf – medium light body with a dry almost astringent finish. not creamy in my opinion (but not a nitro pour). 4.0
6047,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),2.53,much as it shames me being about 70% irish heritiage i simply cannot like this beer......... many do its just not for me........
6048,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.79,pours opaque black with a thick light tan head. good retention great lacing. aroma is roasted malt and dark chocolate. flavor follows the nose dark bread and roasted malt. feel is smooth medium bodied with low carbonation. overall a very nice irish stout.
6049,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.85,aye tis be a fine day fer da post o stout. ye shall recant a purvew o the generalities o blightys and irelands lovely brew.  enough proofy prothy wonky and cobblygoobly talk. here we go.  the look: onyx.  the smell: at times the scent of dark malted barley (literally) and coco nibs.  taste: when traveling the exhausting terrain of tralfamadore my senses were heightened. ever since then every beer tastes precisely the same except a traditional stout. a lovely biscuit dark chocolate and roasty veggies would pair well. the brew itself roasty and slightly bitter (not the style).  feel: completely devoid of human interaction i found the comfort in the only beverage available to humans. a toutshsawgoh. the first sip of this threw me into a stupor. my mouth felt a cozy forthy and welcoming presence to these parched lips.  overall: for every action there must always be an equal and opposite reaction... so said the doctor. gallifrey mustnt have any porters or stouts since this brew allows bipedal individuals to time travel just to taste it. this traditional stout is a classic and can still manage to transmit alienlike messages to our inner selves just to show us... it rocks.
6050,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.5,has that chocolaty kind of metal tasting guinness flavor of the original just a bit thicker.  style: stout | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 5.6% | rating: 3.5
6051,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.67,have had before but first time reviewing  allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 15 minutes and poured into a tulip pint glass (not a tulip glass).  pours black (ive read guinness is actually very dark red) with beautiful dark amber mixing with red hints around the edges with a 3 finger khaki head with foam that remains like seafoam when the head dissipates.  initial aroma is slightly metallic followed by light olive green hoppy and dark tan bitter smells. smells almost as if it doesnt have much body.  initial taste is bitter and a little sour followed by malty as well as slightly reminiscent of purple grape soda when this mixes with the bitterness its a little like grape medicine but not unpleasant at all. more bitter in the aftertaste mixing with cocoa that lingers on the back of the tongue and the back of the roof of the mouth. its dry throughout the entire tasting process as you would expect an irish dry stout to be. as i get more than halfway through i notice a note of molasses as well as a general sweetness throughout in addition to the bitterness.  mouthfeel is richer than average overall smooth it goes down very easily and i have zero complaints about it but unfortunately i struggle to find any ways to describe what the carbonation does in the mouth or how it sits on the tongue.  will buy again at some point but were it not attached to the guinness name i dont know if i would and i find myself leaning towards not. overall a solid beer.
6052,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.24,its been a while since ive had this and it is much better than i remember. nice depth of flavor and id say a superior beer to the draught (or at least the draught in a can).  im getting an aroma primarily of malt and chocolate sweetness which is what hits first on the taste as well. it then progresses with a wave of roast and a balancing bitterness (semi-dark chocolate and char) that nicely offsets the sweetness. on the finish and aftertaste there is a slight addition of dark fruit. medium bodied and moderate carbonation.
6053,Red's Rye IPA,4.18,on tap at founders  pours an amber red with a one finger foamy white head. smells of caramel and biscuity malt peppery rye pine and citrus peel. malty up front with caramel notre mid palate gives citrus zest and pine resin. the finish gives some malty sweetness with a citrus linger. medium body with moderate carbonation foamy mouthfeel and finish
6054,Red's Rye IPA,4.57,astounded that i have not reviewed this yet. it is the single beer that i have never fell out of favor with. others come and go as tastes change but this one always hits the sweet spot for me. pours a lovely burnished red and sports a manilla colored head for a little while. the aroma is hoppy and malty and just an ideal combination of these. the taste is where this really shines. crisp is the word- such a balanced layering of flavors from spices to caramel to citrus and a refreshing bitterness to finish the sip. the feel is ideal for the style i am not sure it can be improved. oa it’s always on draft around w michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly. or so they say. i’d rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all. really good beer!
6055,Red's Rye IPA,4.04,pretty good rye ipa. dark amber color with ample white head. rye flavored ipa with nice flavor profile and few off-putting flavors. overall eminently drinkable—not too bitter for an ipa not too sweet. well rounded and well crafted.
6056,Red's Rye IPA,5,best beer ive ever had!
6057,Red's Rye IPA,3.75,355 ml bottle courtesy of cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 6.6% 70 ibus. reddish brown colour big and lasting off-white head. nice aroma of floral and citrussy hops (dry hopped with amarillo) also sweetish notes of caramel and orange marmalade. the flavour has also notes of orange marmalade and caramel malts but is not extremely sweet. there is a distinct hoppy bitterness towards the end with grapefruity and resinous notes lasting through the long aftertaste. good stuff.
6058,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.06,i had this on draft 9/5/23 @ the hopleaf.  cloudy dull orange appearance.  big khaki head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lacing remained.  artisanal soap fresh flowers mild banana & faint clove notes in the rather bold nose.  creamy medium mouthfeel.  banana cream lemon & mild fresh flower flavors up front; dry clove notes on the finish.  smelled a bit more interesting than it tasted but overall this is a fine tripel.
6059,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.25,8/2/23 happy 802 day!!  gouden carolus tripel  brouwerij het anker  carolus belgian tripel  a classic authentic belgian golden style all amped up!! love this stylewhich clearly goes way over the heads of most folks here on untapped. its a brilliant style. spicy and sour yeast is huge. peppery sour funk and earthy goodness all over the place. a heavy version but full of love and funk. creamy foam head lacing on a lively golden look. vegetal and spices with deep golden malty slickness.
6060,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.29,750 ml capped bottle dated 7/13/21 so about 2 years old  pours a cloudy bright yellow golden color thick creamy bone-white head. great head retention. pleasant aroma of pale malt and spicy clove. similar taste starts a touch sweet but finishes drier. no hint of the 9% abv. super smooth mouthfeel
6061,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.34,poured into a gulden draak tulip. pours a hazy medium golden amber with a three finger white head that slowly dissipates to a thick cap with solid lacing. aroma of lightly grainy malt belgian yeast coriander mystery stone fruit; somewhat muddled. flavor is grainy malt light generic citrus light stone fruit and dried tropical fruit particularly mango. coriander and a touch of clove kick in at the finish with mild hint of hop bitterness. medium bodied with moderate creaminess. this is a unique take on the tripel style; the general profile is very much classic tripel malt yeast and spicing but the fruit flavors are hard to identify but very pleasant and intriguing. fun to repeatedly sip and try to parse flavors. abv well covered. the aroma was surprisingly muted and jumbled but the flavor is excellent. surprised to have never tried this tripel from het anker but really hope it is permanent in our market. im a big tripel fan and its rare to find a new one. this is a keeper; not unexpected from this great brewery.
6062,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.35,poured at fridge temp from a 750ml bottle. pours a semi-opaque yellow with an abundance of fluffy white head. the nose is fantastic. banana orange biscuits a touch of honey a slight nutty note damp grass.  the taste is wonderful. sweet caramel wheat grass oranges vanilla sugar cookies a very slight hint of citrus peel bitterness a slightly earthy funky note and a touch of oak. just a great beer with vibrant flavors! mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite dry. lovely beer.
6063,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.47,on tap at the bierhuis in prague. super sweet but balanced with a proper malt bill. about as good as the style gets. massive flavor and insane drinkability. stellar.
6064,Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.26,(330 ml bottle production date: 06/09/2021; purchased cold single from pinocchios in media today... poured into a st. bernardus goblet)  l: pale brassy-amber liquid; fluffy pillow of foam atop which gracefully breaks up into a messy collar and cratery cap... laces a little but that messy collar retains  s: buttery biscuit with grainy perimeter tones; perhaps some mealy oxidation creeping in... touch of underripe banana skin; maybe a hint of coriander but not much... subtle accents of phenolic booze and nutty earthy yeast... overall relatively bold intensity; approaches threshold of depth... gradually reveals a floral herbal overtone  t: oh yes spiced for sure much coriander perhaps some orange peel especially in the finish: citrus oils semblance of pith... a few sips in and its malt background begins to fill in lightly pancakey with a ghostly metallic highlight... its citrusy fruitiness slowly builds in the aftertaste on the palate floor really helping to fill in its vertical spectrum of jagged flavorings  f: very delayed emergence of warmth in the thorax... light-bodied but with a luscious oily undercurrent... delicately foamy approach but the spice and booze cleave it hard in the finish  o: quite pleased with this tripel; first time in a long while finding single small bottles of it... did not expect the big spicy-herbal punch... kinda cant lay off of it mmm (2053)
6065,Gouden Carolus Tripel,3.09,not my cup of tea. nice color and a nice foam. you can smell the hops and fruitiness. but you can also smell and tast grain gins. for me is this beer to strong to taste the real flavors. thats too bad.
6066,Brahma Chopp,3.85,kind of reminds me of old school american beer like old milwaukee but with buttery mouth feel
6067,Brahma Chopp,3.28,poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. straw colored thin white head mild lacing abundant carbonation. aroma of musty grains. mouthfeel is light thin and frothy. flavor of grain husks cracker some grassy hops in the background. overall: decent but thats about it.
6068,Brahma Chopp,1.77,this might be the best beer you can find in some parts of amazonian brazil. a bottle makes it special. remind yourself that the beer is just to stay hydrated and wash down the worlds best fish.
6069,Brahma Chopp,3.06,the first beer i had from brazil and it was better than i expected! of course it is just a lager but it has a surprisingly sweet fruitiness to it that\s still enjoyable and not overly sweet. some might not like this feature about it but for me it is the very key to its uniqueness. consumable fruity refreshing. all good!
6070,Brahma Chopp,1.66,l: very light gold beer very low retention. s: grassy sweet malt. t: sweet water grass clearly an immature beer. f: very watery carbonation is on the low side. o: there are better wouldnt go for a second try in this one.
6071,Brahma Chopp,2.97,355 ml bottle 4.80% abv exp. 12/2017. ingredients: water malt adjunct hops. very clear and yellow liquid with little foam. sweetness white bread and fresh grass on aroma all very faint. the same with its flavor. watery and smooth with a dry finish. a bit too much of carbonation. i havent taken one of those for ages and now i guess it has improved or maybe got back to what it was as no bad notes showed up for me in this bottle version.
6072,Brahma Chopp,2.76,can. from festival de las naciones. in teku glass. playing the silent age. no foam at all. peculiar taste with plenty of white grapes and a champagnesque aroma and taste specially at beginning. then it waters down
6073,Brahma Chopp,1.93,nothing i would reach for if i had a choice.
6074,Brahma Chopp,1.87,i tried this against antarctica original and thought this was less clean it has a slightly funky taste and aftertaste. still very similar and a typical light bodied adjunct lager. clear light yellow pour with very little head taste has milled corn and fermented grains and adjuncts slightly metallic aftertaste. feel is extremely light and a little fizzy. i prefer the antarctica original in terms of brazilian aals.
6075,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.43,(12 oz bottle 2022 vintage 13.5% abv; purchased single at the brewery last week... poured into a copita-like stemmed glass)  half-bright auburn-colored liquid with a tight gummy foam... dark caramel old dry furniture wood kiss of chocolate chip on the nose; not overtly boozy; pleasant expression... dark caramel with great depth on the palate; bold base of parts bready and cakey malt; altogether somehow barely influenced/disturbed by boozy spice or fruitiness but if (probably) present sit beautifully in the background; all it now begs for is some barrel funk and/or oxidation to give it hair give it a weathered unique personality... well i guess we must chalk it up to the aging thats responsible for the raunch of rotgut having been rolled off to the point of regally rendering this malt nectar not sludgy but satin-soft  what curmudgeon aspires to be (but theyre different enough for each to have a place); possibly the best (american) old ale ive tried but one that sits a step or two away from being legendary; all its lacking is the old but i loved this and luckily have a bottle of the ba version waiting in the wings (2192)
6076,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.19,pours a near-black until the last couple ounces when it turns into a muddy brown with a burgundy-tint. head is a finger of beige foam. aroma is raisins dark fruits caramel and toasty caramely bready malts. faint bourbon and barrel come thru as well but dont do enough to raise the temp of the aroma. its potent but balanced. flavor profile packs a little bit more than the aroma bringing raisins dark fruits caramel toffee and chocolate with roasty caramely and bready malts underneath. faint whiskey underneath which brings a little heat wave but nothing that disrupts the balance. mouth feel is medium-thick with a silty texture. effervescence is soft. alcohol flattens out the final third. overall an easy going 13.5% old ale that manages to display whiskey along the way without being unwieldy. that said its still fill and fun.  served in a 15.5oz spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle. 2018 version. consumed/reviewed 10/11/2022.
6077,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.14,2013 vintage; consumed on 2/9/2022  pours a clear deep ruddy chestnut brown body capped with a slight finger of fluffy off-beige foam; solid head retention leaves a thin layer of intermittent cap a thin creamy collar and virtually no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.  aroma is entirely dominated by and centered around twangy raisin coursing throughout; an underlying dusting of bakers chocolate details figgy esters and faded caramels over time while an increasingly luscious and jammy raisin holds focus.  taste opens to raisin juice accented with toasted fig burnt black bread and molasses with distant chocolate and wisps of nutty undertones progressing to the mid-palate as dark fruit jam peaks; brown sugar born from a residual sweetness phases into intermittent booziness amplifying subtler dark fruit esters as they linger through the finish.  mouthfeel features a rounded medium body with a composed moderate-high carbonation lively yet rounded while dispersing to slick semi-syrupy even textures over the mid-palate and eventually drying as a distant char balances a moderate warmth through the finish.  approaching a decade in the bottle this old ale has refined and embraced an undeniably one-note character sparking depth through sheer focus on a singular profile development to showcase a concentrated display of age across a quality base; an increasingly decadent sipper by way of a stalwart longevity.
6078,Mocha Wednesday,4.37,2021 vintage. pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it; pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly. bits of carb hitting the surface. no lacing/retention. nose is roasted coffee beans molasses black licorice loose change baking chocolate. very little barrel character at least initially. kind of mind-blowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesnt lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas; while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there they feel like parts of a whole that developed together rather than some gunk thats thrown in and overpowers the product. taste follows a similar vein - big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate. through its very long finish dark chocolate and dark fruit vanilla smoky wood salty black licorice and finally traces of warming spicy bourbon emerge. as on the smell a really impressive use of the adjuncts here - not at all overpowering but still present throughout. mouthfeel is the only real knock for me. the feel is surprisingly thin and i think a little more body would be nice (and even expected?) given the abv. really worth seeking out.
6079,Mocha Wednesday,4.45,2016 vintage. poured from a brown wax topped bomber into a tree house tulip. 19.4% abv  l: lighter than expected pour. medium to dark mahogany color with ruby highlights. a thin fizzy off-white head falls fast. not much in the way of lacing.  s: rich and boozy. booze. bourbon and vanilla... some oak cocoa and coffee. mostly booze.  t.f: sweet and rich. boozy... as expected at 19.4%. deliciously complex. cocoa and coffee mixed with oak roast and fudge. the coffee and chocolate especially come through and are nicely complemented by the bourbon and vanilla. a little thinner than expected. medium bodied... boozy but not as much as the 19.4% would make you think. still very drinkable. low carbonation. coffee/cocoa finish.  o: an outstanding overdone abv stout. great barrel character... and you get a lot of bourbon chocolate and coffee on this brew. held up super well at 6+ years in the cellar. this is an all-night sipper of a beer.
6080,Mocha Wednesday,4.49,750 ml bottle 2021 vintage bottled 10/21/21 label says 19.1% abv. served in a snifter the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away kinda quickly but leaves a small bit of head. small amount of lacing. i like the aroma the brew smells like bourbon coffee vanilla cacao nibs and roasted malt. taste is similar to the aroma but theres also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too. good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma. mouthfeel/body is full its slick rich and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. i thought this was a pretty good brew definitely worth picking up if youre into big barrel aged coffee stouts!
6081,Mocha Wednesday,4.35,2021 edition. coffee comes across as burnt hides the abv well. tasty but not something id seek out again.
6082,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2.31,imagine the most artificial strawberry flavor you can now add the flavor of throwing up tequila. that is strawberita. at 25 ounces and 8% abv this is a four loko that doesnt make you immediately commit felonies. would you like a diverse flavor profile? would you like something complex or subtle? do you want to enjoy a beverage? this is not the drink for you. do you want to get significantly toasty with two cans for $7.00 at your local grocery store? do you want to drink bottom shelf wine while maintaining some semblance of manhood? do you enjoy vomit or sugar hangover headaches? this my friend is the drink for you. enjoy at your own risk but only if youre broke under 25 a woman or have a death wish. cheers.
6083,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,1,this is not beer and it doesnt belong here!  drain-pour!
6084,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,1.96,split a can served frozen into a margarita glass - review from notes  like all variations of this beer - i think it\s just too damn sweet. the thing is like 90% hfcs. this one also has a ton of citric acid to help the sugar rot away your teeth (and your dignity)  just not worth it
6085,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,5,my favorite out of the rita series.  look-bright red smell-can smell strong strawberry smell taste-strong strawberry taste.very little alcohol taste.it is sweet but good. feel-slightly crab overall-a very good drink
6086,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,1.79,pours a shock of red kool-aid no head formation. strong whiff of intensely fake strawberry liquor essentially liquid jello shots in a glass. taste follows that road precisely. feel is thick sugary and raw like a dessert before its cooked.
6087,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,4.7,straw-ber-rita has no foam nor lacing but it does have lots of bubbles and a semi-clear red color. the aroma is of strawberry drink and the flavor is of that too with some pale malt & tartness. mouthfeel is high medium and straw-ber-rita finishes drying in that high-fructose corn syrup fashion.  rjt
6088,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,4.75,similar if not the same to the bud light lime a ritas
6089,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2.88,(25 oz can code 19173; purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)  l: cloudy fruit-punch colored liquid; foam on pour quickly collapses to nothing persistent activity of bubbles rising (observance mostly copied from my recent review of the lime-a-rita)  s: strawberry big league chew - no other way to describe it... intense but little booze presence... ok well yes the margarita (lime) element does slowly emerge  t: whoa not strawberry really - fake artificial sweets-injected strawberry; gummy strawberry... now i gotta know whats in artificial strawberry - 25% fruit essence 75% sugar?... this doesnt have the pool liner highlight that the reg. lime has - is it more pool float?... the flavorings in this bury the malt beverage base more than their standard lime-a-rita  f: its not all-out syrupy but theres definitely a concentrate or two slick-sliding though its core... for 8% the booze is buried rather well... not laborious to swill; fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence but nonetheless a tad too weighty (also mostly entirely copied from my lime-a-rita review - finding out these things are one-note)  o: thought the taste of this would wash out that of the flagship lime-a-rita i just had moments ago and boy was i right... this is seriously carbonated (malty) strawberry mad dog 20 20... the flavorings of these are to-taste with everyone naturally but 2 brands in and its apparent each variation was designed to appeal to an adolescent palate (1468)
6090,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,3.37,this is a party drink you only break these out if youre trying to get drunk. very sugary makes your teeth feel gritty.
6091,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2,clear light pink liquid with small white head. aroma of strawberries sugar boost grain and sugar. taste is medium to high sweet and light bitter with notes of strawberries sugar and boost. medium bodied with medium carbonation. awful.
6092,Leche Borracho,4.9,#178 good stuff!
6093,Leche Borracho,4.64,appearance - the beer poured a deep black color with tan specks at the top that bring to mind spice.  smell - the spice and delicious tequila were apparent in the nose.  taste - at the front i was made to think of spicy cinnamon chocolate cookies. notes of raisins ancho chili and tequila follow. there was even a hint of lime. after a few sips heat built up in the throat in the aftertaste.  mouthfeel - the body was smooth and thick perhaps just above medium bodied. carbonation was noted.  overall - i love tequila aged stouts.
6094,Leche Borracho,4.23,matte black with brown speckling and head. this strikes me as a more chocolatey and spicy westbrook mexican cake plus bourbon and tequila backing obviously. nice “french toast effect” with cinnamon some light caramel within the chocolate in the taste exclusively. smooth feel in between pepper spice hits well done by the way and the spiced textures of the cinnamon. taste is more clear in the flavors where smell is amalgamation of it all. would take mexican cake over this but still very good
6095,Leche Borracho,4.39,2016 vintage 550ml bottle poured into a snifter  a- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to leave nothing behind  s- aroma is rich with chocolate cinnamon and chili pepper up front followed by undertones of creamy lactose vanilla toffee and brown sugar. the tequila barrel comes across as a mezcal-like aroma with some oaky bourbon juice in the background  t- rich malty chocolate up front quickly gives way to cinnamon and pepper skin. mid-palate brings out the barrel notes; tequila takes center stage with some oaky bourbon complimenting. the finish gives more cinnamon and chocolate with a linger of pepper and creamy lactose  m- medium body with moderate carbonation foamy mouthfeel turns slightly creamy into the finish. some pepper heat pokes through after the finish  o- the barrel combo works well with this one well done
6096,Camo Black Extra,1.42,hello everyone. its been a decade or two. its been a long time since i found a new malt liquor but the malt liquor expert is back. i saw something one the shelf called camo black xextrax. i was hanging out with a 23 year old alcoholic and vaper took me to a vape shop where apparently all the kids are doing pastel-colored vapes and taking delta-8 hemp-derived thc gummies and all the gaudy neon lights brought me back to the good old days of being a 23-year old degenerate. our selections were informed by the very helpful recovering meth addict behind the counter who even provided legal advice on what i could and couldnt bring back to florida with me when my vacation was over.  naturally with all the nostalgia of legal loophole drug addicts taking me to weird head shops i demanded we pick up a fowdie.  at the corner store i was disappointed that oe now comes in 42 ounce containers. the fouwdie of my youth was gone. but there right next to it was the perfect thing i could have come across that night a completely unfamiliar malt liquor. furthermore the sketchiest looking design i could possibly imagine. this would be a good night.  smell is pure acetaldehyde. may as well call this green apple flavored. first swig reveals again nothing but a tart green apple flavor with nothing else to accompany it. however after a few swigs a hint of acetone can be detected.  all in all fun night of debauchery. would recommend. pairs well with a forty and half a philly cheesesteak.
6097,Camo Black Extra,1.28,welp i came back for more and this one is the big boy...  poured from a 24oz can.  on the pour it isnt promising a fizzy barely 1 finger white head came and went like i poured a soda. body is pushing a light amber color.  aroma is not identifiable as beer. smells like somebody added tequila to wine and let it sit out in the sun.  taste is exactly the aroma but sweeter and with an offputting bitterness. thankfully flavor doesnt linger.  feel is a redeeming value. somehow this feels better than the camo 900 with a lower abv in that there is much less of a syrupy feeling and everything fades incredibly fast making it at least consumable. incredibly carbonated and is almost vapourous.  overall i shouldve known after giving camo 900 a shot. the only redeeming value is the price/abv ratio is quite good.
6098,Camo Black Extra,1.23,i now know why a dog licks his or hers but. you have to get the flavor off some how.
6099,Camo Black Extra,3.53,clear gold with two fingers of white head. some rings of lace. smell is apple and grain. taste is sweet apple or pear juice. some grain no apparent hops. mouthfeel is medium with ample carbonation. finish is dry and sweet. overall a big beer.
6100,Camo Black Extra,3.51,(24 fl. oz can purchased cold... poured into a goose island chalice)  l: crystal-clear brassy gold colored liquid; foam loudly sizzles away upon pour... looks like sparkling apple cider; no lace no collar  s: initial aromatic pop includes sweetness/essence of pale malt leaping forward backed quickly by what can only be described as spiced powdered donut or those pfeffernüsse cookies... standard malt liquor smells with only a mild extra kick of ethanol which as it sits later develops into an almost watery blended-scotch and/or spiked used fryer oil scent... the raw booze does eventually take a lil precedence but the malty wash in each sip snuffs out that sensation  t: malt flavor almost has a lightly-buttery shortbread/sugar-cookie quality - - that hits first but a torrent of spicy sweetish booze charges past leaving a light peppery note up front in the palate while the now vaguely syrupy malt bounces back to the middle of the palate behind the wake of fire... not terribly sweet either balanced enough by the strident booze and/or the carefully-crafted degree of grassy/herbal imported hops added... the more one gets into it the more it tastes like a malt-loaded low-abv apple brandy  f: not too carbonated not all that viscous not much bite from the alcohol - rather dull on the palate but it also doesnt quite feel like its around 12%... id say champagne is more taxing to the senses... gotta get warmed up but this is a walk in the park  o: really not all that bad considering well everything about it... my brother and i during the initial stages of a day-long beer tasting hang-out shared a half a can last week and we both agreed while it wasnt terrible it could be difficult (without training) to get through a whole 24 oz solo... best to drink this from the can and relatively cold... would not be opposed to buying this again if the situation feeling and company called for it - could pair well with some battered whiting and a sweet potato pie; a little greasy mound of collards and a knuckle of corn bread would pull it all together rather splendidly
6101,Camo Black Extra,4.64,goes down about as smooth as silk and it gets you right. smells like a college basement party in northern wisconsin without a single cracked window in sight so i suppose that means it smells like high life or mgd coupled with sweaty baseball caps. i almost tasted alcohol on this one and although other reviewers claim an apple taste id like to claim a significant pear aftertaste. shes a good beer. the can says it uses imported hops as well if that means something to you. only reason she isnt a five is because shes about as flat as a red dog.
6102,Camo Black Extra,1,this is not just the worst beer ive ever had it is the worst beverage product period. flavor pallet includes: vicks cough syrup rotten fruit floor cleaner and wood glue. this is the beer you buy to give to someone you absolutely despise and its murderous hate you buy them 2.
6103,Camo Black Extra,1.41,24 fl oz can. 12.20% abv.  f / avoid
6104,Camo Black Extra,1.9,man this is some gnarly stuff. aroma really wasnt too bad: fruit caramel spice some corn. flavor is super sweet and massive alcohol. body is very heavy and finish was like the aftertaste of sucking on a sugar cube. cant drink this.
6105,Camo Black Extra,1,well the good news is your gonna get ripped! the bad news is everything else.
6106,Camo Black Extra,1.12,i bought two of these (24oz cans for $1.99 each) and i knew they would be terrible but they were worse than i thought. the first one wasnt so bad but by the second one it was too much to handle i ended up puking on the last drink of the last one just trying to force it down.
6107,Camo Black Extra,1.05,i once chewed up dried peyote buttons. later in life i sampled a special mineral water from utah. both these things tasted worse than anything i have ever put in my mouth. the peyote high was awesome though after i threw up.  camo black is right up there with them. i poured it into a frosted glass took a sip and spit it out then poured it down the drain. avoid avoid avoid. it is terrible!
6108,Camo Black Extra,1.84,the sound of the can cracking open is getting me excited. it sounds like someone taking a big bite out of an apple. i’m not going to bother smelling it because it’s malt liquor and it is meant to be slammed. so here we go. i chugged ¼ of the can before my gag reflex decided to come to work. taste sweet as hell and also taste like dynatabe mixed with whiskey. no hiding the alcohol taste in this shit. this shit is revolting putrid. alright got ½ the can before the gag reflex kicked in again and gave me the shivers with goose bumps the taste took my breath away. the label should say camo black extra the malt liquor that fights back. they should have a guarantee of your money back if you can finish the can i doubt very few can. alright at this point with ½ of the can left it’s a battle of who is going to win me or the camo black. i’ll tell you this i ain’t never poured out a beer before but with ½ of the can left staring me down my body gets pissed off at me right now and wants me to give in. this shit kicked my ass. i killed the can but it took me 30min to do it in i must be getting old. i sit and do the math i realized i drank a 6 pack in the form of one can. alright overall the beer is good as a novelty at best. if you’re looking to get drunk then camo black extra is a guarantee. if you can suffer through the pain this beer delivers one hell of a buzz shit one more and i might be in black out mode. if 2 of these cans don’t get you f****d up than you need jesus.
6109,Camo Black Extra,1.5, rjt
6110,Camo Black Extra,5,there is no better description of the perfect beer than this. very efficient very cost effective light on the calories for the punch it packs and the perfect beer for drinking in a trailer park. if you complain about the burn of this you probably should just quit drinking now. this is the perfect compliment to some good ol\ mcnaughton\s whiskey southern comfort or wild turkey. wild turkey chased with camo always reminds me of this scene girl from back in the day who introduced me to heaven\s own blend of the two. you really just dont get much better than camo extra black. the hangover is probably the best part it lasts all of about 15-30 minutes and then youre set to go for the day. two or three cans of this and a fifth of r&r and youre set for a night of graveyard partying streaking and just good old blacked out fun.
6111,Camo Black Extra,1.78,seeing as how camo black ice was just about the shittiest malt liquor to pass these lips it was only fitting to try the extra version to *truly* plumb the depths of the worst beers on the planet. for science. here\s to bad decisions...  bright saturated orange color rapid champagne carbonation thin layer of white foam on the surface that does lace slightly. audibly fizzy foam crackles like rice krispies.  smells like artificial grape flavoring energy drink and flintstones vitamins.  tastes godawful. very harshly astringent vague paper and grape juice flavors descending into utter malaise and ennui. way overcarbonated and fizzy rapidly fades into a numbing boozy aftertaste.  even drinking this as cold as possible doesnt help mask the terrible taste. if you are just looking to get drunk whiskey is a far better option.  delightful story about camo: http://goo.gl/ukrqxu  from the owner: “it’s a unique category that appeals to college students and the ethnic market. it’s definitely skewed toward the male market.”
6112,Juice Jolt,2.22,this is not good beer at all. it\s billed as a juicy ipa but tastes like a cheapo artificially flavored mango lager that\s so prevalent these days. very disappointing.
6113,Juice Jolt,3.8,sweet juicy ipa - very refreshing tastes like a fruit punch
6114,Juice Jolt,3.58,appearance: clean golden amber nice off-white head and no lace.  aroma: straight up fruit punch.  taste: unusual more of the fruit punch. hops and malts almost integrate seamlessly. solid and enjoyable.
6115,Juice Jolt,2.38,best by 12/12/23. poured into a ba 25th ann teku — hell yeah!!  a: mildly hazy orange-amber with 1-finger off-white head with below-average retention and a skimpy line of lacing.  s: aroma is very chemical/artificial and smells like citrus/tropical tums.  t: flavor is also very much like a slurry of citrus and tropical tums into a zima. alcohol flavor adds an unpleasant berry component to the mix.  m: fairly light bodied with high carbonation and chemical extract and tums/aspirin mineral finish.  o: really a poorly executed beer on multiple levels.
6116,Juice Jolt,1.97,looks like beer. kind of. smells like an alcoholic gatorade. taste is like a grapefruit sports drink kids cough syrup. this could possibly be the worst beer i ever had. i’m sad i have 2 more cans of this. will probably pound them here in a few mins just to be rid of them. feels like beer. kind of. yuck.
6117,Juice Jolt,2,awful. tastes terribly artificial. i wouldnt even consider this beer. southern tier you should be ashamed of yourselves. the fact that it has alcohol in it is its only redeeming quality.
6118,Juice Jolt,1.18,i’m not sure what “natural” flavoring they added to this but it smells and tastes very artificial not like beer at all. they really should have to include this stuff on the box.
6119,Juice Jolt,1.37,i just spent an hour in the car listening to chris truskey talk about which pair of stretchy pants he likes the most when we decided to stop in erie for lunch and i had this beer: it was almost as bad as his stories  i’m not sure what the intent here was. it was instantly the worst thing i’ve put in my mouth for some time. it was like a moldy; dying orange fell into the beer tank: it tastes like an old dying woman. i thought maybe it was me but then everyone else hated it as well even chris who was on his second plate of nachos  i like this brewery but they need to get this off the market. it may be the worst beer i’ve ever had even worse than the beer i made at home  phew what a stinker  back in the car. chris is talking about his favorite brand of toilet paper.
6120,Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.56,12oz can courtesy of dimidiata. been sitting on it for a bit and decided it would be an excellent valentine for myself.  poured into a snifter it was the color of the mood of philadelphia eagles fans right now. virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim. not a great looking beer but its not surprising considering how strong it is.  as expected it smells like a big stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels with an unexpected touch of what smells like graham crackers. smells like a luscious dessert.  tastes like it smells but better. its not a subtle beer but you dont drink beers like this for subtlety. the bourbon barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that unlike a lot of beers ive had with vanilla added to it. that graham crackery thing i noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well. i do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer perhaps its a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing. it is utterly delicious thats for sure.  fairly creamy mouth feel body is somewhere between medium and full.  this is a glorious dessert beer. perhaps also my last from modern times. but hey theyre going out on a high note with me. thanks christine!
6121,Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.71,look - black thick nice tan rimmin and lacin smell & taste - loads of barrel along with really nice vanilla and chocolate feel - thick and creamy with a light carb ovrall - fantastic and a must have
6122,Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,5,2020 version poured from a 22oz. bottle into a snifter at home on 12/4/2021. for a vanilla lover like myself the vanilla aroma and flavor as well as the viscosity of this beer is wonderful.
6123,Saison Bernice,4.54,somehow eluding me for over a decade despite several trades with sara locals my first draft pour at good vibes 2023 appears lightly hazy maize yellow-orange with a dense khaki foam blanket that retains well.  this exhibits a surprisingly solid funk thats as if oaked as well as some aged cheese thats cut by an apricot-lemon tartness accented by a refreshing hint of lime.  the fairly crisp body finishes just dry in the swallow.  i can see why this is so well-regarded.
6124,Saison Bernice,4.52,superb appearance in the glass…bright golden yellow color with extremely fine delicate white head. aromas of brett lemon and grassy hay. taste is a burst of lemony tartness and funk. a very light delicate mouthfeel with spritzy carbonation. just about a perfect saison in my book.
6125,Saison Bernice,4.21,poured from a capped 750ml bottle into my troubadour tulip.  nearly clear arylide yellow body with a steady stream of micro-bubbles. off white cap disappears rapidly. almost no lacing nor legs.  subtle complex yeast-driven aromatics suffused with poolish fresh cut hay and stone fruit. floral with a whisper of white wine/champagne.  bright with a balance of light grain/malt tart meyer lemon/unripe pear and a faint peppery/barnyard edge from the brett. light clean bitterness with a touch of alfalfa and clover. long medium-dry finish reveals full maturation and synergy of ingredients.  a bit thin and fizzy with lingering acidity. what meager roundness is present seems almost (but not quite) chalky.  excellent aroma and flavor a core expression from the brewery but the body is more like a lambic than a saison - perhaps this was not a great bottle/batch but at the price point im not eager to roll the dice again right away.
6126,Saison Bernice,4.7,brief review:  o: my first sara beer here very lucky to grab this from sf on a trip this past april. been hearing a lot of great things about them for years. really digging this. very clean light complex. just a slight funk not overly tart. great carbonation and mouthfeel. dont have much to compare it to from the brewery but as far as saisons and wild ales go this is certainly top notch.  recommendation: definitely on par with some things ive had from hf this is a really good beer from an awesome brewery.
6127,Rosé De Gambrinus,4.32,deep ruby red body mostly clear forming a short-lived rose-pink head fizzling aggressively to nothing in seconds. lush juicy fragrant raspberry wafting from the glass along with a touch of light red wine some dark cherry. sharply tart and burning acidity accompanied by sophisticated barrel-aged berry juice - raspberry cherry red currant; its bright but not juicy tangy and a touch of must; low carbonation super fine and a medium body; feel is sticky; the fruit and lactic acid lingers long through the semi-dry finish.  a sophisticated fruity flavourful lambic top notch! 2021 vintage
6128,Rosé De Gambrinus,4.45,a: pours a clear medium purplish red in color with light to moderate amounts of very fine active visible carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and moderate ruby red + garnet red colored highlights. the beer has a two finger tall dense fizzy foamy pale pink colored head that quickly reduces to a large patch of thin film covering the entire surface of the beer and thin ring at the edges of the glass. minimal amounts of lacing are observed.  s: slightly stronger than moderate aromas of slightly sour wheat + pale malts with minimal amounts of sweetness. moderate aromas of slightly sour lacto lemon citrus along with a moderate aroma of slightly funky barnyard + horse blanket. light aromas of tart raspberries.  t: upfront there are moderate flavors of slightly sour wheat + pale malts with minimal amounts of sweetness. that is followed by slightly stronger than moderate flavors of slightly sour lacto lemon citrus and slightly stronger than moderate flavors of funky barnyard + horse blanket. finally there are light to moderate flavors of tart raspberries. moderate amounts of lingering acidic tartness.  m: light bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. moderate to heavy amounts of acidic prickliness.  o: easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly prickly acidic tart mouthfeel. extremely enjoyable with great tart sour and funky flavors along with raspberry without any of the associated sweetness of other examples of raspberry lambics.
6129,Rosé De Gambrinus,4.28,on tap at singular in bilbao. 9.5a: glorious deep ruby. no head but some lacing. 7s: we have got some weird flavors in here. pretty funky tart but just enough putrefaction to cause the occasional grimace. 9t: nailed it. bright fruit cold beer perfect finish. rather brief maintaste but the strike and the finish are excellent. 10m: light tart excellent. both lingers and effervesces. 8.50: ultimately its the flash in the pan of the dazzling burst of flavor that disappoints somewhat along with that unmucked stall note. otherwise: excellent.
6130,Rosé De Gambrinus,4.76,bottle at biercafe au trappiste in bern. poured out a clear reddish pink color with a small off-white head of foam. it left minimal lacing on the glass. it smelled of raspberry green apple and some subtle lemon. great sweet raspberry taste with a sour punch. this may be the best lambic ive ever had.
6131,Rosé De Gambrinus,4.81,found a bottle of this while lost in amsterdam. cheers to the friendly staff at in de wildeman.  fresh fruity funkadelic masterpiece.
6132,Rosé De Gambrinus,4.5,raul isn’t realy into that superhuman stuff but i’m gonna assume that this one bangs like thor’s hammer - i’m talking large and in charge. rosé de gambrinus just shows up to the party and doesn’t need to ring the door bar because he’s welcome at any time. it’s smooth it’s ripe and it’s sophisticated without trying.  oh my.
6133,La Folie,4.21,tasted from a 500 ml corked bottle in a red wine glass.  l - beautiful ruby red color and very clear. light tan head fades quickly to a thick ring around the glass and a few wisps on the surface. swirling the beer reveals light lacing and legs on the glass like a strong wine shows.  s - nose is an interesting blend of sweet brown ale with red wine and berry notes and a sharp acidic note with some barnyard funk at a low level.  t - the barnyard funk and sour acidity dominate the flavors but is some depth that reveals other flavors. i get blackberry jam and oak but the base of flemish brown ale is not detectable to me.  f - thin body with low carbonation. hops bitterness is not detectable because the acidic sourness is so strong it masks any other sensation on the tongue. it also give a sharp bite in the throat. alcohol presence is also drowned out by the acid except for some esters detectable in the finish.  o - this is an unabashedly funky and sour beer but totally over the top compared to the belgian versions of flemish brown ive had. still this does have delicate touches that make it more than just a sour monster.
6134,La Folie,3.6,balanced a little apple taste.
6135,La Folie,4.13,straight down the middle sour. funky apple vinegar oak and cherry. good carbonation and finishes dry. earthy with barnyard grass malt oak barrel vanilla spicy caramel malt red wine hay and grape. sour but not overly so. the finish has a brown ale malty bluntness. i went to college in boulder but this is my first time having this beer. i see why it it is an american classic of searching for european greatness.
6136,La Folie,3.96,la folie  new belgium brewing company  sour-flanders oud bruin  the classic sour. produced way before it was mainstream popular. this aged sour had tangy apple metallic sharp earthy funk cherries and amber malt aspects. the french barrel flavor and feel is very mellow and provides an excellent subtle depth.  4.00
6137,La Folie,4.75,great example of the style. well balanced and delicious! just the right amount of sour and a wonderful depth of flavor. just right for a before dinner quaff. i love this beer!
6138,La Folie,4.93,sour taste apple  vinegar funky dry finish high carb. all good for this style.
6139,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,1.02,taste like s**t.
6140,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,2.7,not the worst taste for price and %. hard on the stomach and body. toxic.
6141,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,4.74,fucking amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! there is no better beer on the market.
6142,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,3.06,as of august 13th 2016 they changed the size of the can now its 236 ml was 250ml . now it taste even stronger the price also went up\ufeff/ strong taste of alcohol jst like taking a shot of vodka  smooth smell  smooth aftertaste worth the price because its cheap shit . good for a nice summer day and on a budget. stronger then it use to be might be less water in a smaller can not sure worth a try nothing special if u want a special beer buy craft brews
6143,Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots,2.63,purchased at the lcbo as a single and served at 4deg c in a draught glass.  a- opens well and pours a 1 high white head that lasts a minute before film out. light to medium gold colour and filtered clear  s- not much here at all. really bad scent like a metal can  t- not so good. not so happy. just an alcohol bomb.  m- a north american brew that has a niche... people that dont have time or the stomach to drink good brew. bet you its people that a stopping on the side of the highway to slam two beer as its a different charge to drink a brew while driving but stopping and pounding two outside the car is not dui lol  food pairing  this not so great beer went well with...... i dont know. its just a brew designed to slug and drive or slug and whatever. lol  enjoy if you can!!!!
6144,Hahn Super Dry,2.7,not the most exciting beer with minimal flavour but easy enough to drink.
6145,Hahn Super Dry,3.12,an enhanced brewing process breaks down more of the natural sugars to deliver a genuine super dry taste with only a third of the carbs of standard full strength beer.this beer goes down quite easy.
6146,Hahn Super Dry,1.64,australian budweiser. flat taste with a chemical-esque finish. would not recommend.
6147,Hahn Super Dry,2.93,sweet grain bread and a bit of an apple
6148,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.06,nov. 2010: 330 ml bottle brewed by eschweger abv in norway is 4.7%. bought at meny stadionparken. crystal clear extremely pale yellow colour big white head. grainy aroma of unhopped pilsener wort and boiled vegetables not good. sweet and sugary flavour hardly any bitterness. what a stupid idea - brewing a purposely shitty american standard pale lager in europe just because homer simpson would have liked it ... taste is nothing marketing is everything.
6149,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.85,brewed in germany so must adhere to the purity law one would imagine.  i thought this stuff would be terrible as it is obviously a gimmick however i was pleasantly surpisred. the beer is okay with half decent flavour nothing to write home about though.  the packaging states that the beer is a lagerbier hell which would suggest it is a munich helles style beer.
6150,Very HHHazyyy,4.6,l - opaque hazy orange/yellow with a thin creamy white head that dissipates quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing s - orange mango passion fruit peaches piney resinous hops t - follows the nose - tons of orange and peach upfront with a little bit of passion fruit and mango intermixed well with resinous piney hops f - full bodied with light carbonation. smooth soft fluffy o - a fantastic neipa - one of the benchmarks for the style - a little more nuance to the flavor profile compared to emperor julius
6151,Very HHHazyyy,4.59,on tap at the tewksbury location. sublimely smooth white packing an absolute ton of dank yummy citrus and fruit. ive really run out of superlatives for th sauce these days. yum!!
6152,Very HHHazyyy,4.53,look - nice thick honey orange with a thick frothy white head and sticky smell - orange peach but not as much as i was expecting taste - nice blend between orange ripe peach mango (in that order) with a very slight bite feel - medium body creamy with a slight carb. nice mouth coating sticks to it all. overall - really a fantastic beer. wish the smell was more but all and all fantastic
6153,Very HHHazyyy,4.67,what th says on the can i 100% agree. very hqzy is one of my top rated beers from th and in my taste bud opinion this is better. i lucked out on 5/18 when i was at the tree and this was available. yay o’yay. great beer and i hope it’s available on one of my few trips to th.
6154,Very HHHazyyy,4.64,if you like prototypical hazy ipas this is the one. super soft on the pallette. ripe stone fruits and pineapple abound something like an umbrella drink. truly a sensational beer that somehow stands apart from the rest.
6155,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.21,purchased as part of a 4 pack from goshen beverage in west chester pa on 6/29/23.  l- pitch black with a very delicate head.  s- bba notes very forward: vanilla caramel.  t- beautiful bourbon but not over- powering. some “boozy “ heat very delicate stout flavors on the back end.  f- rather light mouthfeel. very delicate carbonation.  o- a great ba imperial stout!
6156,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.26,l: dark brown with some light sneaking through the edges very thick; slight tan head with some lacing s: barrel including some oak caramel and vanilla notes with a touch of barley chocolate and vague dark berry t: fudgy up front not just chocolate but thick fudge with nice drying from woody notes and no letup from some sweet vanilla toffee and caramel notes all the way through; a bit of those dark fruits linger throughout f: not as thick as it looks more of a medium body; it would be better if it didnt thin out a touch as it went but pretty good from front to back
6157,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.32,nice deep color but not pitch black. head dissipated quickly. noticeable carbonation.  good smell. a bit sweet. very pleasant.  very tasty. smooth a bit of sweetness but not too much. i like the carbonation.  overall a very good stout.
6158,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,3.88,appearance: pours a completely dark black color with a strong dark tan head. srm of 23-24. (4.00)  aroma: strong aromas of bourbon upfront. this mixes into a chocolate sweet caramel and bread pudding aromas. aromas are rich and sweet. (4.00)  flavor: strong flavors of bourbon again upfront. theres a strong bourbon and boozy bite in the middle before it melds into a warm caramel maple syrup and bread pudding flavors that lingers at the end. sweet. (3.75)  feel: heavier bodied mild carbonation. strong and sweet with a booze and bourbon bite. (3.75)  overall: heavy on the bourbon here and im sure a great stout. a little too much bourbon and booze flavor for my taste but still has some nice warm and rich flavors off the end. caramel maple syrup bread pudding. sort of reminds me of an imperial backwoods bastard. the heavy bourbon isnt my forte but okay. (rating: 3.88)
6159,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.31,poured from a twelve ounce bottle the body is a deep brown or black. one finger of a light tan head and good lacing.  aroma is the barrel vanilla chocolate and dark fruit (a bit of cherries).  taste follows nose with an assertive bourbon flavor and some oak chocolate dark fruit and malty char. at the end of swallow a light bitterness appears. as the stout warms everything softens. wonderful.  creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation. not the thickest stout feel but flavor more than makes up for it.  a top notch barrel aged stout.
6160,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.14,a nice tan head sits atop a dark body. very pleasant aroma: bourbon the sweet scent of fermented malt vanilla brown sugar & implied happiness. only the slightest bit sweet with a touch of saltiness. flavor is everything promised by the aroma with some complex barrel flavors. as thick as expected but a bit thin on carbonation. an excellent stout.
6161,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.71,12-oz bottle into samuel smith pint glass vintage 2019  a - 3 fingers of deep tan over a pitch black body with orange/ruby highlights  s - sweet malts a little milky a touch of metallic some chocolate wood and other delightful complexities of bourbon; marvelous!  t - sweet malt and chocolate alcohol warmth in the back wood/bourbon/vanilla in the finish; complex and delightful!  m - smooth oily medium/full body low carbonation  o - just excellent
6162,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.4,purchased at bound beverage warrington pa. $18/4pk  pours a jet black totally opaque color. a very light skim of a head on the initial pour.  aromas of sweet malts chocolate and bourbon. smells delicious.  the first sip follows the aroma with a sweet malty chocolate taste with a distinct bourbon background. slightly acidic aftertaste. the bourbon aging is done perfectly as it never overpowers the beer. the abv is lurking there but isn’t dominate.  a rich smooth creamy mouthfeel. leaves a nice coating in the mouth. medium carbonation.  overall a delicious stout that ranks up there with the best. a beer that truly highlights what a stout can be with the proper barrel aging and care that central waters has given this brew…highly recommended. cheers!
6163,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.09,appearance: pours a very dark brown body with a medium-small-sized light khaki-colored head.  smell: a sliver of char with woodsy bourbon-moist barrel tones leading to bittersweet chocolate morsels smooth roast and brown sugar with a slight fruitiness of blueberry blackberry.  taste: sweetish chocolaty with plenty of warming oaken spiced woodsy bourbon tones a bit charry and ashen. more brown sugar and again the softly tangy fruitiness but its fairly well-integrated as in its not ganky-level sweet or housing a jolt of fruitiness. final zip of fruitiness sweetness and heat though it wraps up reasonably dry for a big stout.  mouthfeel: medium-plus body. medium-light carbonation. just a bit chewy though far from being gummy or gloopy.  overall: it houses a sound richness yet the beer is surprisingly well-attenuated tasty and tight in its overall execution.
6164,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.09,black in color with minimal light penetration. theres a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering half of the top. the aroma is packed with dark malt and oak. im tasting cola and oak. the mouth is smooth and thick.
6165,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.02,look - nice looking super dark with a great tan head and lacing smell- woody bourbon with a slight dark chocolate taste - woody bourbon dark chocolate like the smell fairly standard bba stout. slight bitterness and boozy feel - medium full body with a light carb overall - pretty standard bba imperial stout
6166,Coconut Vibes,4.43,while i wanted more coconut up front this was an amazingly complex beer everywhere else; phenomenal mouthfeel incredible flavors.
6167,Mornin' Delight,5,i dont know about first thing in morning ... but then again ...
6168,Mornin' Delight,4.25,on tap at o’shea homebrew in san juan capistrano ca.  if the sugar plum fairy and cookie monster made a baby i’m sure this is what mrs. plum fairy would lactate. i mean damn…we are talking sweet. that said it’s all kinds of balanced and on point like nailing a bullseye at darts before you drain your first beer… what is raul getting at here? yeah he doesn’t play darts. md is good but not raul’s thing. i guess that’s what i meant. happy to try it (unlike my one and only time at raising canes) but i’ll happily move on after having it.
6169,Mornin' Delight,4.7,what\s not to like about this beer? from the time i opened it until i finished the last sip the aroma in the room was that of maple and coffee! it was like a dessert being prepared before you and the scent lingering in trying to attract you. it\s mouthwatering to an extent. this is one of those things in life that tastes just like it smells. delight is exactly what it is! i am thankful they upped the limits this year because it\s hard to keep my hands off the bottles when i open the fridge. cheers!
6170,Mornin' Delight,4.71,appearance - the beer was black in appearance with a smooth body that showed little visible carbonation and a modest tan head.  smell - pancakes were immediately brought to mind with notes of coffee and maples syrup in the nose. it was like breakfast for dinner.  taste - as with the nose it was like breakfast for dinner. the maple syrup seemed to saturate the stout permeating the body. the beer was not overly sweet but was balanced by the coffee notes. it seemed as though the coffee was washing down the sweetness. notes of semi-sweet chocolate same toward the back but the overall profile of chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup lingered.  mouthfeel - the body was thick but not quite motor oil quality. this made the beer more drinkable than the average heavy stout. carbonation was still very present.  overall - the beer was definitely hype worth. unlike some other tg beers it was relatively easy to obtain.
6171,Mornin' Delight,4.74,2022 variant - bottle split 4 ways - pours a a rich black with a nice mocha foam into a tulip. overpowering maple on the nose and was a little worried that this was going to be too sweet for me and too much of a dessert stout but the taste was so well balanced - maple sweetness was well calmed by the roasty coffee and bakers chocolate flavor.  while md was easier to obtain this year from a volume perspective this was not a cheap bottle to get to pittsburgh haha - overall - well worth it and while some of the shine might have worn off this beer nationally given its more readily available its still a world class pour. glad i have a bottle left.
6172,Cara Pils,5,wonderful belgian pils always very handy when youre broke as a nigga. would definitely recommend.
6173,Cara Pils,1.3,i drank a can of this beer at a friends place he hated them but didnt want to throw them away. it is a beer generally drunk by homeless people on the street to give you an idea. it looks like a regualr pils beer although much lighter. it has a very unfresh smell and the flavor is awful. cant really put my finge rto what it is eaxctly but i never tatsed something like that before. the beer also leaves a very penetrating flavor and felling in the mouth definitely the worst beer i ever drank.
6174,Cara Pils,1.69,cara pils is generally drank because it is the cheapest beer available in the belgian market. thus is carries a bit of a stigma in belgium. people drink this for the sale purpose of getting drunk as cheaply as possible when they have absolutely no money. it is crap but it is ridiculously cheap. i mean really really cheap buying an equal amount of water at the supermarket costs more money than this beer.  second note i believe that piedboeuf doesn’t brew this. no one actually brews cara pils they just buy this stuff from whatever brewery makes it the cheapest. sometimes contracts change i have heard that they put failed batches from several pils brewers into this stuff probably including stuff from piedboeuf. the french brewery champigneulles (tcb beverages) who specializes in this kinds of beers most likely makes most of this stuff these days.  review: bright clear golden urine-coloured with little brief white head. musty wet corn in the nose hay dirty water rotting lemon… watery corn wet and dusty rotting hay light rotting touch metallic rotting lemon expired medication unnerving bitterness… bitter disgusting aftertaste. wattery. not very good touch better than expected.
6175,Cara Pils,2.52,this belgian cult-pilsener is not as bad as you would expect. its cheap and has a bad image. but compared to world famous beers like heineken it can still hold its own. on any given summer sunday i prefer an ice cold cara over most popular pilseners.  sure the taste is not great it tastes somewhere in between foul and average but at the bargain price of 026€/33cl this is to be expected. bad image aside this is just a regular pilsener which would be much better liked if it was branded better.
6176,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.63,i love this beer !!!!!
6177,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.21,pours out of the bottle a deep brown color with a finger of head and mild retention. smells like cocoa roasted malts and coffee. tastes slightly bitter to begin but then gets taken by the dry chocolate flavor. nice inoffensive carbonation that provides a nice robust mouthfeel. really nice.
6178,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.76,one of the best beers i have ever had. such a great look the feel is so smooth and easy to drink. the taste is bitter like black coffee but makes sure you feel great drinking it. it is a very good beer
6179,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.53,pours from a bottle into a guinness glass dark brown-black like coca-cola. tan head maybe an inch dissolves but doesn’t disappear. (like a relationship that goes on after the thrill is gone.)  i can’t smell much (bad air in the 513). floral-y with some alcohol smell.  tastes good. dark. bitter like dark and burnt and broodingly regretful like the remnants of my broken heart or real (black dark-dark-roast) coffee. has an aftertaste like coke only without the acid. as it warms up just some hints of caramely-sweet in the aftertaste that aren’t there in front. the sweet stays on my lips. (“if she only…” says my broken heart.)  feels lighter than it looks. a little carbonated. drinks fast and easy. i was done with it before i wanted to be. (“tell me about it” says my broken heart.)  overall: a very very good beer. very good. like my own personal standard for what a dark beer not called guinness can be.
6180,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.26,color: almost black with a thick and creamy head smell: dark chocolate and coffee are predominant with some malt and toffee sweetness underneath taste: bitter coco and coffee malt and a tiny bit of sweet peeking through feel: holds up well with good texture and mouthfeel highly drinkable would recommend
6181,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.79,excellent beer. very dark. i love it. recommend trying it. i found this at earth fare got a six pack for $6.99. has lots of head to it. definitely can taste the malt and hops in it. much better than any of those light beers i’ve had.
6182,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.5,pours a clear black/brown with glints of red. on top is a foamy tan head with good lacing. notes of caramel brown sugar chocolate coffee and herbal hops round out the nose. the flavor is smooth and rich for a brew that is surprisingly light on the palate. hop flavor and bitterness is subdued and the malt really shines with warm caramel and chocolate flavors. medium bodied with a crisp finish. overall i guess i am a little taken aback as i always thought this was more of a big robust porter from hearing about it. in reality it is a much more quaffable session-able take on the style than i always thought. much like great lakes lagers the level and complexity of the beers malt flavor is much more than one would typically find. this is a very refined drinkable and delicious dark beer. definitely deserving of being compared to deschutes black butte sierra nevada porter and other classics.
6183,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.79,i have a tough time finding this beer in missouri. but i think one of the best porters i have ever tried.
6184,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.23,updated with review in march 2023.  format and age: 12oz bottle gifted best by april 22 2023.  cold chain: somewhat unknown. transported cold after receiving it and kept in fridge at home.  impressions: pours very dark brown with red edges and a one-finger tan head. aromas of chocolate and roast coffee dominate. the taste starts with a big kick of bitter chocolate that sweetens as it lingers in the mouth. progresses to notes of dark roast coffee and burnt toast with some dark fruit on the finish and aftertaste. as it warms the dark fruits come out more while the bitter and burnt characteristics recede a bit. medium bodied with moderate carbonation resulting in a smooth feel.  overall: a great porter. great lakes did a good job keeping the bitterness in check while retaining that quintessential porter profile and making it more thab just a roast bomb. definitely my favorite since having everett quite a few years ago now.
6185,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3,tastes better than corona.  style: mexican lager | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 4.4% | rating: 3.5
6186,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,4.18,clear light golden beer. active carbonation. big fluffy head that does not stick around for long.  neutral aroma. very mild. not much there. some bread.  smooth. mild sweetness. somewhat malty. more bitterness than is typical for this style of beer. bitterness lingers on the palate. a little bit lemony. a touch of adjunct corn flavor.  body is on the border of light and medium. satisfying. chuggable but not thin.  ive been drinking a lot of this beer lately. it is very good. but overpriced. the quality is better than most other mexican adjunct lagers. quality is way above american adjunct lagers. ice cold it is a smooth enjoyable flavorful lager to down in hot weather. a lot better than most of the competition. the balance is spot on. tastes like beer not corn / rice juice. better than corona or budweiser. i like it more than heineken. a very solid choice for lager.
6187,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.28,clara looks clear and clean. decent thick head. smells decent for being very light. no strong flavors and on the light side. easy drinking enough you could make a session beer out of it until you’re ready for a stronger brew. it’s good enough. i’d buy it i guess.
6188,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.69,my favorite hot summer day beer. crisp light sessionable. not a world class beer but as far as mass produced goes...not many other beers come to mind for refreshing and accessible.
6189,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,4.63,one of my favorite mexican beers. very refreshing to drink at the beach. in my opinion way better than corona and modelo.
6190,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,1.76,clear light gold appearance with a fairly large white head and modest lacing. cooked corn aroma that goes downhill as it warms. not many ways to describe the bland taste other than that i did not have to spit it out. light bodied lively carbonated mouthfeel. going to try again? doubtful.
6191,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.52,12oz brown bottle. neck of bottle is stamped bb aug 2023. clear pale gold colored body. one finger of white head. leaves behind scattered strings of lacing. aroma of grain malts and a touch of floral hops. taste is sweet malt with a toasted white bread note. has a spice note along with floral hops. sweet malt in the aftertaste. thinner mouth feel. good carbonation. crisp and clean lager experience. made to allow for several beers to be imbibed in a session. smells and tastes like a malt beverage but does not go to any extremes.
6192,Stroh's Light,4.04,for a light beer it has body and a good taste and smell. the flavor last unlike most light beers . its a damn good light beer!
6193,Stroh's Light,2.25,strohs light light lager 3.82% - clear pale yellow gold color with a frothy white cap of foam thin light lager aroma and taste with mild corn and grains. cheers!
6194,Stroh's Light,2,a-pours a golden color with a slight head and lacing a-aroma has lemongrass hints t-the taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor m-a medium bodied decently carbonated beer o-a decent beer
6195,Stroh's Light,1.5,strohs light.  if i remember correctly the original strohs was one of the blandest beers to have ever crossed my lips long ago when i was still in college and actually had friends who were off getting engaged and crawling up their fiances ass to die until the inevitable divorce. anyway this joins the story as the last beer. not sure its even brewed anymore but its here and in front of me right now so it shall get a drinkin.  look - crystal clear yellow with a big ass heavily frothy white head that splits like a wanna be gangsta dad finding out his one night stand is knocked up. carbonation looks cripplingly high and painful. no lacing as the head didnt retain for long enough. 1.5.  smell - rice like adjuncts all over the place with a dosage of seltzer and mineral water. 1.5.  taste - prettttyyyy much the same. rice adjuncts and seltzer water. 1.5.  feel - heavily carbonated with a very watery nearly unbearable body. 1.5.  overall - how can you take something like strohs and make it even lighter..i really didnt see a difference between this and the original. both painfully bland and not worth the cool labels on the can. 1.5.
6196,Michelob Honey Lager,2.26,l: not quite yellow-orange almost a dark gold; lots of clarity plenty of carb with a small head that keeps up a thin layer for a minute and leaves very light lacing s: dust all kinds of grains and sweetness; a little floral hops? t: very much the same sweetness at least isnt cloying though mingles with grains in the finish; husky f: obviously thin lots of carbonation but no depth of any kind; body has no real balancing dryness to it o: it is what it is; some appreciation for beer would be nice of the brewers to employ
6197,Michelob Honey Lager,2.39,has a little bit of obscuring clarity particles going through it other than that it is in the solid yellow range with 1/5 white head. the aroma did give off sweetness as its first (and only?) component in the aroma department.  taste keeps dropping sweetness too much out of balance not tasting the beercentric stuff just adjunct like sweetness. lots of carbonation. lacking malt hops yeast flavors. nothing balanced about it despite the commercial hand job. do they still make this? it just doesnt resonate with me.
6198,Michelob Honey Lager,4,
6199,Schaefer,2.26,this was once upon a time a fairly decent typical american beer. you know it\s the kind of beer you\d have at a picnic maybe mowing the lawn sitting on the front steps yapping with some buddies while having a cold one... drinkable but in no way special. well it seems a tad lesser quality than even back then. very light yellow small short lasting head very light corn and barley taste. dont blink youll miss the hops! in a nutshell not a very good beer even at its inexpensive price of about 17 bucks a 30 pack! better off with hamms or keystone light (yep... its that bad) if you want some cheap brewskis.
6200,Schaefer,2.86,not bad but nothing to write home about. your value priced lawn mowing beer.
6201,Schaefer,3.08,this isn’t bad for an adjunct lager. it looks like p*ss and smells similar. has a corniness on the nose and a bright yellow color. it tastes good though. very smooth and not cloying. can’t beat it for $17.49 a 30 pack!
6202,Schaefer,2.48,310 ml can (10.5 oz). label says puerto rico on it not sure why as the label also indicates it was brewed in milwaukee.  drank on the beach in st john usvi so all that mattered was that it was wet and cold. not much more to say very mild pale malt flavor thin and fizzy mouthfeel.
6203,Schaefer,2.18,light refreshing for tinted water and very mild. this thing drinks quick inoffensive and utterly forgettable. there is nothing off here just simple light lager. if you’re hot and thirsty go for it.
6204,Schaefer,2.53,a 12 oz. can poured into a clear pint glass shows a very pale straw colored almost clear liquid. theres very little head glass lacing nor aroma. there is some taste but its mostly yeasty. considering the category at least there is some taste. this brand probably tasted better decades ago. the puerto rican version definitely was.
6205,Schaefer,3.22,**mandatory discussion based on trying a few 6-packs years in the past.  schaefer was one of the brews available from regional brewers when i lived in madison wi from 1973-78. imo even that many years ago schaefer was not that popular b/c there were too many other options available and the taste and smell were for diehard fans only.  around 1977 or so miller lite came on the local scene and took a huge market away from the regional brews like schaefers.
6206,Schaefer,4.47,the best aal on the market.
6207,Schaefer,1.45,tastes like the metal bleachers of the stadium that used to bear its name. literally any other beer would be better than this. the one beer to have when you’re having more than one. no thanks. i’ll have none.
6208,Schaefer,2.75,drank a lot in college stole a lot from my dad. 4.6% great session brew! none of the floral i remember. rather corny taste decent bitter. ok for cheap beer.
6209,Schaefer,4.94,i grew up in the ‘70s with all my family enjoying schaefer and it is still the favorite beer of my extended family. great beer!
6210,Schaefer,2.86,best by 7/22/19  pours a golden straw topped with an ample thick white foam; slowly receding retention leaves layers of splotchy lacing and a fading cap and collar.  aromas show muddled grainy notes and some fresh straw with a minor corn sweetness almost overshadowed entirely by an oncoming presence of grassy hops; bouquet has a quiet pop to it.  taste lots of grain and a light honeyed sweetness throughout the profile while grassy hops come in late to give a rounded quality; finishes quickly with hints of a somewhat unpleasant metallic tone lingering.  mouthfeel holds a light body that holds nicely until the back end where it becomes a bit watery; smooth carbonation with a progressive prickle on the palate and a decent crispness overall; finish thins and fades quickly.  solid essentially inoffensive aal with a developing grain character and reinforcing hoppy prickle; somewhat inconsistent overall to be a go-to but id have no problem returning to this one if the situation called for it.
6211,Schaefer,2.25,another high school and college era beer. was never the first second or even third choice. but it was readily available and cheap. again not the worst ive drank but easily closer to the bottom than the top.
6212,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,2.85,brewers notes: taj mahal is the beer for the serious connoisseur. the label on the bottle depicts the heavenly beauty of its namesake. as is appropriate taj mahal is brewed from only the finest water grain hops and yeast. it is a delicious and refreshing drink to the utmost! a cool tall six hundred and fifty milliliter bottle of taj mahal is the best way to refresh after a long day of work… or with a particularly spicy meal. taj mahal is as monumental among the beers of the world as its namesake is to the country of india.  first indian beer gift from my well intended brother in law who knows i like craft beers …i appreciate the attempt  clear golden liquid  occasional carbonation streams  three finger frothy white foam crown spotty lacings  aroma is faint grains  taste is beer flavored water  clean crisp mouthfeel  lawn mower beer on a hot summer day  the brewers notes are definite hyperbole from hydrrbad  nice beer
6213,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.96,not so bad as the avg score here would imply. decent balanced flavors and nice malt presence. totally inoffensive to my tastes and only complaint being that its a bit thin and watery. otherwise glad i tried this one.
6214,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.55,united breweries taj mahal premium lager 4.5% abv. pours clear yellow with a 3-finger off-white head that left some lacing. nose is malty. taste follows some grain light hop bitterness. decent mouthfeel if a bit over-carbonated. overall very good.
6215,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.17,l: pours pale straw yellow with a small white head and no lacing on the glass.  s: fresh toasted grain mixes with a sweet cereal malt and light hop.  t: sweet cereal malt and some toasted grain and a light hop. definitely tastes like a light lager.  f: light and crisp  o: definitely trending on the cheaper side but still decent.
6216,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,2.64,had a few large bottles over the course of 30+ years. it is best served very cold and in a small glass. compliments food pretty well esp indian & latino cuisine. it is fairly light bodied transparent light yellow ok carbo a thin white fast dissipating head that goes quickly to edge foam light spotty lacing. has a light grassy aroma with some grains. taste is fairly refreshing with grassy lightly dry hops and gentle malts. thin feel and a slightly dry finish. fast easy drinking beer. reminds me of amstel light.
6217,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.36,had out of 22 oz bottle at india house portland or
6218,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,2.65,gold in color with a fingernail of dishwater white around the rim and covering a third of the top. the aroma is sulfur and light grains. i’m tasting light grains. the mouth is very light and easygoing.
6219,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.1,very light in most senses of the word. no offensive tastes or smells. a slight chlorine-y hopps.
6220,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.07,650 ml bottle poured into a tumbler style pint glass. bottled 8/21  l: gold clear and effervescent one inch stark white head fades to a ring in a minute and a half. s: skunk giving way to light floral hops and caramel malt. t: malty and medium sweet caramel malt very little hop hint of skunk at times. f: highly carbonated has a crisp bite light body bite may be a little harsh at times. o: better than expected (especially for its age) decent enough to quench your thirst on a hot day. not bad for an aged adjunct lager.
6221,Nightmare On Brett Raspberry,3.53,750 ml corked & caged bottle from vinmonopolet nettbutikken. abv is 9.666%. black colour moderate tan head. aroma of ripe and over-ripe raspberries. sour flavour of raspberries lemons and lactic acid. only a hint of oak and whiskey.
6222,Nightmare On Brett Raspberry,4.07,this one pours a dark reddish color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells very raspberry forward still with some light red wine vinegar lemon jammy berry and oak.  this is wildly tart and acidic but its still honestly pretty tasty. theres loads of jammy but extremely tart raspberry character with most of the sweetness fermented out. theres red wine barrel and also red wine vinegar with lemon rind and intense funk.  this is light bodied with a long and very lingering sourness. its a slow sipper.  i think this bottle is from 2013 (perhaps) and its held up nicely.
6223,Nightmare On Brett Raspberry,4.41,look - really dark with a slight red and a nice tan head and lacing smell - so much tart raspberry taste - tart raspberry feel - medium body light carb overall - really tasty with lots of raspberry
6224,Nightmare On Brett Raspberry,4.56,pours like all others in series: medium black with a brown head moderate carbonation that dies down. smell just explodes with fresh raspberry both the skin and fruit with a mellow whiskey backing brett and general funk berries and dark fruit. taste is lead by the raspberry as well but now more puree like with blackberry pomegranate plum tootsie roll and date before huge brett funk wood and whiskey sweep you up to the slightly sour finish. feel is slightly tart/sour with brett wood booze and funk helping shape. the raspberry while adding a great dynamic to smell and taste does smooth over the complex body a bit compared to others in the series
6225,Nightmare On Brett Raspberry,4.47,appearance: pours coffee colored with ruby highlights around the edge; the one finger head slowly fades to a film leaving spotty lacing  smell: rapsberry jam and a vinous oaky red wine character; the tartness is apparent as is a hint of chocolate  taste: the raspberry combines with the underlying acetic character of the beer creating a puckery aspect; oak and vague hints of whiskey and chocolate emerge after the swallow; the finish is dry and tart  mouthfeel: medium to full body with moderate carbonation  overall: now this is more like it - after having been somewhat disappointed in the base and apple whiskey versions this one comes through with complexity and carbonation; after five years in the bottle it is quite impressive
6226,Nightmare On Brett Raspberry,4.5,a: poured into a duvel tulip to an essentially black beer topped by a dense and slightly rocky finger of tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing. s: smells of intense raspberries and funk with a touch of roasted malt and chocolate t: taste is raspberries and dark chocolate with some nice building sourness along with a solid amount of funk. on the swallow theres more chocolate and raspberries with a good amount of sourness and bright fruit notes with some light roasted malt and dark chocolate that lingers at the very back end. m: this beer has a moderate amount of body but it is slightly on the lighter side. carbonation is effervescent without being prickly while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity. o: overall this one is awesome. great fruit flavors and a nice baseline of complexity from the base beer. this is definitely an interesting beer to drink and one to try if youre a fan of the style.
6227,Vanilla Porter,4,poured from a 12-oz can well within its date range into a snifter (we’re camping and snifters are all we have with us).  appearance: amber brown with a 1” light tan head that dissipated pretty quickly but left adequate lacing.  nose: medium roast fresh stone and dried fruit.  mouthfeel: medium smooth sufficient carbonation.  attack: medium roast malt vanilla.  finish: hop bitterness to balance.  overall: not as intensely flavored as most porters but very easy drinking; this is a sessionable porter. very reminiscent of a leinenkugel snowdrift vanilla porter. i’d buy it again in a heartbeat — absolutely our poured from a 12-oz can well within its date range into a snifter (we’re camping and snifters are all we have with us).  appearance: amber brown with a 1” light tan head that dissipated pretty quickly but left adequate lacing.  nose: medium roast fresh stone and dried fruit.  mouthfeel: medium smooth sufficient carbonation.  attack: medium roast malt vanilla.  finish: hop bitterness to balance.  overall: not as intensely flavored as most porters but very easy drinking; this is a sessionable porter. very reminiscent of a leinenkugel snowdrift vanilla porter. i’d buy it again in a heartbeat — absolutely our favorite of the several breckenridge beers we sampled in our create-your-own sixpack..
6228,Vanilla Porter,3.39,from a mixed 15 pak of 12 oz cans poured into a chilled pint glass. pours a deep clear reddish brown color with a faint off white head that quickly dissipates and leaves behind no lacing. aroma is faint vanilla like a vanilla coke. taste is light and crisp with distinct sweet vanilla aftertaste. mouthfeel is very light and not chewy as i prefer with a porter. drinks more like a flavored brown ale or vanilla coca-cola. ok but not my style as far as porters go.
6229,Vanilla Porter,3.5,still going through old reviews and posting them here  pours dark with a thin off white head  vanilla nutty and dark aroma  clear and present vanilla some dark nutty chocolatey undertones  light easy carbo and moderate to thin body
6230,Vanilla Porter,3.4,poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint.  look - deep dark amber kind of a root beer color. gorgeous shade. head is fluffy billowing with life a bright cap on the mellow body. a very attractive looking beer could be a hair darker though.  smell - fairly weak. initial note is just metallic but some toasted grains poke through after a bit. no real vanilla or anything though.  taste - vanilla and milk chocolate. doesnt even register as a beer really more of some kind of dessert drink. its not obnoxious or in-your-face though its got a bit of class and sophistication.  feel - a bit too thin-bodied for how i typically enjoy my dark beers. could do with a bit more sparkle and pep as well.  overall - eh its ok. for a random bottle somebody left in my fridge after a party i cant complain. it makes for a decent weekday after-dinner sipper just a nice little tasty treat to finish the day.
6231,Vanilla Porter,3.55,no head thin looking unremarkable brown color fairly thin mouthfeel overtly sweet vanilla smell and taste. like an alcoholic version of a vanilla flavored soft drink.
6232,Vanilla Porter,3.66,clear reddish brown appearance with an average size tan head and light lacing. aroma of toasted nuts vanilla and ripe fruit. vanilla overshadows the nutty slightly smokey character in the taste. sweet malts are close to being cloying. medium bodied moderately carbonated mouthfeel.
6233,Vanilla Porter,3.6,l - copper pour with thin off-tan head. no lacing. s - faint vanilla. t - sweet tasting. f - thin mouthfeel. o - just not much here for me.
6234,Vanilla Porter,3.64,poured from a bottle a thin light cola color. the nose reminds me of a cream soda with the vanilla notes upfront. it’s sweet to the sip with more of that syrupy cola character.
6235,Hop Wallop,4.5,reminded of this beer by the how many beers of fame have you reviewed? post. surprised that i have not reviewed this before have probably had a case of this. miss this beer.
6236,Hop Wallop,3.96,a smooth drinking ipa that pours into a gorgeous golden haze with about a 2 inch white frothy head. the head lingers for a while in the glass which is great. the beer gives off wonderful hoppy.earthy aromas with a tropical twist. the taste follows the nose giving pine and floral like notes but with some tropical fruit notes too. this definitely packs a wallop at 7.5% but does drinks more like a session. could definitely have more than one but i would not advise as the alcohol could sneak up on you. enjoy the drinkability and smoothness of this wonderfully crafted ipa!
6237,Hop Wallop,4.85,i’ve been saving this bottle for a few years only to pull it out after a hop devil. it is still one of my favorites. great flavor color nose and flavor. victory excels again.
6238,Hop Wallop,3.47,appearance: liquid gold. pure clean and translucent. looks like an ale youd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom just dont drink too deeply or too greedily. puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over living on only as a pattern of sticky striated lacing.  bouquet: floral earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant like flowers far away on a mountain. traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that far-off mountain breeze. pleasant but falls profoundly short of being impressive.  feel: a cold babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this light-bodied ale. crisp with a dry tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early.  taste: bright semi-sweet pine quiet notes of pepper and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone.  overall: meh? it’s pleasing refreshing and theres nothing wrong with it but it’s meek and doesnt add anything new to the genre. a serviceable middle-of-the-road ipa thatll never stand out but sometimes thats just what the menu calls for.
6239,Hop Wallop,4.28,pours golden yellow with a 2 inch white head with good retention. heavy lacing to end.  strong aroma of pine grapefruit earthy floral.  taste is resiny pine slight spiciness including pepper.  medium bodied light carbonation. dry bitter finish.  this is a damn good ipa! one of the best.
6240,Hop Wallop,3.83,had this several times before my dad gave me a 6-er about two weeks ago. i have one of these left but here are my thoughts now. poured into a tulip the appearance was a semi-dark yellow branded color with some transparency about it. some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace. lace coats in a semi-dusty way but clingy. the aroma had a strong citrusy pithy/bitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones. malts seem barely there. the flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath. mild pine tree aftertaste fairly dry. the mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue. holding its own as its scraping like what i remember of old school ipas/dipas. sturdy carbonation and good for the style. sure is a sipper. finishes bitter through dry pine tree notes.dry overall not for the faint of heart this is what old school dipas seem to have started out as. this is one i would come back to preferably for me.
6241,Headroom,4.54,canned 8/29/23 and shipped to pa  definitely think it borders on living up to the hype - a very good hazy. super soft and creamy; little grassier than i prefer my ipas but this is balanced enough that its not a detraction nor is it over the top. glad i finally got the tick on this one but there are definitely other trillium hazies i would prefer to this.
6242,Headroom,4.25,overrated. highly disappointed. huge letdown.
6243,Headroom,4.35,grapefruit sunny d. on draft at churchkey.
6244,Headroom,4.6,pours a very hazy fleshy peach color with a fluffy off white head that leaves ringlets of lace as you enjoy the beer. gorgeous hazy.  the nose is dank and packed with sweet peach aromas orange peel some grapefruit and lots of mango and pineapple. this is literally a beer fruit basket of aromas.  the peach flavors lead the taste and are delicious with the orange mango and pineapple flavors following with a bit of green grapes mid palate and a nice creamy oat flavor on the finish. very balanced and oh so delicious.  the mouthfeel is full soft and creamy adding to the drinkability. this is a magnificent representation of the style imho.
6245,Headroom,4.24,on tap: cloudy bruised peach with a typical hazy head that clings to the edges pretty well. nose is melon and unripe tropical fruits midway through without any agitation. giving the beer a swirl ripens the fruits pretty quickly giving a sweeter impression overall (some sniffs expose an overripe burn but it’s not the norm).  when cold the beer opens with an almost tart fruit note which contrasts poorly with the more bitter middle and finish. it doesn’t completely disappear as the beer warms but it does mellow out and blend in better. the sweetness notes in the nose after a swirl pervades the opening through to near the finish reducing the contrast but taking the bitterness i enjoyed in the back end of a colder beer.  this beer went from a disjointed start with highs and lows to a more balanced but also more typical very good hazy.
6246,Headroom,4.53,on tap pours a beautiful hazy glowing orange. smell is an immediate assault of fresh grapefruit followed by layers of berry and a touch of dank. taste follows. feel is smooth and dang near perfect. no booze no burn. outstanding.
6247,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.34,nothing nuanced about this beer including the bottle art that no doubt will appeal to those young at heart. the color is not bad sort of an orangish golden color no real head or lacing. the smell is the weakest thing here not sure what it is. the taste is simply boozy and not a particularly pleasant booziness. maybe a hint of anise. anyway not a repeater
6248,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.44,poured from a bottle. orangish in color with almost no head. smells of dark fruit yeast and alcohol. sting of alcohol old fruit and leather in the flavor. nothing much to be happy about here. take a pass here
6249,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.2,16.9 oz. bottle:  states on label - beligian style and quad bock - whatever that is supposed to mean:  pours hazed to murky orange with a thin wispy head. minimal lacing.  the smell is of overripe fruitiness (tough to pick out any individual fruits - just a fruity character in general). boozed-soaked caramel comes through loud and clear.maybe a subtle hint of cotton candy? (maybe that\s the belgian part?)  the taste is something like sweet fruit punch with caramel. raw alcohol is present in a malt liquor way. harsh.  this is a rough one. doesnt really fit a style - maybe a doppelbock - but close to a malt liquor/euro strong lager hybrid. its cheap and high in abv.
6250,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.04,500ml bottle. poured out a clear golden orange color with a small white head of foam. it smelled of booziness caramel and toffee. so sweet and boozy. so hot.
6251,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.12,pours with virtually no head has an orangish amber color. not the best smelling beer has a malty smell with an odor that is best decribed as over ripened fruit most people would not find this appealing.  but when it comes to taste this seems to be ok for what it is stronger beers like these are hard to find that are smooth or good tasting. now this beer unfortunately is not an exception the taste is something along the line of over ripened apple and there is definitely some alcohol burn with this one not for everyone. also very little carbonation. but definitely a bit better than most beers of this category. this is the type of beer you drink when you want to find your date more attractive. defintately a kicker but worth a try if you like stronger beers was found at not a bad price $2.00 for a pint at tone &country liquor on 47th and richmond chicago
6252,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.26,a gift from john and lorene no date on the bottle but it has a nice label... l: pours a clear reddish orange without any discernible head. s: alcohol......and for lack of a better phrase a rotting taffy apple. t: the 14% abv hits you right upside the head and finishes with an unpleasant rotting fruit taste. o: without a doubt one of the worst beers ive ever head. its so bad that if i had a trip to lithuania a planned id cancel it.
6253,Hell On High Quad Bock,3.6,rinkuškiai hell on high quad bock 16.9 fl. oz brown glass bottle coded l.10443 $2.99 @ roger wilco pennsauken nj  notes via stream of consciousness: against my own better judgement having already had one of the strong beers from rinkuškiai i\m going to go ahead and try hell on high. at least the label is good with a devilish looking character petting a white poodle. so even with a rough pour i was unable to bring up a head. there\s a little bubbly foam here and there but not much. that really hurts it in terms of appearance. the body is a very hazy deep amber with an orange sheen and golden highlights. the aroma is malty and caramelish with a light bit of apple-like fruitiness. the flavor follows and i\m quite surprised it\s much better than i thought it would be. the rich caramel maltiness is pleasant and not overdone and there are no off-flavors. the alcohol does show slightly but i think it\s actually helping to dry it in the finish along with its median bitterness some herbal hops and refreshing apple-like fruitiness. it could be a more carbonated but it\s not bad it works well with the full bodied maltiness. i\m going to guess it\s around 2.0 volumes of co2 where a standard beer is around 2.5 and a cask ale is more like 1.8. i keep smelling it swirling it waiting to find something bad come out as it warms but it hasn\t happened yet. however more and more alcohol is showing but we\ll see if all of that malt keeps it in balance ... ... ... hmm it\s stayed pretty much the same except that it has lost some carbonation which leaves it even softer and that hurts it on mouthfeel despite it\s chewy maltiness. the bottle label did say it was bottle conditioned but i highly doubt that and even if it was it\s hard to coax enough carbonation out at 14% abv. so what to say? it\s perfect for malt heads and those who just love strong beers. for anyone else it\s more like a golden caramel flavored dessert beer and even in that it\s pretty one-sided. i\m surprised it\s as clean as it is and so not-hot with alcohol but that\s not enough to pull it beyond a decent beer despite it\s quad bock status.
6254,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.52,we gotta call it for what it is. this is kind of an over-abv joke label from lithuania. a) flat dark whiskey body no head nothing on top (fail). s) absolutely fine with sweet fruit predominant alcohol laden fruit cake cider b&b. t) the taste follows nose but more complex and nuanced with sweetness whiskey soaked fruit fruit cake tempered by smokey malt and grain backbone again whiskey like. a bit harsh after a few sips. (perhaps a good cooking liquid?) f) sharp cloying not crisp on the thicker side w very low amount of carbonation. o) sub-par overall. too sweet too harsh.
6255,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.78,appearance: cloudy orange color with a few surface bubbles as a head.  smell: over ripe golden apples and alcohol are most notable and unappealing.  taste: grainy malt base with honey over ripe apples pears and lots of warming alcohol.  mouthfeel: heavy in body. smooth from start to finish. long lasting sweet and burning aftertaste.  overall: this beer is way too sweet with a rancid apple flavor with loads of alcohol burn. not for me.
6256,Hell On High Quad Bock,3.17,this unique brew was enjoyed from the bottle in a snifter. pouring a very nice clear and bright amber this beast produces a thin ring and subtle pool with very light lacing. nose of heavy apple cider light brown sugars and strong grain alcohol. flavors follow the nose with brown sugars and golden raisins awash in apple cider and beaten to death by strong warming grain booze. decent mouth feel warming and lightly coating. let it warm and be lightly rewarded yet know that the strength of the grains and booze increase as well beating you over the head with strong booze.  decent but a touch over the top without enough depth.  cheers
6257,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.98,if there was a beer equivalent to getting punched in the head this would be it. it tastes extremely grainy smells as dank as it tastes. that being said i love this ish. for a 14% beer it is still comparatively drinkable.  give this to your buddy if you want to here him talk about his divorce for two hours.
6258,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.94,from the bottle it pours amber with virtually no head. somewhat malty aroma - lots of grain? alcohol and some grainy malt in the mouth. this beer hits you like a freight train!
6259,King JJJuliusss,5,perfect neipa.
6260,King JJJuliusss,4.62,l - opaque light orange with a off-white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing s - orange and mango up front with pineapple and some grapefruit slight notes grassy hops t - tropical forward and throughout - mango and orange dominate intermixed with grassy piney slightly bitter hops along with notes of grapefruit and pineapple - theres some bready malt in there to balance everything out f - full bodied with moderate carbonation. fluffy soft smooth o - a truly great and well balanced neipa
6261,King JJJuliusss,4.82,whats left to say about the best of the best of the neipa style? i dont know but it pours an absolutely gorgeous opaque turbid chewy looking beast. aromas and flavors burst with never-too-bitter juices. ridiculously smooth pillowy mouthfeel and soft easy finish. just incredible.
6262,King JJJuliusss,4.39,poured from a can into a snifter appearance- the beer pours a super hazy orange-juice color with a massive puffy white head. the head has a great level of retention fading slowly over time and leaving spiderweb lacing all over the sides of the glass. smell – the aroma is huge of an orange rind smell mixed with sweet notes of tangerine and orange as well as plenty of herbal hops and a strong showing of pine and earth. mixed with thee smells are some juicy pineapple mango and papaya with some citrus hop smell with a ruby red grapefruit. other citrus notes of lemon and lime as well as some bready malt and light grain are there as well mixing in with some raw hop smells to produce a rather dank and green hoppy smell overall. m taste – the taste begins with a thick bready malt flavor that is composed mostly of a smooth wheat doughy and oaty flavor. there is also a moderately sizable fruit flavor upfront with orange and peach being the strongest but with notes of pear and apple and a hint of lemon in there as well. the hop is strong from the start as well with a earthy and herbal hop being the most pronounced followed by some notes of pine and floral hops. as the taste advances the pine and herb grown stronger while the earth fades bringing more dankness to the tongue. that said the sweetness picks up a tad balancing out the hops rather well and with some very raw hop and grassy flavors coming on at the end one is left with a dank but sweeter and malty taste to linger on the tongue. mouthfeel – the body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate to higher carbonation level. quite nice for the thick and dank tastes of the brew and certainly makes for a nice slow sipper. overall –a quite nice and tasty brew with a lot of hop attitude but a balanced demeaner. while not quite up to the hype it is certainly a well crafted brew.
6263,King JJJuliusss,4.56,appearance: a bubble show lifts the head to a fullsome three fingers perched atop the cloudy goldenstraw colored liquid; strong retention with clumps of lacing left behind  smell: mango mandarin orange and ruby red grapefruit aromatics with hints of passion fruit pineapple and melon  taste: mango pineapple and mandarin orange forward with some melon underneath; the passion fruit and ruby red grapefruit emerge in the middle; the finish is juicy with moderate bitterness and a touch of hop burn in the aftertaste  mouthfeel: medium to full body; creamy with moderate carbonation  overall: a top quality effort from tree house but very similar to countless others i have had from them
6264,King JJJuliusss,4.29,pours a not sure how describe this color its not golden its not yellow its not brown. somewhere between. maybe some orange. off white head. not as pungent aromatically as batch 6000. theres orange grapefruit some textured soapiness. idk this is really good. is it an improvement on regular ass kj? idk. the moniker seems excessive the beer is not.
6265,King JJJuliusss,4.69,very tropical nose. sweet and orange-ish like sunnyd with nice acidity and alcohol to balance. a wow! beer for sure one that sets the bar for how a hazy can taste.
6266,Carib Ginger Shandy,3.01,275 ml bottle from a six-pack purchased at the lcbo; best before aug 2023 and listed at 0.9%. served slightly chilled.  pours crystal clear golden-yellow stirring up a thin layer of bubbly suds that barely qualifies as a head. within thirty seconds it has sizzled away leaving the surface utterly barren - no lace either. the aroma is sweet smelling mainly of candied ginger and sugar; not much going on but its appealing enough.  the flavour profile is similar - theres no depth whatsoever but since its also palatable im not too inclined to complain about a 0.9% shandy lacking complexity. sugary sweet at the forefront with notes of ginger spiciness giving way to a sweeter candied ginger-like flavour on the back end. maybe a hint of caramelized sugars and grainy malts but sugary ginger is the main takeaway; the aftertaste is a little sweet. light in body with crisp prickly carbonation that complements its ginger flavours nicely; its refreshing and effortlessly easy to knock back.  final grade: 3.01 a c+. my most common complaint about ginger beers is that they dont have enough of a bite to them and sadly caribs ginger shandy is no exception. that being said if i were sitting on a caribbean beach in the summer i think id be quite content with this very basic ginger beer. its acceptable and not much more than that - i might buy another six-pack mostly because its nice to have a (functionally) non-alcoholic brew in the back of the fridge for afternoon refreshment... and also because there arent many other real ginger beers to pick from around here.
6267,Carib Ginger Shandy,3.37,(12 oz clear bottle 0.9% alc/vol. code 09 15 am 20024; purchased single off shelf... poured into a fat tulip)  polished-clear gold liquid; foam disappears in seconds... basically candied/crystallized ginger on the nose... just about the same on the palate - candied ginger marginally ginger beer aftertaste; mellow-moderate spicy bitterness however caramel sweetness holds momentarily before fading away so its not too terribly sweetish... somewhat flat in fizz; roundish but short of viscous... flavorful enough but also arguably bland; could use a bit more spicy (acidic) zip to achieve more balance with the dull sweet lull; liquid diluted candy more alco-pop than beer/malt-bev more or less (1711)
6268,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.85,(original review from october 19 2004)  i finally tried the ginger version of this. it has a light tan ginger ale color to it. some foam forms but it fizzes instantly away like soda. the aroma is sugary sweet and gingery with a mouthfeel much like ginger ale. the flavor is sweet and gingery. it isnt as intense as a ginger beer but still has a tiny bit more burn than a ginger ale. the aftertaste has some ginger flavor lingering along with some bready notes (the only beer-llike characteristic i detected. no alcoholic warmth to finish it out.  this is basically alcoholic ginger ale. it was much better than the bright red sorrel version but it is still more alcopop than beer. i could actually imagine drinking this as a refreshing beverage unlike the cloying sorrel version.
6269,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.13,transparent pinkish blonde body with a small broken head. big time ginger aroma. sugary sweet some vanilla notes. lots of ginger. too sweet for me. no way i could drink much of this. headache.
6270,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.63,a: the beer is clear yellow in color. it poured with a short white head that quickly died down and completely faded away. s: moderate aromas of ginger are present in the nose—just like you were sniffing the fresh ginger that you get as an accompaniment to sushi. t: much like smell the taste has lots of moderate flavors of ginger. neither sweetness nor bitterness are perceptible. m: it feels light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. o: this beer tastes like a ginger ale without the sweetness. it is quite flavorful for a shandy.
6271,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.44,330ml single bottle procured at my favorite down-market bottleshop in e-town.  this beer pours a clear pale golden amber colour with one (i think) finger of fizzy soda-pop head which predictably wisps away just as fast as you can look at it leaving nothing resembling lace near the glass.  it smells of sharp edgy and duly spicy ginger root middling caramel notes and a gritty sugarcane sweetness. the taste is much more of the same - rather sweet syrupy sugar tinted with a burnt caramel/toffee essence still perky and peppy natural spicy ginger an echo of actual indistinct malt and a mild herbal astringency very much like those caribbean bitters.  the bubbles are barely adequate more like the kind that remain in a bottle of cola left in the fridge for three days the body a deceptive medium weight as all that extra sugar has to go somewhere. it finishes well sweet in a rather saccharine sense the ginger holding on much as it would in the associated soft drink.  yeah yeah yeah this is sweet like soda low alcohol and yet pretty gingery. this all may be a bit confusing but id take this in a heartbeat over any actual ginger ale as all other things being equal the minor abv and heady ginger root notes make this a winner. a winner for canadian grocery stores that is and not as a lager beer as theyve so brazenly plastered on the label.
6272,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.55,12 oz bottle poured into pint glass  a: pours very very light yellow good finger and a 1/2 of white head that settles to nothing... no lacing at all... looks very flat no carbonation at all.  s: ginger ale a little caramel and lots of sweet sugar. (is this beer ??)  t: just like the smell straight up ginger ale hint of caramel... very sweet... not beer like at all.  m: light bodied no carbonation but leaves a sugary sticky feel in the mouth.  d: lets be honest this is not a beer it is ginger ale with a touch of alcohol... run away.
6273,Finestkind IPA,4.38,poured from 12 oz can into pint glass. thin white head drops quickly mild lacing slightly hazy orange color abundant carbonation. aroma is pine dominate with definite malts as well. mouthfeel is medium. flavors: pine orange peel grapefruit bread dough. the 6.9% is hardly noticeable (i.e. no strong alchohol burn). overall: an american ipa as they once were. good to enjoy an ipa that actually fits the style.
6274,Finestkind IPA,3.92,its good. one of the few old school ipa choices amidst all the hazy juicy brews.
6275,Finestkind IPA,4.24,clear brite yellow with thick head great smell of hops refreshing hop taste in every sip
6276,Finestkind IPA,4.03,light amber with slight chill haze off-white head good retention rings of lace aromas of grapefruit pine and caramel malt citrus pine and caramel malt flavor. slightly sweet nice lingering bitterness medium bodied slightly sticky appropriately carbonated a real throwback. west coast ipa brewed for folks used to the old school east coast ipa.
6277,Finestkind IPA,2.11,meh.
6278,Finestkind IPA,4.19,bronze in color with a slight head that gave way to lacing. nose is piney. taste is slightly smokey with a big bitter smash. could use a little more abv. very well done ipa.
6279,Finestkind IPA,3.76,from a 12oz bottle dated 9/15/22 into a pint glass.  pours a ever-so-slightly hazy yellowish orange with about one finger of white head. meh retention. light lacing.  smell is interesting...light citrus mainly oranges. bready smell as well. maybe mild cornbread.  taste is a nice balance of hops and malts. pine/resin with some bready backbone.  slightly sticky mouthfeel. very easy drinking. light bitter aftertaste. low carbonation.  good old-school ipa that trends on the malty side.
6280,Finestkind IPA,3,pours a clear gold. thin foam. soapy aroma. bitter hop body. a little skunky. not really as good as it should be. pretty one sided.
6281,Finestkind IPA,4.53,its the thing...! bravo!!! beware of the batch: 4/21/2022 4019:21 i had a 12 ounce 6-pack its totally over carbonated; 1/3 of every can is foam whenever you open it. bad luck this time :(
6282,Finestkind IPA,4.04,a long time favorite. ranks behind bells 2 hearted & torpedo. crisp clean balanced. pine. pleasant bitterness. purchased at total milford.
6283,Finestkind IPA,4.22,very nice ipa with a nice maltiness and a nice hops bite without being bitter. i highly advise ipa lovers to check this one out.
6284,Blind Pig,4.03,1 pint 1.25 fl. oz. bottle served in a nonic pint glass  this beer pours a clear golden hue. it is topped with a couple inches of off-white head that leaves rings of lacing as i consume.  mild resin aroma. pine. otherwise it smells clean.  grapefruit and pine flavor. it is mild. slightly bitter finish with a little lingering bitterness.  medium bodied with a pillowy mouthfeel  solid west coast ipa.
6285,Blind Pig,4.25,17.25oz bottled 7-19-23 opened 9-4-23. 2 finger white head with great retention and full lacing as it recedes to a solid cap. golden ipa body with a bit of chill haze. aromas of peach melon some pine and lemon. vibrant and clean. flavors follow very closely to the aroma - lemon peach...a little zestier with some citrus rind bitterness. bright entry medium body and carbonation. solid bitter punch mid-palate and to late in the dry finish. outstanding.
6286,Blind Pig,4.83,peachy hints of malt and bitterness tropical zesty citrus ripe smooth balanced
6287,Blind Pig,4.49,excellent ipa. actually prefer it over pliny the elder as it is smoother. just a very enjoyable ipa and easily one of the best.
6288,Blind Pig,3.68,510 (what?) ml bottled on 032423 and served in a pint glass. pours real pale and real foamy. super straw yellow color. aroma is very fresh but doesnt have a particularly citrusy or piney smell. first sip brings a pure flavor of old school american ipa: assertively bitter but flavorful with pine sap and spicy wood. there is a very little bit of biscuit malt flavor to go along with it too.  its pretty cool how pure and well-executed this is. it deserves to be a classic but not legendary. then again i cant even imagine what it would have been like to drink an ipa in 1994.
6289,Blind Pig,4.31,look - clear and gold in color white soapy head lacing was spotty smell - citrusy piney grapefruit woody aromatic taste - hoppy grapefruit piney spicy fruity feel - medium light body medium carbonation crisp dry with a light bitter finish overall - tasty brew. it was even better as it warmed up a bit. the citrusy and fruity flavors came thru even more. although this brew was a bit light in the body the hoppy grapefruit piney notes added balance and a nice lingering bitterness. i paired her up with pigs (three different ones) by pink floyd for ultimate satisfaction.
6290,Blind Pig,4.02,4/27/23. bottled 3/23/23. sessionable ipa. pine citrus. crisp & clean. good bitterness.
6291,Crazy Stallion,3.44,for the price its a decent beer. i like the size. i am afraid though that as it becomes more popular esp with the homeless the price will go up quick. already raised a quarter.
6292,Crazy Stallion,2.84,this is a review of a 24 oz can. from the bottom of the can: cl01723 1752 fl  appearance: it has a nice warm gold colored body with excellent clarity. it is a beautiful looking beer. it starts out with a short white head but it doesnt last long at all. it quickly drops out to nothing. there is no lacing on the beer other than a few spots of bubbles that are so sparse you could count them individually. aside from the lack of a sustained head or any lacing it is a gorgeous looking beer.  aroma: there is a very very very light hop aroma which smells a bit like noble hops. there is also a very light aroma of what smells like vinyl. its not a very good smelling beer.  taste: there is a light noble hop character up front with a light hint of caramel. towards the middle the flavor increases a bit and there is a touch of walnut with some more herbal notes. although these flavors increase the overall flavor profile is still very mellow and the beer tastes watered down. there isnt any real flavor towards the back of the palate and the aftertaste is just this light walnut flavor.  mouthfeel: it tastes very light and watered down. it is very easy to drink. the can doesnt appear to list any abv but it is important to note that there is no perceived alcohol in either the flavor or the mouthfeel of the beer so it hides the abv very well.  overall: this beer isn\t going to win any prizes for being flavorful or aromatic but it has a nice walnut aftertaste and it is very easy to drink. the label simply calls this a classic lager and it is an easy drinking lager. it has a bit of a vinyl aroma but that was so subtle that it is only noticeable when you are trying to pick out an aroma from the beer; when drinking this normally it doesn\t come through.  normally i wouldn\t mention prices but this one has $1.50 printed on the can itself. it\s not a bad buy if you can get it for that price and just want a cheap and easy drinking lager. i would recommend it to those who are looking for a cheap beer that\s easy to drink. i probably wouldn\t buy this regularly but if i could get it for $1.50 i might buy a few to throw in a cooler with some hotdogs for a cheap camping meal.
6293,Crazy Stallion,3.53,clear medium gold body; very nice carbonation; very little head thin and patchy. weak aroma; faint grain scent. fairly bold grain flavor and sweetness; corn; mild hop bitterness. medium body; smooth with a slight velvet feel and a mild warmth.  not a bad lager for what it is.  poured at 58 °f; the can label lists this is now a classic lager and brewed by hornell brewing co. (part of ferolito vultaggio & sons if i understand things correctly).
6294,Crazy Stallion,3.24,this is an ok beer for $1.25. better than most.
6295,Crazy Stallion,3.43,serve it really cold and pour it into a glass and its not bad at all.
6296,Crazy Stallion,3.32,for a beer thats only $0.70 per 12 ounces is absolutely nothing to complain about. its better than most other cheap beers. it is not going to win any awards you will be pleasantly surprised how it taste for being so cheap.
6297,Crazy Stallion,3.31,this says lager on the 24oz can. for 1.25 for 24 oz i was intrigued. popping the top i get grape juice. pour is classic amber with a weak head. on the taste i get grape juice with angostura bitters. like a weak old fashioned. for $0.05 per oz i am not complaining. not offensive and a great looking can. i think i found a new chugged to hang at the bbq in 95 degrees.
6298,Crazy Stallion,3.66,this isn\t your normal type of beer for 1.25 this is a friendly type of beer. many may say  oh it has a metallic taste but what were they drinking metal? can\t be compared to natty cause it doesn\t taste water downed can\t be compared to let\s say heineken cause it\s a bit malt liqour. this beer can hit the spot when you\re in the dumps. besides this the only other beer that can live up to it is the olde english 800. too bad they don\t make 40 oz of this cause damn that would sure turn the market around. god bless the u.s of a
6299,Crazy Stallion,3.31,was unexpectedly heading to the local commuter train and passed a bodega so i decided to grab a beverage to enjoy on my hour long trip. i spied this wonderful looking 24 oz. can in the cooler and was immediately inspired to take a closer look. hand crafted the label said (btw what do you call the outside of a can? it isn\t technically a label but i digress). american made. original even. and a classic lager. how could it get any better? than in the upper left corner of the aforementioned label was the coup de grace. $1.25! how could it be possible for such a highly touted product to be priced at such an inviting level? and for 1 pt 8 fl oz of anticipated golden nectar. it could only because prime example of american ingenuity at its finest. i had to have it and have it now!  caught my train by the skin of my teeth. found a seat and prepared myself for the journey both in the physical and the emotional. as the train departed the station i cracked open the plebian tab that stood between me and the experience i so longed to have.  how to rate this libation? how to describe it? the question of look remains unexplored. it is truly unfair to fault the beer for this so i fairly (i feel) out this required rating smack dab in the middle of the field. how could one even consider using and vessel but the magnificent aluminum that naturally covers it. luckily the aroma is able to we escape through the approximately inch wide circle created by the escape valve commonly referred to as the tab. i can think of no other words to describe this than sickeningly sweet. this is not a value judgement mind you but a descriptive fact. a negative? who am i to make such a judgement on an esteemed product like crazy stallion.  but we know why you all are here. to discover the taste the flavor how does crazy stallion tickle the tongue. i can only confirm that i absolutely got my $1.25 (actually $1.50 once you calculate the governments share of the experience) of value. and what more can one truly ask for. indeed what more. this crazy stallion was possibly one of the finest travelling companions i have ever had on a commuter rail journey.
6300,Crazy Stallion,1.25,i picked up a 24oz tallboy at my local bodega for $1.25. i drank about half and poured the rest out. has a awful sour metallic taste like it’s been sitting in the can for years. i won’t buy it again.
6301,Crazy Stallion,2.95,$1.25 for a 24 oz beer cant beat that these days. i was pretty surprised how good this beer was. tasted pretty good and if its 5.9% abv then that is amazing. doesnt really taste like its 5.9% seems about maybe 5% or somewhere between 4% to 5% abv but it says 5.9% on here so i guess thats what it is.  i was thinking this was gonna be more crazy than it was you know since it says crazy stallion i was thinking it would be some pretty good stuff like natty daddy but was quite mild for the name crazy stallion. should probably just be called grazing stallion or something like that.  taste reminds me of those cheap no brand beers they sell at some places that are about 4% to 5% abv. taste reminds me of that cheap beer they sell at walgreens you get the 6 pack for like 3 or 4 dollars or something.  the taste is pretty good for the price kind of a low carbonated flavor beer pretty decent. the main thing is the type of buzz you get really which seemed to be like a sleepy beer. had to take a nap felt drowsy after drinking this. not really a stimulating beer. but probably gonna definitely give it some more tries to see what its like some more. maybe i may try this beer again but seems like that beer they sell at walgreens and has the same drowsy effect.  this crazy stallion is like the arizona ice tea of beers pretty much cheap and its just beer.
6302,Crazy Stallion,3.09,pours a clear golden/amber with a ton of head. smell is hard to peg. sort of a metallic malt. taste is not as horrible as expected. malty of course and mildly sweet. not to boozy. drink to get hammered not to have flavor. extra credit for cool ass can.
6303,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,1.9,pours a pinkish orange no head formation. not much in the way of aroma surprisingly with only a slight whiff of peach jolly rancher. taste is rather more booze forward than other ritas - the peach just wasnt reaching me but the underlying sweetness was there. finishes rather harsh as well with a moderate amount of rubbing alcohol.
6304,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,3,bud light lime peach-a-rita brewed by anheuser-busch with an abv of 8.00% this american malt liquor pours out a pinkish/ reddish color with a thin head. this brew pours out of a 25oz can into a pint beer glass. there is a small pink head to this brew but it goes away fast. the smell is sweet with peaches mixed with alcohol. you pick up on little to none on other beer notes in this brew. now for the taste it is really really sweet. lots of peach notes mixed with mirror grains and malts. it is really hard to pick up on the 8.00% abv in this brew it goes down nice an smooth. if you are looking for a fruity flavored brew  you should look this one up. the body of bud light lime peach-a-rita is a solid medium. there is nothing overpowering about this brew if you like sweet peach flavored drinks. this brew would go nice on a warm day or at a party. the mouth feel is bold sweet tart smooth and refreshing. overall i am going to give bud light lime peach-a-rita a solid 3 out of 5. one of more drinkable a-ritas on the market. i would look this brew up again giving the opportunity to just to change it up from other run if the mill brews on the market. anheuser-busch did a nice job with this sweet brew.
6305,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,2.58,a: the beer is hazy peachy pink in color. it poured with a thin collar of white bubbles around the edge of the glass that rapidly dissipated completely fading away. s: moderate aromas of fruit punch are present in the nose along with hints of peach. t: the taste follows the smell and resembles a hybrid of fruit punch mixed with artificial peach flavors with a heavy dose of added sugary sweetness. the peach m: it feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. o: this beer hides its alcohol very well but is very sweet and seems to have lots of artificial flavors and colorings.  serving type: can
6306,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,1.5,bought a single 25 ounce can to try for $2.99 last week while at hy-vee across the river in council bluffs iowa. poured a light pinkish-orange in color with no head to speak of. aroma wasnt really all that good. the taste is well...umm... horrible! poured it right down the drain along with the rest in the can. no bueno!
6307,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,2.24,poured from the can into a budweiser pilsner glass.  quick soda pop fizz is made making a faint non retention head that dissolves in seconds without a collar. fairly quiet on carbonation noise when settled and presents a wild body appearance. the color is a perfect example on the can a peach orange color and a pretty good one its almost neon like in its appearance.  aroma is straight up del monte from a can. fruit cocktail and syrup with quite a bit of sweetness. that seems to be the angle but its not really that enjoyable however a touch of rock salinity makes it a little interesting but the aroma is a just bit too sweet.  palate is pretty much like just any other malt-ternative beverage. sweet sickly alcohol and sticky peach syrup mid flavor palate. lots of simple sugar like syrup and not much else. even the salt character isnt coming out as much that was anticipated. while luckily not too booze tasting it does hit in the gut. afterwards there is too much hubba bubba bubblegum sweetness and flavor which doesnt even make the beer taste like fruit let alone peaches.  it is interesting to compare this to its lime brother. that one seemed to have an angle but this is just straight up booze sugar water.
6308,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,1.74,welcome to my secand as a part of happy new is this beer? sunday (week 650). i had purchased this big boy a while back but when i initially went to review it an approved pic did not exist. that is a no-no for the canquest (tm) so i took the pic resized it submitted it & summarily put the can in the queue awaiting the appropriate moment like today.  from the can: malt beverage with natural flavors and artificial color.  this came in one of those mighty 25-fl. oz. tallboy cans which are unique in that they seem to fight me on the crack! upon accanplishing this feat of strength that it took to open the dang thing the resulting noise was like a sonic boom. an inverted glug was out of the question since a crane was required to lever the cylinder upwards & tilt it into a pouring position. this action produced a brief fizzy finger of off-white head that quickly reduced itself to wisps. color was a cloudy peachy-orangish shade (srm = n/a). the lack of clarity was surprising imho. nose had an odd mustiness to accanpony the peachy sweetness. hmm. mouthfeel was thin & watery & not even all that well carbonated. the taste was really sweet very artificial kind of medicinal & while evocative of peaches in some small way i am not sure that i would have hit upon it without a hint of some stripe. phew. plus it had a fusel alcohol burn that was not helping its cause in any way. i was not really digging what this one had to offer. it felt like liquid headache for later. the unabating sugary sweetness was just not my bag. previous reviewers mentioned gummi bears while another cantradicted this by saying that it did not even taste like peach candy. i cannot remember what peach candy tastes like but i hope that it does not = this. phew. did minhas relocate to stl mo? is a cyberinvasion imminent? finish was hot & dry initially but once the sugary wave took hold it had a lasting sweetness that was unabating. oh man. this is beer? oof.
6309,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,3.64,25 fl. oz. can served in a becker glass  this beverage pours an orangish peach color and is cloudy. if it had a head i missed it. it disappeared quickly leaving no lacing.  the smell is peach lime and salt.  i have to admit it tastes like a peach margarita. it has the peach and lime aspects at least. ill admit that i am not a mixed drink person.  thin mouthfeel and effervescent  it hits the spot on a muggy summer night and the convenience store is your only option.
6310,Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,2.38,a little bit better then the others ones not a big chemical taste. but i could be a little bias because i likr anything peach flavored hahaha cheers.
6311,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.41,22 oz bomber (2015)  a- pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. minimal lacing throughout.  s- dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. there is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. i take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can i start picking up some stale oxidation characteristics. it is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact.  t- following closely from the nose the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first with the vanilla providing ample support. as the beer warms to room temperature the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. no perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. its quite possible this aspect has faded over time. i do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but im just not able to easily pick them out. the only slight knock i can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal.  m - slightly oily with a medium body. carbonation (medium) has held up quite well.  o - for whatever reason i had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. however it has held up remarkably well in that time. i regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. on its own its a delicious beer.
6312,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.64,i received a can from @fbarber in a bif. canned on 1/29/2020. poured into a snulip glass. i took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. it pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. the medium mocha head dissipated very quickly a sign of the alcohol content. lots of raisin on the nose along with roasted malt chocolate a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee and earthy charred nuts. you can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. this is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. it opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over as well. there are also notes of caramel and earthy char and the caliente pepper adds heat. the bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. as the glass warms i think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. the feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and theres no avoiding the 14% abv. the 12 oz. format is appropriate. overall this is a superb example of ris - my favorite style and it richly deserves its world-class rating. i really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit.
6313,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.13,2015 bottle
6314,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.1,poured from a 12oz brown bottle – neck has code 25418 – label notched 2018  bourbon barrel barleywine ale – brewers reserve body is a hazy dark brown almost amber in color. a ½ finger kaki head was produced. the head quickly reduced to a collar of foam leaving only spotty lacing. the nose is of sweet caramel brown sugar and bourbon. the taste has flavors of caramel dark fruit and brown sugar followed by bourbon then a hoppy light bitter lingering finish. the mouthfeel is a little sticky with a full body and a moderate amount of carbonation. overall this is a flavorful barleywine with its drinkability only limited by its high abv. the ale makes for a nice nightcap on a cold winter’s day.
6315,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.45,2015 bottle consumed 8/24/21  this is getting up there in age. i always wish i would have tasted one of these aged bottles versus fresh to see whats changed but i only have the old one. at any rate this is an amazing beer. so smooth and complex on the nose and pallet. its all caramely goodness with tons of booze. but its so smooth. as usual with these brewers reserve they could be thicker for me in appearance and while drinking. its not a huge distraction though. a world class beer but not on the level of the very very best barleywines for me. there might not be anything better though for the price.
6316,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4,12oz beer review from notes:  a big beautiful overly hopped aromatic beast of a beer. tastes like an old leather shoe filled to the tongue with hops malt rye booze tobacco and leather (more or less in that order).  a+
6317,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.01,16oz can at share. amber pour cloudy thin beige head. malty aroma as expected caramel toffee and plenty of bourbon barrel. rich malty taste woody tobacco and more bourbon and its prerequisite heat. smooth and strong.
6318,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.34,2017 vintage aged for 3 years. super mellow and balanced with just about enough bourbon to add to the complexity of the profile. a very nice barleywine.
6319,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.24,pours a dark burgundy-brown with a finger of khaki foam. head retention is good. aroma is toffee raisins molasses and caramel with toasty caramely earthy malts behind. bourbon adds a little swell of heat but its not much. char cuts the bravado from the initial sweetness shifting the end of the nose to a rather sharp cutoff. flavor profile is molasses fig toffee and chocolate all dipped into sweet caramel. toasty nutty and caramely malts add base while bourbon adds a little tangy heat and substance to the sweetness. mouth feel is medium-thick with a firm effervescence. overall sugary and sweet - sure - but bourbon swoops in to add a drop of heat and enough dryness to soak it all up. dynamic and flavorful.  served in a 15.5oz speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle. vintage 2018 consumed & reviewed in 2020.
6320,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.12,central waters brewing co. brewer\s reserve bourbon barrel barleywine ale 12 fluid oz brown glass bottle from 2019 $4.79 @ shop rite wine & spirits cherry hill nj  notes via stream of consciousness: its poured a very hazy deep chestnut colored brown body beneath a short head of khaki colored foam. the aroma is quite rich with malt and oak. its woody and toasty with some bourbon and butter cookie notes over medium-dark caramel and crusty bread thats topped with warm nuts and drizzled with molasses. (that actually took me some time to put together so its not exactly stream of consciousness.) wow what a great aroma... lets see how it tastes... well theres some alcohol to it thats for sure and its not as rich as the aroma suggests. the alcohol cuts through the malt straight away and follows through to a dry semi-hot finish that leaves some bitterness lingering. so how strong is this? im not finding anything listed on the label. ahh their website says 13.8% and i can believe that. its a bit much i think. back to the taste theres some raisin brown sugar and coconut in there as well. i appreciate that this is not too sweet but at the same time i find it a little too dry with bitterness (80 ibus) and alcohol ~ mainly the alcohol. in the mouth its medium-full and moderately zesty. the head didnt hold up very well and as you might have expected given that the lacing was limited. overall i think its a decent enough after-dinner sipper but its not the best that it could be. review # 6992
6321,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.12,im probably ranking this too low for the style but a bit too much for me. choosing to sit down with this is akin to skipping another cocktail rather than a beer. boozy thickness throughout warms the chest. just a bit to syrupy for me.
6322,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.24,cws barleywine pours a slightly muddled brown tinted by caramel and fiery orange highlights. a thin khaki foam develops then descends into a creamy looking hairline hugging the perimeter of the glass. a film swirls in the center.  bold aroma dominated by burnt brown sugar with molasses folded gently in. a splash of vanilla and pre-baked cinnamon rolls are finished off with damp oak.  sweet caramel drizzled figs are quickly displaced by bitter dried orange peel. the oak and bourbon are intense and the alcohol flavor lasts the entirety between sips. mulling spices come in and out but develop as it warms.  pretty rich silky feel which ends up being an afterthought to the boozy warmth. the sugary sap coats the lips while a burn and bitter bite fill the chest and mouth.  this is a sipper with an enormous alcohol presence. delicious throughout and a real treat. central waters delivers another beauty from the brewers reserve series.
6323,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,3.94,shared 2019 bottle. pours with a clear mahogany body with a bubbly but relatively durable off white head. very woody with plenty of bourbon. overall: exceptionally woody; would likely benefit from some aging.
6324,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.43,pours a nut brown colored beer with a smaller mohagony colored head.  on the aromas old spicy oak is very well pronounced blending together with sweet toffee and lighter molasses. this got a glazed caramel sweetness atop balanced by matured hops and anise.  has a fuller body with a velvet mouthfeel finding almost no need for any carbonation at all. this is a beer best enjoyed in a slow pace.  tastes of a pungent barrel integration from the get-go accompanied by bakers chocolate and subtle earth feathering the uprising barrel heat perfectly. turns sweeter and hotter then with toffee licorice and caramel malts getting entangled into burned coconut bitter matured hops and warming biting oak. finishes with a mellow relief more toffee bakers chocolate and maintaining bourbon lending a long lasting dry aftertaste to the flavors balancing the sweetness in this very well.  this aged tremendously well providing an awesome balance and depth making this a perfect winter sipper.
6325,Notorious Triple IPA,3.77,draught medium orange with amber highlights for the look. solid amount of toasted grain caramel malt tangerine peel for the aroma. lots of tangerine peel caramel malt flavors. the extra malt tames the hop bite as usual.
6326,Notorious Triple IPA,4.16,hoppy and piney with bitter grapefruit that counterbalances the alcohol sweetness from the tripe ipa makes it surprisingly drinkable for 12% abv.
6327,Notorious Triple IPA,4.4,poured into a seattle beer week pint glass. pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. aroma of caramel malt citrus and piney hops orange mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. flavor is lightly caramel malt citrus and piney hops tangerine grapefruit pineapple mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. so great to find an traditional triple ipa with real malt flavor lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. i was struck but the mild sweetness of this one but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. some hotness but plenty of flavor to cover the abv well. boneyard has always pleased with ipas and im not sure why ive never seen this one in my area before. ill be looking for it in the future. excellent.
6328,Notorious Triple IPA,4.46,look: nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes leaving great lacing behind aroma: i could smell it before i got close to the glass. sweet orange peach strawberries pine sap cantaloupe a little cannabis rich honey-like sweetness ruby-red grapefruit hawaiian bread tangerine and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft taste: whoa. a huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat mouthfeel: full slick slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat overall: this is a big-time beer and a good one at that. this was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when i saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge triple ipa and it shows. tons of hops tons of malt sweetness boozy and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. a well done and tasty iiipa. recommended.
6329,Notorious Triple IPA,4.35,growler filled 10 days ago in portland and arrived in ma. not filled super high on the neck but carb was super solid. really great old money beer. super solid tipa from back in the day. no haze at all super clear. super tasty. seek it out!
6330,Notorious Triple IPA,4.38,on tap at edison city ale house.
6331,Notorious Triple IPA,4.11,wow. usually double ipas are too strong for me. this is a triple ipa. and yet it is delicious! it is incredibly strong but you have to expect that. its like drinking port if port was really really good and tasted like an excellent ipa.
6332,Clover,4.26,375ml waxed and capped bottle into torst stemware.  pours a bright goldenrod color. 0.5 finger foamy white head. little lace with thin legs. nose is juicy pear lemon zest peppercorn and a spritz and funky barnyard. moderately aromatic. beer opens lemon zest apricot pit with a slight touch of butter in the back. funky towards the middle. hints of bread yeast and peppercorn. tart lemon seed in the finish. lightly puckering aftertaste. body is light with ample carbonation. prickly and lively on the palate and goes down zesty dry with a long lingering aftertaste.  great complexity though i wish id continued to wait a bit before opening this.
6333,Clover,4.96,batch 3 bottle poured onsite at hill farmstead brewery in greensboro bend vt.  this one pours a clear golden yellow-ish orange with a small head and lots of lacing.  this smells like a sort of rustic oak thing lemon peel stone fruit white wine candied orange and a dry hay like quality.  this is a blend of flora art and ann so it’s not surprising at all that this is really good. having had all of those at this point i wouldn’t say any one beer entirely stands out – this becomes its own thing that stands completely on its own and might be better than each of the three titans that contributed. it’s very oaky and orange-like with a hay-like dry finish that is just so refreshing. there’s also stone fruit white wine dried lemon peel with a restrained and very pleasant acidity.  this is light bodied clean lightly and pleasantly tart and super drinkable.  this is absolutely fantastic and might just crack the top 5 of hill farmstead beers that i’ve had – it’s just such a good and clearly deliberate blend.
6334,Clover,4.7,bottle. 2020 edition. at hf brewery.  white head with some lace. clear golden color.  such an excellent saison. definitely has flavors of the base beers. elegant is a great word for this beer. drinks like a white wine maybe a chardonnay. white grapes oak green apples faint saison spice wheat. dry and bubbly. smooth light easy drinking. faint tartness nice citrus.
6335,Clover,4.79,had at a mortalis share. definitely one of those taste the country yellow beers. tart crisp light. not my style but come on now…these bottles shares are amazeballs. lots of oak dryness.
6336,Clover,4.71,had b2 and b3 side by side. this rating is for b2 which was better in just about every category than b3. b3 wasnt bad by any means but b2 was an amazing farmhouse ale /saison
6337,Clover,4.74,clear yellow-gold with minimal head formation dying to a clear bubbly and uneven surface that disperses to a bubbly flat collar. the appearance was impressively identical between two different batches which we were fortunate enough to enjoy in one evening.  starting with batch 2 the oak is very expressive yet gentle at the same time backed by reduced citrus juice characteristics like grapefruit orange and lemon. this was a smaller pour than i had of batch 3 but the contrasts were stark while the more obscure parallels somehow held firm.  out of batch 3 i perceive a larger presence of straw and young oak up front but this quickly gives way to more acid than b2 while yet remaining palatably balanced. this acidity expresses like yellow raspberry and seedy passion fruit countered by a frothy body that exhales refined oak threads. while that ann oak in conjunction with the subtle funk of art solidly affirm their support it was clear that floras return to the blend saw her influence well exerted here.  this has been a very long time coming for me and contrary to most experiences with meeting your idols this did not let me down. i came away preferring b3 though absent of overwhelming confidence as they were both phenomenal in different ways.
6338,Clover,4.48,bottle conditioning since december 23 2020. so i believe batch 3.  lemon & lime with soft oak & light earth. vinous white wine notes. lower carbonation.
6339,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.98,355 ml can. part of sleemans mixed 6. served cold into a pint glass.  appearance - pale golden straw colored beer. good expressive carbonation and a finger plus of head that has some staying power.  smell - quite a bit of grainy notes and some cooked veggies. not unpleasant and more aromatic than expected but doesnt inspire confidence either.  taste - strangely flavored nothing off but theres not really any grain. very watery. not unpleasant but not great either.  mouthfeel - clean and somewhat crisp carbonation is pretty intense yet theres a sensation of this going down so so easily.  overall - better than i thought itd be but not great gassy but goes down surprisingly easy.
6340,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,3.5,medium: capped pils glass. opacity: bright with a faint mist of minerals. color: almost golden with low activity. head: slightly foamy 1-2 finger. legs: decent okay swirl reaction. smell: cabbage/minerals. taste: barley/floral. feel: cereal/noble hops. body: medium slick. carbonation: prickly. overall: feels like a german pils does the job well not much adjuncts. pretty good quality probably the best one they brew.  visual 6/10 - flavors 6/10 - sensations 6/10 - balance 7/10 - freshness 8/10 - intensity 5/10 - complexity 6/10 - appreciation 6.5/10
6341,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.48,regardless of the name on the label virtually all of sleemans core brands look the same. silver creek lager is no different: light yellow in colour with an antiseptically clean complexion and bubbles so plentiful yet entirely ineffective that they must be artificial (they cant sustain a proper head).  theres a certain characteristic that from day one ive noted in all sleeman products; its especially prominent in the aroma. its been many years since ive last had an offering of theirs but i still feel confident i could pick them out in a lineup with other mass-produced domestic brand lagers.  now i realize it must be the brand of corn syrup they use. this sweet stenchy skunky note has an industrial ring to it a synthetic flavour that is markedly different from the wholesome toasty graininess of actual malted barley. this taste is more like canned corn kernels and is unpleasant even off-putting.  the one thing i hear in defense of large commercial breweries is that theyre consistent; like mcdonalds their beer taste the same everywhere. you always know what youre getting. to replicate a fermented product like beer to the same standards time and time again on a massive scale isnt easy. this is true.  but who wants to make shitty beer? and who wants to drink shitty beer? i tasted my first silver creek lager over a decade ago and it was just as insipid then as it is now. thats an impressive feat but not one i think worthy of commending. consistency is a good attribute - quality is a better one.  the folks at sleeman arent dummies. theyve left this recipe the same for good reason: it sells. this lager may be an injustice to the czech and german ones that originally inspired it but sorry to say its bland sweet light-bodied and firmly carbonated qualities are exactly what most consumers look for.
6342,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.68,a: golden light active carbonation. white head. s: apple skunk corn. mild. t: apple mild bread corny. mild sweetness pleasant bitterness. f: crisp and bright but just slightly over carbonated. o: inoffensive but unremarkable. i wouldnt avoid it but i wouldnt seek it out either.
6343,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.56,a - pale straw colour. good deal of carbonation. head fades quickly with no real lacing.  s - a slight skunky smell at the beginning with an apple scent as well. almost has a cider-like sweet smell but not in an appealing sense when im about to drink a lager.  t - more of the apple like smell but the taste is fortunately not as sweet. slightly bitter aftertaste though no real hop presence. a bit of a musty taste at the very end as well.  f - carbonation is appropriate for the style. fairly crisp and refreshing.  o - overall slightly unimpressed with this one not that i had overly high expectations. i think i can say this is my least favourite sleeman product and im not typically a big fan of the company either. i havent had the light or the original draught in a while but from what i remember i enjoyed them both slightly more. however it is still a serviceable lager that could be consumed in large amounts and the unappealing factors would likely diminish after the first 2 or 3.
6344,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.5,flashback #309
6345,Ganache,3.97,2018 vintage  l: pours almost pitch black. not much of a head just a thin collar of bubbles.  s: vinegar up front with dark fruit and a touch of raspberry  t: tart raspberry up front. on the back end it fades to roasted malts and just a hint of roasted cocoa. oud bruin-like.  f: medium bodied with a bit of a dry finish. this one is a sipper.  o: comparing this beer to cake is a stretch since sourness dominates. an interesting and complex beer.
6346,Ganache,4.24,2018 vintage. pours from the bottle near black with a ruby fringe brief fizzy that dissipates to the faintest ring of carbonation no lacing. nose is very fruit forward with deep rich raspberries raspberry jam sweet balsamic vinegar; lots of brett as well but the fruit is most prominent. taste plays out much the same with tart raspberries and slight funkiness overwhelming at the outset. only on the finish are there significant malt notes which are subdued a slightly chalky though this could be due to the age. mouthfeel is coating and the carbonation effervescent and the alcohol is very well hidden. very enjoyable and drinkable.
6347,Ganache,4.16,a: opaque; cola brown in color; virtually no head - a tan skim cap that receded quickly to a thin collar; no lacing;  s: combination of vinegar dark fruit and raspberry;  t: raspberry and vinegar - the balance between the two goes back and forth;  m: light to medium bodied; moderate to high carbonation; moderately dry finish;  o: really nice flavor;
6348,Ganache,3.63,split with rudzud july 2018 vintage but literally bought this at the brewery a few weeks ago pours a darker foamy bubbly head with lower retention fair lacing messy lacing and decent legs very dark black beer  nose brings big brett funk farmhouse funk and tart slight sourness fair juicy raspberry little chocolate raspberry touch of plastic clash of roast funk and plastic  taste brings tart fruit up front a little sour raspberry a little chocolate and some bitter roast raspberry jam light tart funky brett light funky brett farmhouse some acidity finishes a bit slimy little bitter more funk and sour dark malt clash  mouth is med bod a little slimy like feel somehow light acidity medium-high carb little astringent  overall not that good raspberry flavor is nice but the sour stout is not and the funk is meh this just missed quite a bit
6349,Ganache,3.63,split with jlindros. 2018 vintage  a - poured into a kate the great tulip a nice almost dark black hue with a thin wispy off white ran head that fades to leave light wisps and a thin halo.  s - aromas of dark chocolate belgian candy sugars flashes of raspberry tart. light funk really mostly tart with dark sugars.  t - taste is similar to the nose with big fruity red raspberries bright and tart. the chocolate is light and decent loads of belgian sugars finish is chalky and a bit astringent.  m - mouthfeel is lightly carbonated very flemmy little sharp.  o - overall this was a rather underwhelming beer. flemmy too much roast and sugars. the raspberry flavour is the only redeeming quality of this one.  serving type: bottle
6350,Ganache,4.06,very dark red almost appearing black but up to a light it still has ruby edges. this is topped by a foamy tan head settling to a persistently thick and creamy blanket leaving ridges and a couple of curled arms of lacing.  taste is toasty seeds and malt but not roasty with a tart mild raspberry-cherry presence through a frothy soft body that finishes tingly dry. its a little wild herbal and woody with some char but not too much.
6351,Ganache,4.25,l: poured from a bottle to a goblet. had a dark brown color and a thick opaque consistency. there was a half inch of foamy off white somewhat long-lasting head. not much lacing to speak of.  s: a very nice aroma of chocolate belgian yeast berries coffee and some caramel.  t: tasted of a tinge of coffee (very fleeting) a fair amount of belgian-style yeast (present throughout) a lot of dark chocolate (quite rich) cherries a hint of caramel and lots of raspberries. this is a complex subtle and likable flavor. it doesnt overpower your palate but it has a nice forcefulness to it. tasty stuff.  f: a well-carbonated beer with a sharp finish. medium-bodied.  o: a thoroughly enjoyable beer. drinkable.
6352,Xocoveza,4.37,have had before (and certainly had fresher as this bottle had a best before date of july 17 - 2018 (this is on me - in my cellar at 60 degrees f). it pours a really nice dense black with scant tan head - again 5 years old...so my fault on the head. amazing nose with chocolate cinnamon spice and vanilla - perhaps a hint of roasty coffee - but the spice notes are just right. taste is smooth with chocolate note vanilla sweetness and cinnamon spice yet maintains a bit of a roast coffee note also with a hint of bitterness. despite the limited head this maintains a brisk carbonation and a beautifully silky creamy mouthfeel. hopefully stone (sapporo) sends some fresh stuff north to canada as pretty sure this 5 year old bottle was the last time sold here....
6353,Xocoveza,5,this is my first sample. im wary of stouts made with lactose because while i have had a couple of good ones -- espressway and two die 4 by two roads -- ive had sickeningly sweet examples such as gunners daughter from mast landing and brig from springdale.  in any event this particular brew is black in color. it boasts a thick lasting tan head. the nose is muted initially; it is faintly redolent of sweetness cream and spice.  it is creamy and medium-bodied in feel.  the palate stuns me. beautiful flavors of dark chocolate and coffee meld flawlessly with a variety of spices. the spice component is perfect; it is not overdone.  the beers high abv is utterly hidden.  i have nothing but praise for this stout. it is the best beer from stone ive ever had. it is perfect.
6354,Xocoveza,4.25,12/25/21 shared bottle @ brian’s.
6355,Xocoveza,4.23,ive had this fresh and cellared.  jet black body with a dark khaki head. picking up cinnamon coffee and dark chocolate. taste fresh has chocolate cinnamon slight chili pepper and warm spices. taste with a couple of years changed a little more of a roasted coffee and chocolate and little to no chili peppers but the cinnamon and cardamom spices are a little more prevalent. mouthfeel fresh and aged is full and satisfying. a decent lingering chocolate spice cake on the tongue. a really tasty beer fresh or with a little age on it. actually i prefer it with a couple of years.
6356,Xocoveza,4.25,on tap at cardinal pub bar stavanger: black colour tan head. aroma and flavour of roast malts coffee cinnamon nutmeg lactose chili peppers. very good and unusual beer.
6357,Xocoveza,4.33,look: 95% black  smell: light chocolate coffee  taste: roasted malt the chocolate flavor is actually not that strong and i can barely taste the pepper or cinnamon  feel: creamy and smooth maybe a little too bitter tho  overall: this is far away from treehouse milk stouts its overrated in my opinion
6358,Xocoveza,4.25,robust dark and bold with fine lacing. distinct hints of cinnamon peppers spices and chocolate in both the nose and palate. it all finishes strongly and slowly.
6359,Xocoveza,3.75,cinnamon upfront followed by some spice from the peppers with a coffee finish. the more you drink the better it gets.
6360,Raging Bitch,2.67,would not buy it again. stringent lingering aftertaste that takes all of the fun out. belgian ? yes. ipa ? if so i dont know where...?? this beer has no resemblance to a typical ipa. think belgian with a ferocious bitter and affronting aftertaste. glta. i wont go back to this one.
6361,Raging Bitch,4,good pre-season football beer
6362,Raging Bitch,3.76,look: it pours amber with a bit of cloudiness. it has an off white head with excellent head retention.  smell: it has a strong aroma of apricots with caramel with some honey and citrus.  taste: it has apricot flavor with caramel and honey. there are some light cherry elements with other citrus notes in the background. there are very light barnyard elements.  feel: it has a medium full body with moderate bitterness.  overall it drinks more link a thick west coast ipa than a belgian to me but there are nice worthwhile flavors.
6363,Raging Bitch,3.5,for optimal freshness enjoy by 9/14/22; drank 7/2/22 @ the yarchives.  see-through golden appearance.  a rough pour yielded a big khaki head; strong frothy tree-rung lace.  fresh soap mild corn & faint dry wheat notes in the nose.  sticky medium mouthfeel.  fresh soap & mild orange peel flavors up front; dry clove notes and some booze heat on the finish.  a bit off-putting; not so much a melding of styles as a clashing of styles. abrasive.
6364,Raging Bitch,4.25,poured on tap at dca airport in dc. the beer is a clear dark orange color with a frothy off-white head. strong belgian yeast aroma with brown sugar and balancing malt. taste is balanced with a slight bitter kick at the end. like a belgian funnel throughout lots of brown sugar caramel banana bread spice. finishes with a surprising pine not which brings it back to the ipa aspect of things. a really fun take on a belgian brew with a lot of similarities but also some surprises. recommended.
6365,Matilda,4.21,the pour is golden yellow with some sediment. the taste is belgian yeast mild hops along with some sour notes from brettanomyces along with some mild banana pear & green apple notes. this was quite an impressive belgian ale. cheers! a-
6366,Matilda,4.01,had this beer back in 2007 at 11 % seemed on the strong side . this i i just had at 7% is quite smooth great belgium ale
6367,Matilda,4.12,i love this style. it has quite a bit of fruitiness and funk much like a good apple cider fermented with wild yeast. it reminds me of summer evenings in the countryside... good memories great aroma and flavor.
6368,Matilda,4.08,12 oz bottle date code is unclear but i think its best by 13 jan 26  pours golden orange color white head. aroma of fruity apricot spicy clove bready malt. similar taste a little tart in the finish. thin to medium bodied feel is a little slick.
6369,Matilda,4.26,big blossoming strong ale with brett illuminating notes and rudy-copper body. the alcohol is tame on the palate with a protracted sizzle of carbonation and back to forward bloom of malt sweetness. a jolly good pale ale hybrid.
6370,Matilda,3.79,its been about 5 years since i had this beer at a local event (held at the football stadium in a large party room. this is not a style i generally pursue but i found this beer to be tasty and the flavor grew on me as i consumed it. i didnt take a lot of notes on untappd but i found the bottle to be somewhat spicey and unique.
6371,Apex,3.37,august 16th 2016 - bear republics apex predator is a trip to glacier national park in the glass. it panders to the bear theme but also offers some good citrus pine notes plus the decidedly not park-like pineapple note. i also get tastes of raw tomato and watermelon. the flavor is milder and tickler than the aroma implies with a stickiness some dank touches ginger and orange candies. its a little too sweet for me but not far from where id like it to be.
6372,Apex,3.53,from a 22 oz. bottle with no date or code. l. dark-orange and hazy with a mammoth off-white head which reduces to a bubbly cap in minutes. s. oranges and pineapple honey and bread apricot nectarine a bit dank not bitter. t. it tastes like its past its prime but it aint bad. caramel honey woody bitterness some grapefruit over-ripeness. f. full body a bit less than average carbonation somewhat resinous finish. o. the hop forward flavors and bitterness are barely a shadow of what they probably once were. still an ok beer. cheers!
6373,Juice Machine,3.61,i expected a lot out of this one due to the near legendary status afforded it. it was unfortunately just ok.  this one pours a hazy golden yellow color with a small head and lots of lacing.  this has kind of a dry sharpness to it – with a muddled hop character that just doesn’t pop anywhere as vibrantly as you’d expect from tree house. there’s an odd little vegetal sweetness too.  this is slightly creamy but not as drinkable as you’d want.  i have absolutely adored tree house lately but this was a bit of a misstep. it wasn’t horrible by any means but very forgettable.
6374,Juice Machine,4.68,always feels good to un-tick that wants box. no idea how it took so long to get around to this one but i\m enjoying it more than i even thought i would based on the th description. one again just another near-ideal version of the neipa style with such balance and smoothness it shouldn\t be possible. crazy.
6375,Juice Machine,4,2023-05-26 16oz can served in a gobletty-tulip glass. can is dated 03/02/23. got it from @sulldaddy in nbs bif #17.  pours murky yellowish amber small creamy head. smell is juicy ripe tropical stuff -- pineapple maybe mango. smell rich. taste is a bit of a departure from the smell -- juiciness is still there but dominated by pithy bitterness. strong bitter aftertaste.  mouthfeel is smooth surprisingly clean -- i expected something chewy and thick. little bit of a chalkiness. overall really nice beer.
6376,Raison D'Être,3.32,this was deeply appealing by description. not sure if it was the yeast or (maybe) bad bottle but the stuff was kind of bitter and frankly a bit nasty. scoring more objectively with benefit of the doubt.
6377,Raison D'Être,3.03,sampled bottle rbnag 2007 in grimstad. abv is 8%. amber to copper colour low head. boring aroma slightly malty. malty flavour notes of caramel hints of cinnamon.
6378,Raison D'Être,3.49,32oz crowler purchased two days ago at js liquor owensboro poured into a dfh branded teku glass at fridge temp 8% abv. the beer pours mostly bright medium brown with ruby highlights and essentially no head. no retention or lacing. the aroma is faint brown sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit. the taste is slightly sugary with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot barely bitter finish. not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. overall subpar. i got a stupid deal on this crowler ($5) and i imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping. i would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business. numerically rated close to the existing average for fairness.
6379,Raison D'Être,4.03,pours a dark nutty brown with a hint of burgundy. head is a finger of khaki foam. head retention is good. aroma is strong - plum dark fruits raisins fig and caramely malts. a little bit of alcohol seeps through but just barely. flavor profile carries the same profile forward hitting notes of plum dark fruits raisins fig and toffee with caramely nutty malts underneath. alcohol is a little more apparent here. mouth feel is full with a medium-thick consistency that firms up to thick when the glass has been warmed slightly. light graininess adds a little texture to each sip. overall heavy and full with strong raisins and dark fruit qualities.  served in a 15.5oz speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle. reviewed from notes.
6380,Raison D'Être,4.48,why is this no longer available in georgia. when craft beer and microbreweries first started to get popular in the metro atlanta region back in the early 2000s this was one of the very first beers that i saw from the movement. certainly without a doubt the first dogfish head i ever saw. i havent seen it round these parts in probably 13-14 years. too bad becauise this is a really good one and i wish i could have one right now
6381,Raison D'Être,4,ive had this. it makes me think of shawn gallaghers wedding. i went to visit shawn and we stopped at dogfish brewery. ah bliss i was like a kid in a candy store. i have fond memories of dogfish as it was the new yorker article about dogfish that got me into beer! as you can tell i am an intellectual aesthete
6382,Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.62,2021 vint 12 oz bottle into an oversized cognac snifter. pitch black. low foam leaves a lil ring of oily film instead. smells of dark chocolate vanilla caramel and bourbon. taste follows - cleans up with a zap of alcohol. feel is heavy - a stout stout. low to no carbonation. overall - if you an adjunct stout fan you’ll do cartwheels over this. meaty beaty big and bouncy.
6383,Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.5,#104 solid but prefer the o.g.
6384,Triple Citra Daydream,5,-look: beautiful deep-yellow haze with a thick clumpy head. -aroma: wow ripe orange and pineapple soft citrus and grapefruit. -taste: omg better than the aroma bursting with creamy soft citrus! -feel: soft and round tight but slippery. soft oat and hop milkshake. -overall: phenomenal never had such a burst of creamy citrus hops before!
6385,Triple Citra Daydream,4.59,poured from a 16oz can into a stemless wine glass. pours a thick hazy orangish yellow with a firm white foam head. peaches and candied oranges on the nose and taste. really citrus / fruit forward and really smooth for 10.5%. thick creamy mouthfeel. for some reason the nose on this one pops a little more than the taste. it still has amazing flavors though. a lot of time the ne tipas will get a little too sweet or boozey or both to me but this one is well balanced. really good stuff.
6386,Triple Citra Daydream,4.21,16oz can from tavour. thick hazy yellow golden pour thin skin of creamy off-white head. dank herbal floral aroma hint of onion. taste brings citrus of all varieties juicy citrus peel. lots of floral herbal notes too. creamy thick. abv sneaks up on you.
6387,Triple Citra Daydream,4.53,pours a light hazy vibrant golden color with a nice head and lacing aroma has very generous tropical and citrus hints the taste follows the nose with a very well balanced tropical and citrus flavor a medium bodied well carbonated beer a great milkshake ipa
6388,Triple Citra Daydream,4.54,canning date obstructed  tavour has hooked me up with the highest rated milkshake ipa on ba and it’s from other half no less. i’m very excited to try this one knowing the quality that other half consistently pushes out. let’s get right into it  pours a hazy milky yellow with 3 fingers of dense off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing  the nose has such a nice snap here but there’s still a rounded softness to it. i’m picking up on aromas of orange juice pineapple juice grassy hops bready malt red grapefruit white pepper sweet vanilla lychee dank weed and light mango  it keeps up that same balance of smooth with a bite in taste as well. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting underripe mango orange juice resinous hops bready malt pineapple juice dank weed light grass and red grapefruit. the swallow brings notes of orange juice sweet vanilla bready malt pineapple juice resinous hops lemon zest underripe mango light lychee white pepper and grass  a medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation resulting in a silky and juicy beer. finishes mostly dry and drinks well below its abv  this is awesome stuff. i’m glad i got ab extra can and it’s one i’ll likely pick up every time i see it on tavour or if i ever get to try it on tap
6389,Triple Citra Daydream,4.68,look - hazy thick tannish yellow with nice sticky lacing and a white head smell - resioney orange creamsicle taste - about like the smell but wow delicious! feel - full body creamy lighter carbonation overall - just fantastic. the creamsicle taste nails it!
6390,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.46,thank you @basaywhat  pours into glass black and starlys that way with a fizzy mocha head that goes away as quickly as it build. not much barrel on the nose but it comes in nicely on the palate along with some delicious coffee and cocoa flavors. chocolate and crystal type malts dance in there with no noticeable hops. worth seeking out.
6391,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.04,poured from a 12oz brown bottle – label notched 2018  bourbon barrel peruvian morning– brewers reserve poured an almost black/very dark brown with a thin tan head. the head dissipated rather quickly to a small and narrow collar of foam. the smell is dominated by coffee and bourbon from the oak barrels. the taste is of coffee and chocolate up front with hints of caramel and bourbon at the finish. mouth feel is high-medium to full with moderate carbonation. there is a little warming from the bourbon at the finish.  peruvian morning is a complex flavorful american imperial stout that is very drinkable for its high abv.
6392,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.19,very chilled bottle poured into my gi snifter. as it warms over 45 minutes the coffee and barrel presence become more pronounced with the barrel having the upper hand. i expected a bit more from this one; still a very good beer.
6393,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.52,l: very dark brown color almost no head not much lacing to speak of light carbonation.  s: chocolate coffee.  t: chocolate coffee sweet alcohol. very nice.  f: full; bodied full flavored.  o: a superb imperial stout more on the dessert side.
6394,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.21,a - dark brown-black mostly opaque with reddish highlights in the semi transparent edges. head is light tan minimal with an immediate fade and no lacing.  s - a nicely restrained barrel and vanilla booziness over a chocolate and coffee core.  t - follows the nose with a strong vanilla open a bright ice coffee middle with dark chocolate highlights and a finish with subtle acidity. delivers all the notes youd hope for with grace and almost delicate precision.  m - acidic but with mild carbonation and very light for the abv and flavor profile. a warm close and you come away with a mild lingering presence a trailing note that is quite pleasant.  o - a friend gave me a bottle and im quite glad to have tried this one. delicious.
6395,Truth,4.75,poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. super bowl kickoff beer. exceptionally thick. nice barrel. very creamy.
6396,Truth,4.08,after having batch 1 still truth back at row 34 in 2015 i thought they’d make better ba stouts in the future. guess i was mistaken / presumptive as this was definitively not that. barely any barrel tons of umami flavor thinner body. hmm.
6397,Memoria,4.47,poured from a growler.  pours a perfectly clear very pale gold color. there is a good three to four finger head on the beer as its poured but that dissipates pretty quickly. no real residual head remains just some blotchy foam. aroma is lovely - its got that rich doughy bready malt that only the best helles lagers have. there is a touch of honey and sweet bread along with some fleeting whiffs of grass.  taste is a bit unexpected. so there is that rich bready doughy character along with some sweet bread. the first unexpected character comes from this strong oaky character. this clearly comes from the oak puncheon it spends time in i just am kind of surprised at how much of that oaky character remains in the beer now. the next surprise is the finish on this. the flavor is kind of mild - dried grass and a slight hint of herbal notes from the hops but there is a stronger bitterness that lingers beyond the finish. the overall profile is not necessarily a traditional helles lager but it does taste delicious. feel is medium bodied doughy and smooth. carbonation is gentle smooth and lightly prickly. trends a bit dry on the finish.  overall its a lovely helles lager even if it is not strictly traditional. delicious and a joy to drink.
6398,Memoria,4.36,lightly foggy burnt straw yellow and like autumna before it with a thick level white head leaving beautiful layers of lace after sipping through the persistent blanket.  light corns present as a little toasty and while less bitter than autumna its still in the same vein and just absolutely bone dry. over time floral qualities develop. both that and the dryness keep it from expressing any sweetness as well as what seems may be mild oak tannins.
6399,Memoria,4.43,poured on draft at the brewery.  pours a cloudy pale gold color with a large creamy white head. great retention and lacing as always.  aromas of honey and fresh biscuits as well as grassy floral hops. theres a faint oak character throughout. very nice.  the flavor follows the nose. lots of sweet biscuits and honey balanced by grass and hops and a bit of earthy oak.  the feel is medium-light bodied with good carbonation. crisp and drinkable yet creamy and smooth with a dry-ish finish.  overall this is definitely one of the best lagers ive ever had. maybe its because its on draft at the source and hf beer just hits different on draft but this is such an amazing beer that i hope to try again.
6400,Memoria,4.25,good helles lager - solid beer.
6401,Memoria,5,absolutely amazing helles lager. poured on tap at hf.
6402,Memoria,4.61,on tap at hf.  thick creamy white head with lace. clear straw yellow.  one of the best helles i’ve had. so smooth and soft. earthy but creamy. biscuit and toasted crackers. grassy hops. faint bitterness. light bodied so incredibly drinkable.
6403,Union Jack IPA,4.21,this is an ultra classic american ipa with a surprising hop balance that results in a candied pineapple and pine profile that is more than the sum of its parts. the color is an immaculate clear gold without a trace of the lazy hazy. a really wonderful effort that has stood the test of time.
6404,Union Jack IPA,4.03,pours a clear orange-yellow frothy 0.5 of head that settles to a thick collar of foam. nose is spicy piney resinous hop and a fair amount of malt sweetness for balance. as it warms some more tropical juice notes as well. taste follows but expresses more of the spice and resin than the tropical aspects. finish is relatively dry with a clean and crisp mouthfeel. it\s really solid and reliable.
6405,Union Jack IPA,3.72,had this on tap and it pours very well. decent head retention and good lacing as you drink. smell is barely there for an ipa but tastes great. not too bitter and the hops really stand out. doesnt feel too full but not light either. perfect for a beer before dinner.
6406,Union Jack IPA,4.27,undated 12oz can single purchase. hazy gold one finger off white head leaves a nicely laced glass. terrific aromas of pineapple citrus and pine buds get big citrus flavors. excellent carbonation medium bodied. i rarely see fw beers in my neck of the woods od like to try this fresh.
6407,Union Jack IPA,4.04,12-oz can into new belgium globe  a - 1finger of white over a semi-cloudy body of amber; moderate visible carbonation  s - sweetness pine tropical fruits  t - honey sweetness pine tropical fruits maybe a little earthy; bright and fruity; nice balance between sweetness and bitterness; dry finish  m - medium body medium carbonation; smooth and creamy  o - balanced and refreshing
6408,Union Jack IPA,4,solid west coast ipa.
6409,Union Jack IPA,4.33,poured from a 12 ounce can into a shaker pint glass there is no best by date that i can see.  appearance: pours a clear copper color with one-finger off-white head that slowly dissipated until a thin broken layer of small bubbles remained lighter carbonation there is moderate lacing on the glass.  smell: initially sweet honey then equal parts pine resin and pineapple citrus.  taste: the taste follows the nose initially sweet honey then pine resin and pineapple citrus on the finish.  palate: medium body and lighter carbonation and somewhat creamy.  overall: this is a very well balanced ipa its hoppy but does not overpower your palate and sweet but not too sweet i really enjoyed this and will seek it out again i would recommend to anyone who enjoys a more balanced ipa.
6410,Society & Solitude #2,4.75,2 months old. can to wine glass.  l: pours a very dark brown almost black. the foam is fluffy and leaves a good amount of lacing. no floaters.  s: hoppy and malty at the same time. lemon and fresh orange cutting into roasty notes of dark chocolate.  t: malty roasty and bitter up front followed by fruity hop notes. lemon and orange again but rather candied than fresh. grapefruit‘s also there. so are piney and resiny notes.  f: full and smooth with a medium carbonation.  o: not a big fan of the style but this has to be the best black ipa i‘ve had so far. great balance very complex and clearly distinguishable hf. very good beer.
6411,Society & Solitude #2,4.3,canned on 1/11/23; consumed on 2/27/23  pours a stark jet-mahogany body topped with just under two fingers of rich tan foam; good head retention leaves a finger of cap moderate frothy collar and chunky rings accompanying a generous spatter of spotty lacing coating the walls of the glass.  aromas of milk chocolate intertwine with grapefruit peel as nutty malt interludes see earthy cacao nibs pronounced through subtle grassiness while accents of coffee meet a touch of spruce.  taste offers distant tones of peach pith easing to fresh coffee and a subtle malty char upfront: a chocolatey prickle through residual grapefruit over the mid-palate finds wisps of boggy spice and wet moss on the back end as a dank kiss of dark cocoa finishes.  mouthfeel brings a medium-light body and a rounded moderate carbonation; a creamy silk almost nitrogenated texturing supersedes a subdued prickly char drying steadily with a backing resinous sensation through the finish.  the eclectic embrace is delicate yet extensive cleanly displaying a quirky even interplay of both malt and hop character; a healthy marriage of contrast at peak attenuation for a typically polarizing style.
6412,Anchor Steam Beer,4.02,pours a handsome rich copper gold with a decent pillowy white head. the smell is biscuit and grain with a hint of hop. the taste is some caramel biscuit grain a little bitterness and a decent malt backbone. its very balanced drinkable and refreshing and had 2 of these after the diamondbacks baseball game in phoenix at hannys in downtown and sorry to see it go if it is indeed gone.
6413,Anchor Steam Beer,3.32,had to try it before it was discontinued. looks great but lacking in much flavor at all--everything feels muted. quite crushable though.
6414,Anchor Steam Beer,3.79,poured from a can into a pint glass. pours red orange with a fluffy white head. smells of sweet grain with just a tad of smoke. tastes of caramelized grain nice profile. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall a very good beer.
6415,Anchor Steam Beer,3.87,pours a copper color with a minimal head that lasts quite a while. aroma is floral notes and roasted malts. taste is peppery with a slightly bitter finish. had to try this one while it was still available in the stores.
6416,Anchor Steam Beer,3.77,poured from a 12 oz can dated 5/30/2023 into a willi becher pint glass. l - pours a dark amber color with a white head. s - smells malty and earthy. t - tastes of malt and caramel. f - medium body and carbonation. o - great beer when you plan on having a couple. it will be a shame to see her go.
6417,Anchor Steam Beer,4.29,on tap in san francisco in a pint glass look: transparent amber with about 1 finger of white head with decent retention. smell: subtle herbs and hops taste: clean and crisp. hints of malt and caramel. mouthfeel: light-medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. overall: i am extremely saddened to hear of anchor steam closing down (after 127 years): this is the end of an iconic american beer and brewery. i feel lucky to have had the opportunity to drink this beer on tap when it was still available.
6418,Anchor Steam Beer,3.59,malty with earthy hops. its crushable. a legend has become extinct.
6419,Anchor Steam Beer,3.64,a sad day indeed. we long ago sipped and enjoyed many an anchor product. several were taken down during the first few weeks of the covid lockdowns as there really wasn’t much else to do other than try new beer. we never put the beer into words. from memory though steam was a fantastic sipping beverage with its profile defining bitter hoppy bite. the history and tradition you could taste it. a real shame to hear earlier this week about the full closing of the brewery. the christmas ale was a staple of the holidays for the past number of year. a very sad day. pour one out for fritz.
6420,Anchor Steam Beer,4.13,draft pour into standard shaker pint glass. deep amber with a finger of dirty white foam head. malty and caramel-forward in the nose. taste mostly follows. maybe some earthy hops in the mix as well but it’s pretty simple in its structure. medium-full mouthfeel. fairly malty mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. i haven’t had this one in many many years but was glad to revisit. a craft beer classic.
6421,Anchor Steam Beer,2.76,look: beautiful amber color. thick white head with minor to moderate lacing.  smell: very clean simple malty bread aroma. not much going on but that’s not always a bad thing.  taste: watery malt. it’s simple clean and refreshing but the flavor profile is milder than i would prefer. somewhat of a lemony hops bitterness on the back end.  mouthfeel: thin and watery  overall: it’s an iconic trailblazer that is clean mild and refreshing but a little too simple and a little too watery for my tastes.
6422,Bleue (Blue),4.5,on tap! at stk in disney springs. goblet pour.  i’m in a nighttime restaurant so… it’s dark creamy off white cap lots of lacing.  sweet malt. lots of dark fruit; raisins plums and figs.  cream maple brown sugar and all of the dark fruit flavors.  near full body. smooth malt molasses and fermented fruits. rich and alcoholic.  so smooth that it tunes down the abv.
6423,Bleue (Blue),5,only one word: perfect. highly recommend drink in chimay glass cup
6424,Bleue (Blue),5,i love belgian beers and this one is my favorite! a pure masterclass on what a belgian beer should be. rochefort 8 is close but chimay blue is the standard of excellence. to me this style is slightly better than quads dubbels and trippels. chimay blue is my go-to for a tasty treat when im at good beer bars that carry it
6425,Bleue (Blue),4.74,so this review may not be wholly representative.  2000 bottle of chimay blue plucked from the depths of cafe kulminator by leen.  bottle is appropriately dusty and the cap is scratched but fully intact including the seal beneath.  the beer pour a deep burgundy red almost impenetrable by the lighting here it js still clear and clean.  the bottom of the bottle has a ring of sediment that goes unmoved even as the bottle is tilted past 90 degrees to the horizontal. amazing.  carbonation is still full but very soft. a thin 1/3” head persisted until my first taste. it can be regenerated with swirling.  nose is that off a well aged beer: lots of malt with a hint of wet basement. light floral notes persist.  this beer is amazingly smooth. everything blends together well and there’s bo hint of the abv. malt and belgian yeast dominate. this is from before the time when chimay changed out their fermenters.  compared to a fresh bottle this is something else entirely. they are related but distinctly different; a testament to dirk and leen’s care and attention.  there are few places that revere chimay like kulminator. you would do well to visit and try some. better yet come with a small group (3) and try a multi-decade vertical.  enjoy it while you can. these bottles and bars are ever more limited.
6426,Bleue (Blue),4.76,ruby-brown. fizzy yet creamy head. great head retention. sweet cherry candy fruity aroma. some spice aroma. toffee tobacco brown sugar molasses. creamy somewhat heavy mouthfeel. amazing complex beer.
6427,Bleue (Blue),4.85,malty toasty roasty not too hoppy not too sweet but enough sweetness to balance the roasty malts. 9% but not hot. unbelievable complexity. shifts flavors in the way only fermented foods can. different notes come out with every sip: dried fruit molasses bread chocolate honey spices graham crackers balsamic vinegar. this is top-tier for me.
6428,Bleue (Blue),4.51,june 2023. hartwell. always a solid beer.
6429,Bleue (Blue),4.38,pours a deep dark brown with a 2 toasted marshmallow head that has serious retention and lacing. nose is sweet raisin baked brown bread clove and baking spice toasted brown sugar and molasses apple cider gingerbread. unlike many in the style the raisin notes isn\t overly sweet or treacly but instead is very well balanced. taste is similarly balanced - dark fruit (prunes dark cherries) pumpernickel bread and a surprising amount of earthy hop. the hop element keeps things from becoming overly sweet and as a result its surprisingly drinkable at 9%. there is a big alcohol kick on the palate but it isn\t overwhelming. finish is more hop keeping things pretty tannic and some grassiness. mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the abv and with small champagne-like carbonation.
6430,Bleue (Blue),3.83,poured from a bottle into a snifter. bready aroma. i like the flavor of this beer however the high carbonation mouthfeel is something im really not crazy about.
6431,Bleue (Blue),4.04,330ml. bottle in vientiane laos. pours a dark brown with a medium foamy head. aroma of dark fruits caramel malt floral. taste of malts yeast plums. strong alcohol notes with a bitter finish but not overpowering.
6432,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.35,love it
6433,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.56,this isnt so much a review as synchronicity. i had a choice at the local liquor store between this and north coast old rasputin. as i sipped this i said to myself (just prior to rating) this tastes a lot like old rasputin. and when i rated it i came up with 4.56- exactly what i rated old rasputin! this is a good thing because i like a thicker richer stout and this qualifies. the aroma right out the can is knockout and after the first couple sips i doubt i could tell it from or.
6434,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.14,it’s toasty and malty it’s chocolatey it’s got coffee there’s licorice and a hint of spicy hops. overall there is a lot going on and a good balance of flavors.
6435,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.14,l: motor oil. uneven toffee brown head. s: light and sweet. caramel nuts notes of leather and vanilla and cookie dough. some bourbon too. t: more bitter than the nose. very roasty upfront with leather and a bit of char then caramel and a bit of hoppiness finishing with coffee and dark chocolate. notes of vanilla and cookie dough throughout. f: medium bodied silky smooth alcohol is fairly masked. o: definitely more of a ris than an oatmeal not that i’m disappointed at all. would love to try the ba version.
6436,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,3.44,looks like soupy molasses with a short brown head that quickly dissipates. syrup film lace on the glass. smell and taste: chocolate and coffee. pungent sour notes that i dont care for. feel: well im guessin with 9.4% abv ill be feelin pretty good by the time i finish it. overall: not my cup of tea. im hopin on.
6437,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.4,visually beautiful it pours out silky and thick - very impressive sweet and inviting in the nose this ris was one of the better ones i’ve had. taste is slightly muted but still good the alcohol is barely noticeable…until it hits then you can’t escape it. this was really a very good ris. one to keep in mind for the cookies months ahead.
6438,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.64,traded a dark lord for one of these in like 2010? maybe 2009 or 2011. but definitely a long time ago. this fucker has been aging.  pour is inky black but still very nicely fizzy. wisp of a brown head. really incredible pour considering the strength and age.  aroma is likewise surprisingly bright and nice. i remember someone in some vague context telling me i had been hosed in the trade. i dunno. back then i was lousy with fff rarities. this wears its age nicely and theres no hint that it wouldnt have been good-to-great if consumed several years earlier. very dark chocolate and coffee some pleasantly sharp grain. the nodes that are discernably aged mellow it out but dont overwhelm it with the sort of overripe fruit nodes that often denote staleness.  flavor is again surprisingly great. it tastes like a more or less fresh double stout only wonderfully smoothed over. aggressive but never overwhelming. dark dark dark and bitter chocolate up front bittersour grain in the middle and a wee bitty kiss o the hops on the finish.  maybe im just an aging man with atavistic pretensions. maybe beers were just better before the market got oversaturated. i dunno. what i do know is i liked this quite a bit.
6439,Keystone Premium,5,i have drank many different beers over the years. iron city and lite rolling rock bud and bud light coors light yuengling... and keystone premium is by far my favorite. a very nice balance of taste. not heavy and bitter but not too light and sweet either. i pray that they never stop making it!
6440,Keystone Premium,1.59,ice cold on a hot day and it was still disgusting. my neighbor handed me one out of his cooler while i was doing yard work. the taste is metallic and skunky. there are notes of corn and grains for something positive. smell is very similar to the taste only less intense on the metallic aspect. mouth feel is pretty much the same as water. probably the worst beer i have ever tasted.
6441,Keystone Premium,1.93,very similar to coors banquet with the sweet malts/corn and hiccup causing finish. only real difference is the alcohol is strangely more noticeable.
6442,Keystone Premium,1.51,well here comes more of that urine and garbage liquid yellow blended with water. doesnt for a head. a mixture of metal corn futuristic aluminum space ship alloys and molecular aromas your primitive nose wouldnt understand.  taste takes on a weird subtle physical matter in the liquid aspect water and sawdust from the corn husks used a malt. i dont understand what made this premium at all. more barley? barf city. notice i didnt talk about hops or yeast? yeah not sure theyre here. somehow this is worse than keith stone light.
6443,Sunday Brunch,4.5,12/8/2015
6444,Sunday Brunch,4.59,appearance: sunday brunch pours a deep dark brown color with a thick creamy head that dissipates slowly.  aroma: the aroma is rich and complex with strong notes of coffee dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. there are also hints of toasted oak and a slight smokiness.  taste: the flavor is bold and intense with a strong coffee profile and a noticeable alcohol warmth. the dark chocolate and vanilla flavors are present as well with a slight sweetness that balances the bitterness from the coffee. there is a slight smokiness in the aftertaste that lingers on the palate.  mouthfeel: the mouthfeel is silky smooth with a creamy texture that coats the tongue. the beer is medium-bodied and has a medium carbonation level making it easy to drink.  overall impressions: kane brewing sunday brunch is a complex and flavorful beer that is perfect for sipping on a lazy sunday morning. the coffee chocolate and vanilla flavors combine perfectly to create a decadent and satisfying experience. the alcohol warmth is noticeable but not overpowering making it a great choice for those who enjoy a bit of a kick with their morning coffee. the smoky finish is a nice touch adding an unexpected depth to the flavor profile. overall this is a top-notch imperial porter that is well worth trying.
6445,Sunday Brunch,4.71,deep dark black. head was not as dark as i guessed it would be more of an off white color. strangely the nose is cinnamon at first but after first taste then the nose was more coffee. taste was cinnamon coffee with a smooth finish. not bitter all smooth!! great porter.
6446,Sunday Brunch,3.69,2022-02-06 500ml bottle served in a footed pilsner glass. 2021 vintage. received from the glorious @jonphisher.  pours very dark brown with a small head that fades slowly to an almost invisible skin and a small ring around the glass. smell is chocolate and cinnamon.  taste is cinnamon first and all else second. milk chocolate is definitely there. some coffee bitterness. might be a hint of syrupy sweetness.  mouthfeel is medium tending toward thick. overall this is a good beer but too much cinnamon for me. but im a little oversensitive to cinnamon in beer.
6447,Sunday Brunch,4.85,pours black with a light brown solid head. super coffee roast aroma very pungent. taste is heavy coffee as well with a lot of maple sweetness; the cinnamon comes through strong as well. thick mouthfeel carbonation was a little lacking which is pretty much the only flaw in this excellent beer.
6448,Corona Light,1.6,yea if your desperate.
6449,Corona Light,2.06,left in the can. aroma is sweet corn. tastes metallic some fruity notes malt. it’s not too too bad at first glance i had it rated 2.75 for taste but then an absolutely horrible aftertaste comes in and lingers. mouthfeel is ok. overall it just isn’t very good and for the price there are much better light options available
6450,Corona Light,1.98,pours out of the can a crystal clear golden-orange. yields a finger of fizzy head that dissipates quickly. smells like sweet corn and malts. taste follows the nose. not too much going on here. you like it or you dont. its pretty basic.
6451,Corona Light,3.63,the more beers i try the more i realize that what people think are bad or what people think are great are blinded by their pretentious ideas of what they should be like. taste like everything personal is subjective i try to rate and enjoy as objective and also subjective as i possibly can no matter the style or my prefered tastes.  that said i do like me some light beers and im surprised it took me more than 500 different beers tried before i got to this one. this is beer 514 (actually more but some i couldnt find on here) and with that accumulated experience i will say this is a fine if not damn decent light beer. blew my expectations away and i think i prefer it to the extra or premier. i work 5-6 days a week i like something quick and refreshing after a 10+ hour day and this does it. smooth drinkability with a light crisp feel to go down easy like others of this style relaxing and enjoyable on a hot day. (or after a laborious shift). nothing complicated or a lot to process just a clean beer to drink.  will it be my preferred beer of choice? no i like to change it up every so often but i think i will fit this into my normal rotation.
6452,Corona Light,1.6,i really like corona extra and premier so i figured i would go for the light this time. that was where it all went wrong. i opened the first bottle after chilling it and it smelled like cigarettes. i got past it by giving the bottle a few more sniffs but the smell was not like the other corona i have had. the taste was also very bitter and rough not very smooth not a good flavor compared to the others.  pretty disappointed hopefully it doesnt ruin extra and premier for me.
6453,Corona Light,2.73,ive been waiting my whole life for this. its the first time ive ever gotten a corona light when i asked for it. ive never even seen it at grocery stores. although to be fair ive only looked once or twice--but god damn this was at huge box stores with massive macro selections. to be perfectly honest i was damn near certain this was a hoax that didnt actually exist. so it was to my utter surprise that our local dirt cheap mexican restaurant not only listed it on their menu but actually delivered it to the table as ordered. thus was my ultimate bucket list whale slayed.  the overall experience is as expected light ricey skunk. however it was also surprisingly toasty. i typically find the lighter versions of macro lagers to be the lesser of its representations but since i have only ever had regular corona extra up until now i\m finding myself flummoxed that i\m not entirely sure that light is the worse of the two. bottle to bottle i\d probably take this over extra. even the lightly fluffy medium body isn\t impacted too terribly by the lightening.  to wrap this up the appearance within a lime wedged bottle--which itself i find slightly less attractive than extra--is otherwise lightly chill-hazed piss yellow with after a tilt a relatively active but rapidly receding carbonation.  dont worry i removed the lime wedge and serviced the tip liberally prior to this exhaustive review.  enjoy.
6454,Corona Light,1.77,had this at a friends house since that was all that they had. it really was offensive but i drank it anyway. wow. i thought regular corona was drinkable when really thirsty but this light version is just not worth it.
6455,Corona Light,2.62,12 oz. can best by 8/22 i spent twenty years drinking mostly corona-bud light-miller lite so the smell and flavor of this beer are very familiar. the game changer is canning. this is the first non-skunked corona i can remember. so to start the worst flaw is gone. clear gold with one finger fine white head. spotty lacing partial surface ring. corn light floral pale malt bready odors. not much flavor light apple corn grass. it’s fine if that is what you are accustomed to. light hop zing low carbonation  dry finish. insubstantial but no glaring flaws. wet and alcoholic. cheers!
6456,Corona Light,1.56,what could be worse than perpetually skunky and corny beer?  how about watered-down corny skunk.  i never expect good choices at holiday picnics but this is a new low.
6457,Corona Light,2.5,much better beer in a can
6458,Peche Du Fermier,4.58,look - thick peach juice with a nice white head rimming and lacing smell - complex ripe candied tart peach taste - follows close to the smell with a nice woody oak backbone feel - medium bdoy and carb overall - just fantastic!!!
6459,Peche Du Fermier,4.55,pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. a few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. the level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. aroma is immediate peaches but theyre soft and delicate. it leans slightly into tart but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. faint cellar stone oak and grass occupy the rest of the nose rounding out the depth. peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. flavor profile leads with peaches again but leans into tart more so than the nose. its a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits cellar stone grass lemon zest and soft wood. front third is fruited with the back third being all base saison. the middle is a blend of the start and finish. just like the nose the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature and with that it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. still no puckering sourness but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. no puckering or tart finish with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. mouth feel is medium in thickness. it nearly falls flat on the tongue with the initial portion being crisp. overall peach addition is wonderful with the rest of the profile being a steadfast focused and balanced saison. its not overly acidic or tart providing just enough tartness to offer contrast without forcing it into sour territory.  blend #2. served in a 15.5oz speigalau tulip from a 750ml bottle.
6460,Minhas Light,2.25,just a light beer. 2010/09/06
6461,Minhas Light,1.5,blech.
6462,Minhas Light,2.6,poured from a can into a pint glass  appearance – the beer pours a light golden color with a fizzy white head. the head fades super fast leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass.  smell –the aroma of the brew is mostly of a corn smell mixed with a little bit of a musty aroma.  taste-the taste begins with a sweeter corn syrup taste mixed with a little bit of a grain. as the taste moves on some lighter flavors of caramel and even more corn come to the tongue. in the end one is left with a somewhat more sweet corn cereal taste to linger on the tongue.  mouthfeel – the body of the brew is very thin and light with a carbonation level that is rather average. the thin body is prime for the sweeter and subdued tastes of the brew. a little higher carbonation would have been slightly better for the lightness of the brew but even so the feel was alright overall.  overall – for a 4% abv. brew that clocks in at only ~95 calories i am not going to expect a flavor powerhouse. nothing is really off in the taste but nothing is really on either. it is sort a standard light brew overall.
6463,Minhas Light,2.85,poured from a 12 oz. can. has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. smell has some light hints of corn but is odorless for the most part. taste has more flavor than i expected. corn grains some malts a bit of green apples. feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer. considering the brewery and the beer style mediocre is pretty good in this case.
6464,Minhas Light,3.23,well....better than bud light and quite honestly if u drink light beer this is a good alternative to the big brand guys it has better flavor and ur paying 9.50$ for 24 beers
6465,Minhas Light,2.92,appearance - light yellow. very clear and very bubbly. short and very short-lived sudsy white head.  smell - light and very sweet pale malts. corn and candy.  taste - sweet and corny but obviously quite light. light pale malts with no apparent hops character. slight metallic tang and a little bit of a cloying aftertaste.  mouthfeel - light and crisp.  overall - pretty inoffensive and refreshing. judging by some of minhas other efforts this could be much worse. as is its a decent low priced stand in for the more flavorful of the macrolager lights.
6466,Minhas Light,1.9,bought a case a few weeks ago. it was cheap and i didnt really want to spend too much on beer at the time. 10 dollars for a 30 pack will do.  not even going to pour this into a glass its not worth it.  smell: very fruity. thats about all i get. fruitiness and maybe the slightest bit of a used up hop smell.  taste: well its light alright. water fruit corn and a ghosting of stale hops. cant really expect too much from this.  mouthfeel: decently carbonated and very thin. watery the whole way through. it goes down very easy to say the least.  overall its not vomitrocious. its not good either. i cant say i will be picking this one up again.
6467,Minhas Light,1.66,so it was $2.29 for a 6 pack. decided to take a shot with the goading of my co-worker.  pours super pale yellow huge head that actually leaves a bit of lacing on the plastic hotel cup (im classy fuck you).  smell is um..not pleasant. something offputting about it. not beery at all.  taste is well ive had worse tastes like a macro light no worse than bud light and a crap load cheaper.  mouthfeel is water strike that its carbonated water. kinda like h2oh if youve ever had that.  drinkability. ive already 4 in and have one more to finish along with 2 more new glarus the fact that i can still type after 10 beers in the last hour says to me that it is pretty sessionable. not that it tastes good but at this point im really not getting the full flavor and it hasnt made me puke yet so bottoms up.  in short cheap beer not objectionable if you are just looking to get hammered in the cheapest way possible and you have something against malt liquor. but if you want beer then dont buy this.
6468,Minhas Light,1.73,bought a case of this (24pack) for 5 bucks... hard to beat that!  a- pale yellow a bit of fizzy head that immediately reduces to nothing.  s- doesnt smell like much.. maybe a bit of hops mixed with lots of water..  t- tastes just like it smells... like water and bit of sweetness coming from something. the good news is it doesnt leave too much of an aftertaste.  m- the mouthfeel? put water in your mouth and see for yourself.  d- this beer is pretty sessionable for me. while i dont think the taste is great the lack of a bad aftertaste is a plus for me and i have no problem throwing 10-15 of these back in a night. i cant say the same about some other macro brews.  if you are looking for the cheapest reasonable beer possible to get drunk id recommend minhas. it definitely isnt any worse than your typical macro brews but about a third of the price. if you are looking for good beer avoid at all costs.
6469,Centennial IPA,3.75,pours a reddish copper with a generous off-white head. fragrance of pine and citrus. tastes of pine citrus and caramel malt. mildly bitter with a hint of sweetness.  another fine product from founders.
6470,Centennial IPA,4.59,slight reddish tinge to otherwise fairly clear brew. slight pine (?spruce) note as the hoppiness comes roaring through. an ipa lovers delight for sure.
6471,Centennial IPA,4.75,well ill be honest this is my go-to ipa! hoppy goodness with an outstanding malt-balance. great amber color. hoppy yet sweet aroma. bitter yet sweet flavor. its in my fridge at all times! bonus alert: i get a 15-pack at the local for $16.99! cha-ching! there is nothing i dont like about this beer!
6472,Centennial IPA,4.11,this is my everyday beer. its the best at its price point although to be fair there arent many 7% beers under $20 for a fifteen-rack. it has some lovely complex sunny bitterness with some unfortunate blandness in the aftertaste that would work well for someone new to hops compared with some other heavy ipas. smooth for 7.2% but it lacks some of the fruity and citric complexity of its baby cousin the founders all day ipa. this is not a special occasion beer. its just a solid everyday sipper.
6473,Centennial IPA,4.53,very close to a personal fave ipa standard set by bell’s two hearted. it’s not quite northern midwest but way good especially at $18.50 a 15-pack… (!)
6474,Centennial IPA,4.22,if you’re new to the ipa-craft beer scene or not… this one is very good. not to mention that it comes in a 15 pack and costs a bit less than 12 packs of other fine ipas. the beer is outstanding! this is a win win!
6475,Centennial IPA,5,i have tried many ipas and this is one of my favorites. i enjoy it so much i made an account here just to say its definitely worth trying if you enjoy a good ipa.
6476,Centennial IPA,3.88,pretty great. pours clear with a long-lasting frothy head. aroma is citrusey and a bit less hoppy than other ipas ive tried. flavor is clean citrusey and crisp. while it is of course hoppy it is very well-balanced by the malt giving it a very easy-to-drink character. honestly need to be a bit careful drinking this given how light it tastes for the alcohol content. nothing unusual here just a great example of an ipa. punches far above its weight for the price (20 bucks for a 15-pack).
6477,Centennial IPA,4.21,very surprised i ad not reviewed this beer previously. sorry i did not because this is a great beer.  poured from a can into a tulip glass. darkish golden yellow color with a wonderful fluffy beige head and nice curtain lacing. smell and taste of pine and citrus. floral and slightly herbal. vanilla and orange. slightly bitter finish and nice malty background. definitely will have this beer again.
6478,Centennial IPA,4.77,one of the very best widely available ipas.
6479,I Let My Tape Rock,4.5,bba from wakefest 2022 pours dark and fairly thick minimal head. has some coconut floaters. massive chocolate aroma mixes with light coffee and sweet vanilla; coconut lingers on the finish. flavor is molten chocolate espresso lava cake chocolate covered coconut flakes i get a little cherry cordials on the finish. thick and creamy yet there is a hint of lively carbonation. overall an amazing beer a year old and the coconut is still there.  4/5/23 bomber 4.5 rating
6480,I Let My Tape Rock,4.8,batch 1: glad to have tried this coconut dreamboat! coconut rocks abound plus rich vanilla cocoa maple and awesome rye to balance everything out. super thicc old school jwb mouthfeel; super impressed by this gem!
6481,I Let My Tape Rock,4.69,had in 2018 was probably my favorite j. wakefield to date. great collaboration of flavors and enjoyed this a lot. thought feel could have been a little better.
6482,Munzler's Vienna Lager,5,beautiful. sure to delight any lager fan. earthy toasted brown bread with a crisp minerality. could have 6 of these easily.
6483,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.25,appearance: pours a slightly hazy golden tinged amber color with a two finger head; excellent retention that leaves speckles of lace  smell: toasted bread earthy tones and vienna malt (sweet but just shy of caramel)  taste: vienna malt flavors forward with earthy toasted bread tones tempering; a bit grassy through the middle to add some bitterness but the vienna malt is the star here  mouthfeel: medium body with moderate carbonation  overall: olde meck does a great job with this brew; truly befits the style
6484,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.3,it is one of the easiest most sessionable vienna lagers ive had. not too sweet nor too much caramel. its really subtle in flavors and finishes crisp and refreshing. a good lager option.
6485,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.43,on tap at the brewery. clear copper color three fingers fine white head full lacing curtains. roast malt floral bready aromas. sweet caramel pear light floral and roast malt flavors. smooth light mouthfeel outstanding carbonation. i will join the high ratings an outstanding vienna lager one of the best omb beers.
6486,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.78,poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass a 2 sudsy off white head drops quickly. abundant carbonation in amber colored liquid. rich malty aroma. mouthfeel is fairly light with a dry finish. flavors of caramel toasted malt raisin and some citrus hops in the finish. overall: extremely good!
6487,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.65,poured from a 12 oz bottle into an olde meck tall mug  the beer pours a clear deep copper color with ruby highlights and 3 fingers worth of off-white head that slowly recedes to a small cap  the aroma is bready toasted malts caramel and just a hint of floral hops. very clean and inviting  the taste is much like the aroma; bready and toasty with some sweet caramel notes and just enough hop presence to balance the beer out. quite delicious  medium/light mouthfeel with moderate carbonation  overall this is a phenomenal beer. probably my favorite example of the style so far
6488,Munzler's Vienna Lager,5,on draft. deep copper colored. no head. smell is sweet malts. flavor is also malty sweet and amazing. this is by far the best vienna lager ive ever had so it gets a 5 across the board from me.
6489,Munzler's Vienna Lager,4.5,the olde mecklenburg brewery does it again! i would swear i was actually in germany drinking this. very authentic vienna lager. crisp and piney. i am not good at picking out raisins plums wood chips or iron filings. but i can you from experience this is the bomb!
6490,Munzler's Vienna Lager,3.92,12 oz bottle poured into a long tulip glass. a clear orange/brown with ruby highlights and a one finger white head that retains nicely. the aroma is toasted grains and floral hop notes. the taste is right in line. mouthfeel is light carbonation medium. a well made straightforward vienna.
6491,KBS - Blueberry,3.92,l: pours thick dark chocolate forming a thin light tan head that dissipates quickly. thin layer of film retention as a result of lingering effervescence which also contributes to a ring of lacing around the edge of the snifter. near-black hue.  s: loads of chocolate coffee and barrel. the blueberries add a mild fruity aroma which pairs nicely. trace oak and vanilla.  t: tart blueberries added to the original kbs formula - tons of chocolate coffee bourbon barrel and vanilla. tastes like dessert.  f: medium bodied silky mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  o: this beer is a nice concept but this iteration of kbs is inferior to the chocolate-cherry iteration. the blueberries overpower the remaining flavors resulting in a beer that is too tart and almost resembles a sour. every other kbs is solid so this earns a mulligan.
6492,KBS - Blueberry,4.21,a - pours pitch black with a one finger tan head. the head fades into a thin ring leaving a good amount of soapy lacing.  s - aroma is tart blueberries dark chocolate and coffee.  t - the taste is sweet and tart blueberries dark chocolate coffee vanilla oak and a nice bourbon finish.  m - medium body with medium carbonation. creamy mouthfeel with a crisp drying finish.  o - really solid kbs variant.
6493,KBS - Blueberry,3.99,pours a beautiful dark chocolate with a two finger head. aroma is deeply bourbon chocolate and blueberry. taste is less complex with blueberry first then bourbon. chocolate follows at the end. still one of the better blueberry brews out there.
6494,KBS - Blueberry,4.5,pours jet black with a 1 1/2 finger tan head with retention and lacing. nice aroma with chocolate coffee blueberries oak bourbon vanilla and cocoa. the taste matches the aroma perfectly. has a sweet chocolate and charred malt aftertaste for balance. the blueberry has some sweetness up front and finishes a little bitter which also shows some nice balance. medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. the aftertaste is more sweet than bitter. a nice combination of flavors and a nice beer.
6495,KBS - Blueberry,2.63,appearance - the beer was silky black with a tan head.  smell - the nose smelled of underripe blueberries corrupting a once great stout.  taste - underripe sour blueberries led the way. what once made kbs great now tastes like sour. i never imagined kbs and sour patch kids would be a good idea. it even lingered sour in the back of my throat.  mouthfeel - the body seemed thinner than regular kbs.  overall - founders please stop doing horrible things to kbs.
6496,KBS - Blueberry,4.21,12oz bottle poured into a snifter  a- pours jet black with a one-finger creamy khaki head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind  s- aroma is a bit more subtle than expected but gets better as it warms. plenty of jammy blueberry leads the way along with chocolate. not picking up a lot of barrel bit it does have that signature kbs charred malty undertone  t- immediate thought is that it tastes just like a blueberry tootsie pop; candy like blueberry notes with a blast of chocolate that tastes just like a tootsie roll. mid-palate brings out just a hint of tartness from the blueberry as well as a light barrel note that adds caramel and light oak. the finish gives more sweet blueberry and chocolate with some light bourbon popping our on the linger  m- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into the finish abv hidden well
6497,KBS - Blueberry,4.68,brief review:  o: and the kbs variants keep rolling! we follow up the cherry chocolate with another fruit-forward one. this one nails it! the blueberry is almost perfectly integrated. sweetness accentuates the chocolate and barrel. fruit juice adds to the body. reminds me of lizard of koz obviously but it’s simpler which is nice.  recommendation: probably my favorite kbs variant thus far next to espresso. must-try.
6498,KBS - Blueberry,4.22,bottled 7/10/23  it’s been a while since i’ve had anything new from founders but i couldn’t resist a new kbs variant. blueberry seems like an odd choice for it though i do tend to enjoy fruited stouts when they’re properly executed. let’s pop it open and see what it has to offer  pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing  the blueberry in the nose is quite gentle almost like they just used a fruity coffee. i’m picking up on aromas of dark roast coffee jammy blueberry milk chocolate maple syrup toasted oak vanilla light cinnamon and a touch of bourbon  there’s much more blueberry in taste and it brings a nice tartness to it. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting tart blueberry medium roast coffee dark chocolate toasted oak burnt caramel vanilla earthy bourbon black cherry and light molasses. the swallow brings notes of medium roast coffee tart blueberry red grape maple syrup dark chocolate charred oak earthy bourbon molasses light raisin and vanilla  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer. finishes mostly dry with a fruity tartness that dries things out even further  this isn’t my favorite variant but it’s still very enjoyable. prehaps i’ll pick up a few more bottles
6499,Carling Beer,2.02,cerveza popular en inglaterra. tiene una gran cabeza blanca. es de cuerpo ligero y con alta carbonatación. aroma y sabor cítrico. para tomar con pocas pretensiones.
6500,Carling Beer,2.93,had this in a few different pubs in england  its nothing special and it isnt even really good but imo its still better than bud light  im an ipa man myself but i wanted to try something different. was still better than a few of the aal/epl i had in europe
6501,Carling Beer,2.79,from a can pours a bright gold colour with a good thick white head that disapates but laces well. aroma grass grain bread corn. taste malt corn malt sweet crisp and clean.
6502,Carling Beer,3.25,from hipecor. 50cl can. in ikeas pint glass. reading cshtp6 ch7. much more balanced than other adjunt lagers with the corn little noticeable. very drinkable and smooth. good body for its low abv.
6503,Carling Beer,2.25,pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aroma has slight malt hints the taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent beer
6504,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),4.03,canned 8.1.23  purchased at the dabc for $2.09 (dumb price)  poured at fridge temp into a dimple mug  pours clear darker golden with some amber tints and a generous 3f head. settled down into a mid ring and cap. 4  hop punch is the first thing that came to mind. pungent clear and clean distinctly noble/earthy. 4  big biscuit and earthy hops. some light bread crust and hint of pepper. 4  body is a sweet spot i think the 6% abv lends toward a just above medium body that has a touch of chewiness and heft. 4.25  overall this was one i thoroughly enjoyed and makes me nearly reconsider my preference of märzen. 4
6505,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),4.15,if you were a fan as i was of the 2021 oktoberfest from sn (couldn’t get the 2022) you will be disappointed with this most recent version. don’t get me wrong it’s a nice little beer just nowhere the same. more hops less caramel less body less mouthfeel different style. i encourage others to try just one bottle/can and decide for yourself before expecting this beer to live up to its once great reputation.
6506,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),4.02,canned 7/23/2023  appearance - golden amber body with white head  smell - toasted grain biscuit  taste - malty biscuit dough toasted grain hint of honey  mouthfeel - medium bodied medium plus carbonation slight malt sweetness upfront snappy hops on the back end  overall - this is a rock solid version of a festbier easy drinking and enjoyable - certainly worth a try  price point - $2.99/ 12 oz can
6507,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),4.03,appearance: clear gold big head.  smell: hay mild sweetness.  taste: mild sweetness honeyed bread then a little hoppy spiciness. more bread and light spice maybe some hay notes. nice drinking with medium body not too filling.  overall: a very nice octoberfest wiesn beer i much prefer this style over marzen style. this is a little spicy-hoppy but thats fine with me a very good beer to my taste buds.
6508,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),2.16,ugh! buy something else. this is the worst oktoberfest i have ever had. i will never buy it again. if i could return it to the store i would. its that bad.
6509,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),2.06,smell: beer look: its in a can taste: yuck-- its an ipa pour: down the drain.
6510,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.25,copper in color. smells & tastes hoppy. after reading the description of the beer the punch of hops was their goal but i think it’s too hoppy for an octoberfest beer style.
6511,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.73,had oktoberfest festbier (2023) poured from 12-oz. can bottom stamped pkgd 072423 into tall seidel.  pours deep almost copper gold with clarity and 1-finger foamy off-white head which quickly dissipates to a persistent film leaving little lace. mild grassy and floral hop and biscuit malt aromas off pour with the biscuit growing and the hops lessening as warms. on tasting begins mild sweet biscuit malt which carries a ways into a (very) little tart stone fruit and then into a drying clean slightly floral neutrally bitter finish.  long sweet malty pull with just enough hop flavor and bite in the finish to remind you to enjoy the several youre gonna pound.
6512,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.83,l-two fingered frothy headed festbier with a golden amber body. nice and lively carbonation as well. s-toasted malts bready and buttery cracker combined with sweet grain. caramel honey apple juice pear and molasses is there as well. t-a sweet grainy wheaty and slightly spicy flavor. nice and malt forward that expresses notes of sweet apple and honey. nice bitter finish. f-what youd expect. crisp and refreshing. o-overall a really solid festbier that gets me in the mood for oktoberfest and the cooler months to come. this would go great with some schnitzel or bratwurst. i would absolutely have this again.
6513,Oktoberfest (Festbier 2023),3.25,the pour is straw colored with a head of foam that dissipated quicker than i expected but the carbonation is looking lively in my beer mug. the taste is white bread grains faint earthy hop presence faint lemon along with a touch of floral near the finish. all in all this beer is too bitter to be called a festbier but its okay. cheers! b-
6514,Negra Modelo,4.69,a great beer and fan of modelo always!
6515,Negra Modelo,3.34,it reminds me exactly of a better version of michelob™ dark and im talkin the dont be afraid of the dark era with martin mull circa 1987 - 1992. its a very drinkable not heavy dark beer. very malt forward so theres no confusing this for an ipa! but with this beer thats a good thing!
6516,Negra Modelo,3.56,it tastes okay. its not a heavy taste but its not a light taste either. im not much of an alcohol drinker so two is enough for me and it makes me feel mellow/ relaxed. it would be great to taste this with a shot of evan williams in it. dark beer with a shot of evan williams in it just tastes awesome. the packaging is very nice with the gold foil top. beautiful. i also really like the short chuby bottles just a nice presentation / well done.
6517,Negra Modelo,5,presentation wise the bottle has a very comfortable shape to hold and it comes in a gold foil wrapper so every beer feels like you’re unwrapping a gift. it’s a dark lager so of course it tastes good. i wish it was a few dollars cheaper but it’s a good beer to pick up once a blue moon.  style: dark lager | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 5.4% | rating: 5
6518,Negra Modelo,4.25,one of the best beers for mexican and new mexican food. every time i drink this i am whisked back to albuquerque in the 90s eating green chile enchiladas at el patio. que rico.
6519,Negra Modelo,4,one of my favorites...nice scent and good depth to the flavor...
6520,Negra Modelo,3.33,from the back of the bottle printed on glass with white ink spots: bb nov 2023 c273b159 11:14.  appearance: the body is a medium shade of dark brown with light hints of golden brown and burnt umber. it is a dark beer but it has good clarity and ample carbonation bubbles are clearly visible. there is a medium-sized head which mostly has larger bubbles but there are smaller ones surrounding them. it has a tobacco-stained off-white head. the head retention is pretty good and it slowly fades out to a short cap. no real lacing.  aroma: there is a light toasty caramel scent with a light nutty yeast note.  taste: it has a light toasted caramel flavor up front. the middle of the palate has a bit of a bread character with a nutty flavor. it has a bit of a walnut and acorn character. some pecan notes come through eventually too. a bit of alcohol develops after a few sips. the aftertaste is a light herbal bitterness.  mouthfeel: it straddles the edge between light and medium bodied. it feels more medium as it first hits the palate but it doesnt have much texture when moving to the back. carbonation feels high but good. there is a mild but noticeable bitterness.  overall: the text on the label states that this is a medium-bodied lager with slow-roasted caramel malts brewed for a rich smooth taste. that is a pretty fair description of the beer. the body feels a tad low but it is a nice beer to drink. it has a nutty flavor and aroma which gives the beer more depth as well. i probably wouldn\t buy it regularly but it\s an enjoyable beer.
6521,Ephraim,4.25,picked-up two four-packs of cans at hill farmstead brewery in greensboro bend vermont for about twenty two dollars. my twenty first brew from these guys. good but a bit overrated for me.
6522,Ephraim,4.43,look - nice hazy tannish orange with a ncie white head rimming and lacing smell - more faint than i would guess. mostly citrus slight floral dank taste - dank resin citrus with a slight caramel malt backbone feel - full body with a lighter carb slight creamy overall - almost like a cross between a west coast and an east coast
6523,Ephraim,4.5,while boneyard notorious is still my favorite traditional / west coast stylized triple ipa this is quite enjoyable - dank a touch fruity big in hoppy bite and some ethanol yet still pretty smooth. dig!
6524,Ephraim,4.5,12oz can from hf. hazy golden pour fine white foamy head. piney hoppy aroma citrus peel. taste is oranges citrus peel light caramel malts. very smooth juicy lingering bitter finish. sublime.
6525,Ephraim,4.25,canned on 5/25/22; consumed on 6/14/22  pours a hazy largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap a slim frothy collar and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.  aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront leaving crackery malt lingering into soft grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time.  taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish.  mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish.  a warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean hill ipa profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base.
6526,Molson Golden,4,poor?! i would beat you as easily as rick moranis. molson golson mofos!!
6527,Molson Golden,1.94,i havent had this beer in over 25 years and now i know why. starts with a sourfunky aroma. taste follows the aroma but is somewhat muted(thankfully). i know my tastes have changed but i couldnt find much to like about this beer.
6528,Molson Golden,2.04,when i first started drinking beer it was busch miller and shlitz…. then i tried molson golden. that’s all my friends and i drank now fast forward 40 years it’s okay i don’t hate it i just out grew it.
6529,Molson Golden,2.04,ehhh. it says on the bottle “specially brewed for the unique flavor of an ale and a lager.” problem is its a weak ale and weaker lager. this could be okay if it wasn’t so watered down.
6530,Molson Golden,3,molson golden lager 5% - clear straw gold color with a frothy white cap of foam solid lager aroma and taste with mild corn grains and hops. better than most! cheers!
6531,Molson Golden,3.23,molson coors canada molson golden 12 fl. oz. green glass bottle coded sep2622 13 61020040408. sampled on may1222. $12.99/12-pk @ total wine & more cherry hill nj  notes via stream of consciousness: its poured a gold to deep golden body beneath a fingers width of white foam. the aroma is sweetish and just lightly grainy; its obvious that this is an adjunct beer. the hops are as expected: light non-specific and in the background. the flavor follows pretty closely. its lightly sweet and threaded through with delicately spicy and herbal hop notes. theres also a delicate apple-like fruitiness to it. as far as bitterness goes theres just enough to balance it and it teeters on becoming sweet. it finishes with a drop of sweet malt and apple lingering and then some emerging hops as the malt erodes. the head dropped fairly quickly althought plenty of fine bubbles can be seen rising steadily below. id say thats about average and the lacing follows suit. in the mouth its medium-light in body and gently crisp. all in all its not bad for what it is. review #7961
6532,Molson Golden,3.28,molson golden is perfect beer before oktoberfest. from when it gets hot in n. hemisphere around memorial day to labor day this beer quenches your thirst leaves a nice crisp up front flavor then a corn and hop finish. drink this ice cold in july and august. but when september rolls around it is change to another beer. at middle of september i stock up on oktoberfests since they are best and seasonal. granted you can get molson golden all year round and i did get a case of this in winter but this is a summer beer. i wish golden was a 5.5 or 5.7 at only 5%abv it is on par with labatt blue granted different flavors. this is a typical adjunct lager that is designed to be consumed with speed. this beer reminds me of fishing on 1000 islands in a boat which is illegal in canada. good times. i say 3.25 overall but certainly not poor this is a good beer and deserves respect for being a good macro. i know the men with man buns would argue that ipas are better blah blah blah but for an import and being a beginner beer for the 16 to 20 crowd down the tracks or in the woods this is a tasty beer. i guess the use of corn makes it cheap too but for a adjunct lager this is what is expected.
6533,Molson Golden,3.6,drank ridiculous quantities of this in college in rochester. molson dominated there. we used to fill the bed of a pickup truck for bottle returns weekly. while fond memories and nostalgia drive a likely higher-than-deserved rating i do believe this still tastes okay and quenches the thirst on a hot summer day.
6534,Molson Golden,2.46,i cannot believe ive never reviewed this old time classic. this beer was once regarded as the high end of imports my dad and older friends really thought there was something extra special about canadian imports...maybe there was circa. 1993?? i dont know but it really did seem exotic to be when i was 16.  soo here we go..... it couldnt be more clear gold. watery pale gold. thin scattered white foam lace.  sweet corn and green hop with sour yesstie aroma all over.  subtle clean...easy feel like water but with fermented canned corn and wheat. crisp bite then smooth with a green corn wheat and long malty flavor. subtle easy mundane.  its a $7.00 6 pack bro!
6535,Molson Golden,3.3,molson beer in canada is better and different than what gets sent to the usa. its a bit more hoppy crisp and very fresh tasting with a some more bite than the us version. even in the 1980s i had long neck bottles in montreal and i enjoyed the light taste of molson.
6536,Molson Golden,3.27,poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is straw transparent head is off white and presents with less than 1 fingers worth of head then dissipates to nothing but a ring along the glass.  smell is sweet corn adjunct and a nice grassy hop kick.  taste is adjunct basic macro lager some corn limited hop character.  mouthfeel is high carbonation moderate sweetness low bitterness but sharp carbonic lingering bite.  overall a decent macro lager the sweet corn/grassy hop kick is enticing and the adjuncts are not awful.
6537,Molson Golden,2.26,poured a clear pale yellow with a half - finger white fizzy head that disappeared in seconds. there is very little visible carbonation. this bottle is without a nose. taste of slight corn sweetness with a tiny hop finish. moderately full body with light carbonation. very disappointed in this beer which i have not had in over 30 years and i use to like. i remember mg had a lot more flavor head and aroma. this is not worth the calories.
6538,Molson Golden,3,12oz green twist-off bottle stamped sep2721 poured into a vintage bowtie glass at fridge temp no abv listed on label. the beer pours bright light straw yellow with nearly white head. the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles. the aroma is faint with slightly sweet grain and corn. the taste is semisweet & barely tart with minimal bitterness and noticeable diacetyl. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. overall poor. not clean with no noticeable malt character. label says this is made in golden co assuming by coors.
6539,Labatt Max Ice,4.57,sunday afternoon november 2022  on a cold rainy day its time for some ice beer. poured aggressively into tall cylindrical pint glass ice cold from a frosty tall boy can. a very sleek industrial look to the can; with a name like maximum ice we could be talkng about close to anything here. maximum ice poured aggressively into a tall cylindrical pint glass. this lager beer is an aureate bronze with subdued carbonation from the pouring style. atop the brew sits a sticky service envelope white head with big bubbles from the sugar used. it dissipates slowly and laces the glass well. its a nice looking cold beer. under the honker; aromas of wet brown bread fresh sourdough white salt crackers and a pinch of honey. the malt and bittering galena hops hit and create a pleasent fresh aroma; similar to a walk in refidgerator. maximum ice tastes of light caramel english biscuits and a touch of table sugar. the hops bitter the beer and add some astringency and needed dryness. a highly drinkable lager beer of the ice beer family. maximum ice has a refreshing and warming collection of light candied malts and well hidden alcohol. its a nice beer. as we huddle in; its a solid representitive of its style. i can certainly see this ice beer pairing well with some ball park hot dogs or a huge bag of potato chips.
6540,Labatt Max Ice,2.66,got this in a 24oz can and it was in a cooler at the bottom of all the ice. drank it directly from the can but poured some into a glass first. not so bad iced cold. definitely quenches the thirst or to have with burgers or hot dogs.
6541,Labatt Max Ice,3,i love when pompous beer people rate cheap swill in depth always good for a laugh. now dont get me wrong i love beer and i love drinking top quality brews but theres nothing wrong with slamming cheap strong beer and catching a buzz with your buds. looks like bubbly piss stinks like green apple taste like nickels in sugar water but will do the trick and fast. tastes like nothing after 3 of them anyway. drink up and have a good time.
6542,Labatt Max Ice,3.62,poured from a 24oz can into a forager pint glass. pours a standard deep gold with a frothy white head. strong corn or grain on the nose. drinks heavy which at 8% is certainly expected but this is a hearty lager for sure. price to abv though it’s hard to beat this one.
6543,Labatt Max Ice,1.57,this one poured very bubbly and fizzy at first and then settled immediately into pond water. the color is a weak and tepid clear straw yellow. theres a lot of lacing.  this smells horrid - wet stale leaves old bread metal solvent and green apple.  this is absolutely disgusting and not even worth the $1.99 it cost. its just super stale vegetal and weirdly sweet and bitter all at the same and in all the wrong places. it definitely tastes like it brewed inside of an old work boot and left to ferment in the death valley sun.  this is not drinkable not even in the least with a weird stale fruity bite on the back end.  this is disgusting and should be drank by absolutely nobody.
6544,Labatt Max Ice,1.46,well ill first say that i had this at a quite warm temperature so i admit that its certainly warmer than ideal however i drink a lot of beer at rather warm temperatures though and they still can get good ratings.  anyway the smell was like a cheap beer: weak standard beer smell mixed with a bit of damp socks and/or urine. i suppse some corn too which is maybe a bit different depending on what you think a typical cheap beer smells like.  the pour was very bubbly with a huge head that dissipated extremely quickly and eventually left no head nor lacing at all after some sips not even around the edges of the glass. (temperature could play a factor in this but still i dont think ive ever seen a beer that this has happened with)  the color was typical yellow like pee with big bubbles everywhere like fresh carbonated soda.  the mouthfeel was rather hollow. it had very prickly carbonation like a fresh carbonated soda but it didnt maintain its power/foam with some swishes.  taste was metallic (very strong metallic taste) watery (i guess a lack of flavor) and otherwise just plain lacking or dare i say bad. while there was certainly some hops in here it wasn\t especially noticeable nor was it a kind that tasted particularly good nor interesting in any way to me (just kind of generic bitterness/hopiness?). there wasn\t much of maltiness taste to me either or at least there was a lack of complexity/body to any maltiness that was there. i did quite easily notice multiple times a bit of corn. if you\ve ever been to a brewery/distillery that uses corn fermentation you should know what i mean but i suppose even eating fresh corn might give a bit of a similar taste. while senses can sometimes be deceiving/wrong i believe that this beer must have been fortified with a corn-based low-filtration alcohol otherwise i don\t know why i\d be tasting any corn in this. am i crazy to say this? i don\t know if that\s something that\s ever done. heck maybe it\s a beer made mostly/exclusively from corn? is that possible? because that\s kind of what it tastes like.  i poured it from a 473 ml can (and also drank most straight from the can) which some might say contributed to the metallic taste but i don\t believe in that sort of thing. i don\t find that cans affect the flavor in any sort of significant way; especially not to this extent. the last beer i had as a draft from a bar and it tasted very metallic and bad like this as well which is an interesting coincidence (it might have been labatt beer even for all i know as it was just the house draft). i think the metallic taste is due to the carbonation (carbonic acid) and not being masked enough by any other flavors. another way to describe it would perhaps be like a mild sodium bicarbonate solution or club soda. mix a bit of really cheap low-filtered/unfiltered corn vodka with some club soda and you\d probably be getting close to the taste of what i\m predominately feeling here. obviously that\s a bit of an exaggeration though.   unsurprisingly the 7% abv isn\t well hidden as it\s an extremely prominent flavor as well. i do like that it has high abv though as i\ve found that i generally do like beers that have higher abv which is why i thought i\d give this a shot. however while it is a low price point for relatively high alcohol content my go-to cheap high-abv beer is miles away better than this. faxe strong. at least where i live (canada) faxe is essentially the same price per ml as this right around the bottom of what i think the minimum legal price is considering the abv— or at least around the minimum of what\s commercially viable in the country as well considering that they\re individually canned and individually sold (although i suppose some are sold in packs as well). i wasn\t expecting anything from faxe strong but i was actually surprised at it being very good. it\s one of my favorite reasonably-price high abv-beers right under most of the stuff that unibroue produces (although unibroue comes at a higher price point still well-priced)  because of how much i disliked it or rather how i disliked pretty much every aspect of it im not sure how to even rate this. all i can say is that its probably worse than anything commercial that ive had before and is right around the bottom just probably not worst possible. im sure its possible to scrape lower without getting into non-commercial or spoiled/skunked beers.  i don\t know if this is a pro or a con but i got to enjoy the beer over a long period of time due to it not being in any way delicious.  so really anywhere between a 1 and a 1.75 (out of 5) seems reasonable to me. the main thing that you take from this is that in most citiess there should be no reason to buy this when there are better alternatives (at least at other stores)
6545,Labatt Max Ice,3.53,24 ounce can into lager glass canned on 4/20/2018. pours crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. aromas of cracker corn white bread dough toasted biscuit light honey/nuttiness and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. a bit of fruity/metallic aromas but not overwhelming; mostly went away as it warmed. nice an pleasant aromas with bready malt corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. taste of cracker corn white bread dough toasted biscuit light honey/nuttiness and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. very mild herbal grassy spicy bitterness on the finish. lingering notes of cracker corn white bread dough toasted biscuit light honey/nuttiness and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. nice robustness of bready malt corn and mild earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. very clean on lager flavors with minimal fruity notes present. lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a smooth creamy/bready/grainy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. increasingly warming 8% alcohol but not too rough of a finish. overall this is a pretty good iced malt liquor. all around good robustness of bready malt corn and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the abv; with the mildly bitter/boozy finish. clean and rich barely/grain flavors with mild earthy hop balance. not overdone on the corn adjuncts. a nicely enjoyable and well made style example.
6546,Labatt Max Ice,2.01,1/13/18: 24 oz can purchased at shop & save market $1.49 w/ tax. poured a 24 ounce can over two pours canned on 11/7/17 into a large flute. beer is 8.0% abv not the 7.1% listed above. pour clear yellow soapy cloudy white head which lasted a while. nominal corn aroma and taste mild carbonation very thin mouth feel. alcohol hidden until you consume the can very light drinking due to the light taste and thin texture.
6547,Labatt Max Ice,1.55,im sure beer gets worse than this but im blessed that i have only had one that would fall to those murky depths. this is in the bottom 2 worst beers ive ever had and its cutting it close. this stuff is awful dont buy this.  l - looks kinda off-putting. a yellow over carbonated pour with some soapy head. resembles something between fresh urine and mop bucket water. but its hard to actually fuck this up and it has a head so although its not a pretty sight its not as much of a warning sign as it should be.  s - its the usual for a beer to rank poorly here because it has no discernible scent characteristics. its not as usual for it to rank poorly because it actually smells unpleasant. this beer has its standard malty and corny smell but intertwined with a chemical aroma that just doesnt belong there. it keeps reminding me of cleaner for some reason.  t - i could give the actual account of taste which is chemical doused corn and alcohol and not much else. but really the way id honestly describe it is like drinking regularly bad mass-produced beer by pouring it on a shirt youve worn for a long time and wringing it out. its oddly accurate to what youd imagine and just as off putting as it should be. aftertaste lingers for too long and is a haunting reminder of what just happened.  f - admittedly the mouthfeel is not horrific. its actually kinda average. not that light little too carbonated smooth enough and goes down even if the entire trip is unpleasant. but its not worth it.  o - if youre not a broke alcoholic you can be doing better. hell even if you are a broke alcoholic you probably can still do better. i refuse to believe that there isnt better options than this. such as drinking antifreeze or huffing your own excrement.
6548,Labatt Max Ice,1.25,this is just plain awful it pours a golden color with a thick white head i put it in the freezer for a half hour. it leaves little in the way of lacing. there is nothing good here.
6549,Very GGGreennn,4.78,a: murky creamy orange color with a 1/2 finger off-white head that fades pretty quickly.  s: orange and mango sorbet. sweet melon and caramelized orange zest. sweet lemons and some creamy peach notes. crackers and guava. strawberry kiwi and passionfruit. some faint sharp pineapple more citrus crackers at the end. juicy aroma  t: juicy oranges clementines and apricots upfront. behind that is creamy mango and sweet pineapple juice followed by a kiss of grapefruit bitterness. some of that crackery note im picking up in the taste as well. guava and loads of sweet melon. creamsicle ice cream and a hint of resin  m: fluffy creamy medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation  o: high ratings are absolutely warranted on this. amazing beer. fantastic example of what this style of beer should be. not one flaw. delicious smooth and balanced
6550,Very GGGreennn,4.25,pours a perfect hazy orange-yellow color very dense perfect foamy head. loads or orange citrus in the nose. flavor is waves of citrus. very sharp hop bite despite being a month old. very juicy with a lasting hop bitterness but not a west coast bitterness. just an overly hopped bitterness. perfect carbonation creates a creamy texture. overall a very good dipa a little to bitter for me.  8/1/23 16 oz can dated 6/29/23 4.25 rating
6551,Very GGGreennn,4.74,from a three-week-old can stamped this beer goes to 11 pours a densely hazy deep yellow-gold. big white head leaves thick lacing. smell hits while pouring: pineapple citrus and resinous herbs. taste follows fruity and resinous with a decent hit of bitterness in the finish. this is a huge beer and massively enjoyable.
6552,Very GGGreennn,4.32,pours a pale translucent yellow; dirty yellow and cloudy in the glass; thick head; off-white dense and spongy; semi-creamy texture; spidery fingers and webs of foam cling to the glass. somewhat weak nose; green herbs soft biscuit; indeterminate earthy esters. smooth grainy taste with a sublime bitter undercurrent; mild oat; zesty hop bitterness; very low-key earthy fruitiness subliminal pineapple and grapefruit. heavy body; smooth and velvety; semi-juicy; light to moderate dryness component.  billed as an american double ipa on the label this beer is nowhere near as intense in flavor or feel like so many others. instead there is a respectable balance and nuance at work. the drinkability of the beer if pretty phenomenal. there is nothing harsh or brash about the taste or mouthfeel just glorious smooth and tasty vibes of the hazy-persuasion.  pouring temperature: 45 °f; canning info: very gggood 05/05/23 source: @tasterschoice62
6553,Very GGGreennn,4.54,canned 3/09/23  i kinda picked some stuff at random when placing an order recently. i had no idea this was so highly rated. not sure about #22 overall but its same good. dank for days with a wonderfully over the top explosion of tropical fruit. hell yeah.
6554,Very GGGreennn,4.67,look - thick hazy milky tannish orange with a white head and fantastic rimming and lacing smell - tropical pineapple mango orange with a slight dankness taste - tropical pineapple mange orange like the scent along with tank green dankness feel - creamy medium full body with a medium light carb overall - really fantatasic tropical ne haze
6555,Troegenator,3.8,malty background yes but not overwhelmingly so. forward sweetness. not recommended on an empty stomach.
6556,Troegenator,3.9,12oz bottle best by 8.21.23  poured at fridge temp into a tulip glass  pours a deep coppery brown (and crystal clear clarity) with a 2 finger tan head. quickly settled into a fair ring and loose cap. 4  off the bottle i get lots of dark but fresh/ripe stonefruit mostly plum fig but also something brighter and sweeter... dates maybe? whatever it is its awesome! 4  chocolate malt is clear and gentle deep ripe plum and toasted grain. slight alcohol warmth but its barely perceptible. 3.75  full and chewy body but not syrupy or too thick. carbo is moderate and lingering grain + stonefruit is great. 4  overall a delightful and well rounded/crafted beer enjoyable warm or cold. 4
6557,Troegenator,3.94,tastes like a classic double bock. but is flat and should have much more foam and carbonization.  there are better out there.
6558,Troegenator,4.11,drank 2 for this rating one warmed for a few minutes and one straight from the fridge  pours somewhere between copper and amber slightly hazy with a quickly dissipating 3.5 finger khaki head  smells upfront mildly of hops and definitely of malt maybe a tiny bit of lemon?  tastes very sweet initially followed by caramel with an aftertaste of dried fruit with very little bitterness throughout. i notice more bitterness the more i drink but it still remains very low. i still taste the caramel notes. during the second bottle i began tasting toast and bread very good malt tastes in this beer.  this is extremely smooth likely the smoothest non stout/porter ive had  absolutely willing to buy this again as a 6 pack which is how i bought this to celebrate german beer day. price was decent so thats another thing in its favor
6559,Troegenator,4.17,dark brown with a bready aroma. taste hints of caramel pumpernickel. good balance as it warms.
6560,Troegenator,3.5,pours a deep amber. no foam. stone fruit aroma. sour fruit body. nutty finish. tastes like a fruitcake. not really my style.
6561,Troegenator,4.18,awesome beer for the winter season although i have easily enjoyed one (or two) during summer. i prefer ipa’s but this is a really good double bock. very rich and heavy. not for amateurs ;0)
6562,Troegenator,4.25,freshest by 3/29/23; drank 12/23/22 @ pokemon communion.  semi-opaque brown/purple appearance.  nice khaki head; decent lace.  plum caramel & leather notes in the nose.  medium thick mouthfeel.  plum leather & caramel flavors up front; mild booze heat & faint banana notes on the finish.  sweet but easy drink & quite enjoyable.
6563,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,amazing stout expensive but worth the price!
6564,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,this beer meet and exceeded all the unreal hype. it is simply amazing!
6565,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,let it sit and warm to the room a little ... unbelievable.
6566,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.67,a small pour ebony dark no real head. intense rich aroma brownies and german chocolate cake; dark sweetness. the taste amplifies the smell with the addition of sublime kentucky bourbon. heavy body; dense chewy residual sugar feel with a sublime whiskey heat.  this beauty was generously provided by @azuelke (adam) at a bottle share hosted by @greenbayba in sheboygan wi. there were many great beers sample many beautiful and exquisite dark beers but nothing quite like this legendary beer. if ever you have a chance to try this one all i can say is dont pass it up. the beer lives up to its legendary status.  pouring temperature: n/a; bottling info: unknown year bottle number #138 source: @azuelke (adam) sheboygan wi bottle share
6567,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,vintage 2022 served on tap at toppling goliath in a snulip glass. opaque deep blackish brown in color with garnet highlights and a wisp of tan head. where to start? notes of cocoa molasses licorice cherry cola and maple syrup. the bourbon/barrel was surprisingly quite understated. full body almost syrupy with good carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. this finishes cleanly with hints of roasted malt maple syrup and molasses lingering on the finish. this was incredibly easy drinking and not at all boozy despite the high abv and it was so good that i wanted to lick the glass clean. world class all the way.
6568,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.5,tastes like a malted milk ball candy. so yummy.
6569,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.24,12 oz bottle into a dimple mug. l: pours black with a creamy 1/4 light tan head low carbonation good head retention light scattered patchy lacing. s: dark chocolate fudge dark roasted grains black bread distant raisins & dates. t: sweet dark chocolate toasted dark caramelized malts a hint of char background raisins dates & prunes a very mild and distant suggestion of mineral taste. it is gently bitter in the finish which lingers a bit. f: smooth and lightly creamy medium-bodied feel with a lightly fluffy center and a gently dry medium-length finish. o: aroma and taste are nearly identical. it is a bit sweet and is dominated by chocolate. pleasant drinking and lightly dry. it is outstanding in its style.
6570,Organic Chocolate Stout,3.84,lumpy two-finger head which settles to a film of bubbles. plenty of wider streaks as the beer is consumed. dark brown color with no light passing.  the smell is of freshly opened semisweet chocolate nibs. minor chalk.  sweet cocoa flavor. above average body creamy on the initial sip but a bit watery in the swallow. odd. the carbonation is a bit on the low side. this stout has no burnt bitterness. might be better described as a chocolate porter. the semisweet chocolate is the flavor all the way through the moderate aftertaste. candy-like and a one-trick pony.
6571,Organic Chocolate Stout,3.9,pours black with a vigorous head. aroma is light chocolate malt. taste is light in body creamy sweet and a light milk chocolate flavor. abv is quite light. altogether quite respectable.
6572,Organic Chocolate Stout,4,pours black. 1-finger brown head that quickly moves to being a collar.  aroma of malt chocolate burnt marshmallow fig.  taste is very sweet marshmallow caramel brown sugar and fudge.  mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently cleansing.  overall nice. drinkable. sessionable. worth a try.
6573,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.37,from a bottle. pours a nice black colour with a thin head that sits nicely. smell is faintly alcohol; taste is amazing. chocolate malt is predominant with a very slightly bitter finish.
6574,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.77,16 oz. can moderately chilled. color is burnt umber with a tan head. the feel is thin but silky smooth. the cocoa is prominent without coming across as sweet allowing the malt roast to come through. very well-balanced and one of the most perfect beers ive ever had.
6575,Organic Chocolate Stout,5,this is a 5-star stout...  the aroma doesnt knock you over with hops or alcohol. the flavor is complete and doesnt become overwhelming or loose its punch as the glass is drained. it has a good ritch mouth-feel that is not biting and is more smooth than chewy (though it is definitely a stout you can chew).  it pairs well with artisan pizza chicken alfredo grilled chicken and it stands alone very well on a cool night under the stars or by the campfire.  it is a filet-minoin or dessert stout... something to savor not a quaffable daily driver.
6576,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.5,pours dark. tan foam. chocolate aroma. rich milk chocolate body. sweet but not too sweet. creamy smooth. light bitter finish. delicious.
6577,The Broken Truck,4.47,pours golden with frothy soap off white head. mustyness and wash rind cheese with a touch of apple flesh on the nose. the first thing that stands out is that this is soft - it doesnt have any commandeering characteristics that detract from the others. i get some apple some arugula bitterness with restrained acidity. maybe some musty sour cherry too kinda like what you get in a kriek but very much more subtle. this is an excellent excellent spon beer. one of the best beers of this variety ive had in some time.
6578,The Broken Truck,4.63,man if i had to put potentially the best beers of 2022 against each other it might be this and that gueuze from new glarus. whooo boy some gooduns. this is the 22 bottle.  pours yellow out on the river. summer winding down lets finish it up. hits some amazing funky sour spontaneous notes. and they said it couldnt be done on this side of the pond. just a delight to smell. the best of what tilamook has to offer. boasts fresh french oak feels bugs grapefruit lemon rind bleu cheese green apple yogurt. the gangs all here.  the taste was such a nice thing great bottle on one of those awesome yet sad close to summer beers. made it memorable. its vibrant fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer. one of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer. sawft body too never felt too acidic or sour. this is honestly better than most belgian gueuzes. i realize given the demographics of beer nerds theyre going to keep fetishizing western europe but ill be more than happy to take any of these wisconsin and oregon gems off your hands.
6579,The Broken Truck,4.29,opened up no. 6 (1/20) 7 (1/21) and 8 (1/22) together and tasted side-by-side.  all three boasted a beautiful golden yellow on the pour with frothy aromatic head that was slow to settle into the body of the beer.  no.6 brought notes of lemon zest oak and white grape must on a sweet musty backbone. no. 7 came on sweeter with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less brett character. the oak component had more of a freshly cut aroma to it and preceded notes of bleu cheese that i didn\t get on no.6. no.8 was probably the most distinctly unique; white wine like with 7 but more of a grapefruit-specific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet & funky.  the palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel. the oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill however while no.8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness 7 & 8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness. no. 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness.  light-bodied dry and lightly bitter mouthfeel to all three. as mentioned varying levels of tartness / acid but all very soft in their carbonation and smooth in the finish.  overall im honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was. each had their own unique nuances but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both characterizing a predominance of fresh oak brett bitter citrus drying tannin and a noticeable albeit subtle funky/cheesy quality on the backbone. definitely fun to have these all side-by-side.
6580,The Broken Truck,4.5,og batch 1 broken truck. classic de garde taste similar in quality to all of the bu beers that were bottled during the brewery\s infancy. it lacks the nuance of trevors newer offerings; minimal funk lesser barrel treatment aggressively sour. overall a legendary beer whose story was greater than its contents.
6581,The Broken Truck,4.56,appearance - the beer from a double sealed bottle poured a golden color with an aggressively bubbled white head.  smell - the brett character came out in the nose with a degree of bitterness.  taste - grass green apples and a brett character that really stands out. the finish had a bitter earthy quality. it was not particularly sour but it definitely brought the funk.  mouthfeel - the carbonation was aggressive quickly sweeping away any sweetness.  overall - no fruits or adjuncts are needed. this was great.
6582,The Broken Truck,4.9,#103 good stuff!
6583,Damnation,4.03,look: it pours yellow and quite clear with a pillow like white head. it has excellent head retention.  smell: there is pronounced grainy malts in the aroma. it has some light spices in the nose with a touch of pear.  taste: there are some belgian funk elements with malty grain. there are some spicy elements with light banana and pear.  feel: it has a medium body with an easy drinking finish.  overall the balance between flavors is quite good but the aroma is lighter than i like.
6584,Damnation,4.13,serving: 375 ml bottle (“bottled on 111722”) poured into a 14 oz teku glass.  appearance: deep golden yellow with increasing haze as the bottle pours and a rocky thick head of white foam.  smell: grassy fruity pale malt and yeasty phenolic cloves and spice.  taste: more cloves pepper fruity but dry malt body.  mouthfeel: medium body and crisp carbonation.  overall: a solid belgian-style golden ale with nice balance of malt hops and spicy funky yeast.
6585,Damnation,4.27,review 1608 damnation russian river brewing date: 08 may 2020 drinking through one of the lists on beeradovcate this beer is next on the docket. i served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees. the pour created a massive two-fingered creamy but airy white head. the retention is excellent leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. the color charts around srm 8 dark golden yellow with amber hues. the clarity is clear with loads of carbonation. a beautiful appearance.  the aromas in the beer are cloves phenols floral toasted crackers banana a touch of funk and earthiness.  i taste cloves phenols floral herbal green grass toasted crackers bready a hint of funk orange banana and earthiness.  the mouthfeel is dry and spicy.  the body is medium has high carbonation and has a lasting finish.  i was expecting a big malty and spicy belgium beer. i got a lighter malty belgium beer with a dry spicy finish. a unique take on this style. i enjoyed the differences in this beer.
6586,Damnation,3.96,bottled 5/27/20.
6587,Damnation,3.03,i should issue a caveat. the bottle shop had this labeled as a russian imperial stout. you stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment. it is not that this beer is bad. looks smells tastes and feels like a belgian. not a particularly good one so i’m surprised by the ratings. it’s spicy banana belgian blah blah boredom all day long. almost as if someone said “let’s brew a prototypical belgian.” and strong ale? at 7.5%? i have had abbey ales at 10%+ with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors. those are belgian strong ales. duvel though decidedly weaker than some is light years beyond this. the temerity!
6588,Damnation,4.23,inspired by duvel in style damnation exudes the sonoma terroir: winey yet wonderfully dry. the yeast reminds me of belgiums passionate pints particularly how the yeast works up the malts. and a dash of pepper. spritzy.  because russian river produces mostly world-class wilds (and i shy from the style) i am glad to see their excellence applied to the bspa. preceded by two bay area cheeses damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and italian parsley.
6589,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.42,500ml bottle marked l.33170 poured into a nonic pint glass at fridge temp 15% abv. the beer pours a little more than hefe-hazy in a dull amber. the head isnt much but the pencil thin ring and island did hang in for a minute. minimal lacing. the aroma is mild vaguely sweet with some orchard fruit and hints of rotten grain. the taste is sticky sweet with some caramel and more apple/pear and tongue numbing ethanol. negligible bitterness. the mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a decidedly undry finish. overall a middling high abv malt liquor a lithuanian tick and nothing that could ever resemble an imperial pils...
6590,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.63,clear dark amber with a small ivory head that vanishes in a blink. the aroma is sweet caramel malt and hints of cheap whiskey or rum some grassy notes. the taste is also sweet caramel malt and brown sugar or molasses with rum plenty of alcohol taste and burn. the finish is still sticky sweet with rum notes and just a hint of grassy hops. the body is full and a bit oily light carbonation. altogether my first problem is rating this as any kind of pilsner it just does not resemble any pilsner i\ve ever had. it is more like an extra strength barleywine or maybe a boilermaker. whatever it is it is drinkable and packs a pretty good punch for the price. if that\s what you are looking for this is for you.
6591,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.75,i am not sure what i was thinking when i bought this beer. upon reflection i feel like a teenage boy who is trying to get away with something and gets terribly embarrassed.  anyway...i poured this beer from a bottle into a tulip glass. dark yellow essentially no head or lacing. strong booze smell and taste sort of cheep whisky. it does have some smokiness that does not make it a total loss and it is warming. not a repeater.
6592,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.25,boozy
6593,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.43,this beer is hilarious honestly not sure what this is looks like piss tastes like a heavy lager smells like bready malt and booze feels like a eastern bloc boot stomp yikes. it’s decent but man the mixed reviews on this have me laughing my ass off
6594,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.15,as a homebrewer im familiar with the style. very on par for a mr. beer extract kit that the owner boosted with a sugary adjunct such as honey or way too much sugar. tastes acrid sharp & bitter like most brews from this hovel of a brewery. i tried their lobster lovers beer & it was identical. drinks like what youd expect a soviet bloc country brewing adjunct beers & selling at craft prices to taste like. the bottom shelf at my local gas station would all drink smoother than this slav piss.
6595,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.71,500ml bottle. poured out a clear golden amber color with a very small white head of foam. it smelled of boozy sweet malt. so much alcohol burn. little bitterness.
6596,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,5,here is a brew ive been cellaring for quite a while as i feared it would taste rancid based on reviews of this site. let me tell you maybe the bad reviews are due to drinking this too fresh or in the wrong glass or the wrong temperature or improper storage i dont know. but i am drinking a bottle right now that has aged gracefully for 14 years and reminds me of nothing more than j.w. lees barley wine the only thing missing is some time in the barrel.  poured at about 44 degrees into a snifter this beer has an appearance of opaque orangish rustic brown with minimal head. the aroma is of sweet hints of subtle wet cardboard and wet basement yet has some bourbon caramel vanilla fruity woodness mixed in. the flavors are very much of the aroma with some hints of tobacco. im telling you if i didnt see the bottle i would have thought it was a j.w. lee vintage. for $3 this beer kicks ass! it might just need to age and be stored properly. this is for sure the best lithuanian beer i have ever had. i give it a 5 because well i see nothing wrong with it and if i see it again ill be sure be buying it again. think about it j.w. lees is $10 for 11.2 oz and this is $3 for 22oz.
6597,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,3.23,rinkuškiai crazy brewski imperial pils 16.9 fl. oz. brown glass bottle coded l.13021 $2.99 @ roger wilco pennsauken nj  notes via stream of consciousness: cool label. i\m not sure what the santa hat is doing on a guy who looks kind of like the devil but ok. and what is naturally fermented beer? is there an un-natural way of fermenting beer? i have not heard of that yet but i digress. it pours a clear amber-orange body beneath a short head of bright white that is fizzling away before my eyes. at 15% alcohol though i guess that a little of that is expected. ahhh wait although it\s clear not quite fingerprint-through-the-glass clear but clear the bottle says it\s partially filtered bottle-conditioned and maybe that\s what they mean by naturally fermented beer. unfortunately partially filtered is not the same thing as bottle-conditioned and i highly doubt you\d get much additional carbonation at 14+% alcohol unless you had a really tolerant yeast strain but ok here i go getting off-track again back to the beer. there\s some higher alcohol and ethyl acetate in the aroma. not good. there\s some adjunct laden and bready & caramelish malt as well but the nail polish aroma is distracting - big loss of points on that count. of course to be honest i was kind of expecting that. this isn\t from russia it\s from lithuania but that\s close enough and i\ve found a lot of the beers from the baltic region with higher gravities and alcohol contents suffer from hot and fast fermentations. personally i believe that they actually like this over there but different strokes for different folks right? at least it doesn\t taste like anti-freeze was added that\s pretty much soley a russian thing. moving forward and if you think i was kidding i wasn\t the flavor reflects those higher alcohols and ethyl acetate as well. it\s not the worst i\ve ever had but it\s still not good. i\m only a couple of sips into this and i\m not sure i want to finish it. i fear i might black out or maybe do something weird if i get drunk on it. it\s malty though and at least i like that; and it\s balanced by a low-level bitterness and the hot alcohol which equals a dry finish. there are unfortunately no noticeable hops. perhaps some leafy grassy and spicy undertones are there but that\s it. no this is more like the malt prior to distilling bourbon. given that it\s flawed it\s hard to score it well but at the same time i have had worse so it is what it is and it gets what it gets. medium-full in body with a dextrinous side and a moderate soft carbonation that leaves it smooth and doesn\t amplify the alcohol or heat that\s there. not the best by any means but certainly not undrinkable.
6598,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,5,the look is that of a samuel adams boston lager. the smell and taste is basically the same. decent beer that has been sitting in a rusty bucket it even slightly stings. the feel!!!! this is where this beer shines. when you consider the alcohol content it is so light and easy to drink. it has the alcohol of four beers and comes in 16.6oz bottles! it doesnt taste like one of those iced beers its not thick it wont make you puke if you chug it(which has happened to me with king cobra and natty daddy). if you put a little thought and calculate the amount of alcohol in this drink the taste and feel are far better than anything else in the range. i will definitely buy again.
6599,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.06,this was so disgusting i didnt know how to describe it. it pours decent but the smell is overwhelmingly terrible. it wreaks of stale disgusting bourbon mixed with a even more stale and disgusting beer thats mixed with a stronger taste of alcohol than everclear. just dont do it. stay away from it.
6600,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.57,this is an amber colored brew...slim head and a medium clear complexion. the aroma is boozy with an off-putting caramel scent. strong alcoholic sweet and ill-conceived. its like a sweet alcoholic excuse for a beer. not at all reminiscent of a pilsener. disappointing.
6601,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.3,i received a single bottle of this lithuanian imperial pils as a gift from a friend and didn\t know what to expect. i\ve found some eastern european beers to be surprisingly good. poured from 16.9 oz. bottle into pilsner glass. it pours an orange-bronze color with a very thin ecru-colored head. it smells of sweet malt brown sugar caramel and dark fruit. the smell is vaguely reminiscent of a barleywine. the taste though is awful: cloyingly sweet with astringent alcohol; there\s nothing subtle about this . . . and nothing good either. it\s bereft of carbonation and the booziness is over the top. this may be the least pleasant beer i\ve had. don\t let the look and smell fool you; it\s simply dreadful stuff!
6602,Pannepot,3.82,11.2fl oz bottle served in wine glass 21/09/2021  this beer pours a deep brown hue and is topped with a couple inches of tan head that leaves nice lacing.  i smell raisin and brown sugar. i get some molasses too.  taste is it has a pumpernickel bread flavor but sweeter. i get a little fig and date. i get some caramelized sugar. earthy with some muted spices.  thin bodied with a thin mouthfeel  good beer

6609,Pannepot,4.05,a 330ml bottle 2020 vintage bottled on 14th july 2020 with a best before date of 14th july 2025. poured into a struise tulip glass.  appearance: dark brown in colour with a thin beige head that dissipated quickly and left only sparse to no lacing.  aroma: sweet doughy cake caramel clove candied plum prune grape gummy candies chocolate coffee and candi sugar.  taste: lightly sweet yeasty doughy slightly boozy fig clove plum prunes raisin toffee with notes of cocoa and chocolate.  mouthfeel: creamy medium bodied with low carbonation.  overall: a little bit too doughy for me but still enjoyable.
6610,Pannepot,4.3,july 30th 2016 - a wonderful treat here with a good friend and an aged beer that might have soon been eligible for a museum. complex deep and wonderful it bears a striking relationship with its cousin tasted and enjoyed back in october. the smell reminds me of yakitori stands on a cold winter tokyo night and made deep with a muddy rich aroma. the flavor is equally impressive and develops as a well trained orchestra with multitudinous tastes and notes acting in concert to a glorious crescendo.
6611,Pannepot,3.6,1300th review. something £ and exotic that rather missed its high expectations. l- black to the eye held to a halogen its a super-dark red-brown. pours with a 3mm fine-bubble pale tan head. s- quite bright and vinious... is this aged in wine barrels? ... t- it definitely has a fruity/wine side to it... then i start wondering just wine or wine plus a hint of brandy ie its quite a pungent/abv%-ey facet. f- it doesnt taste like a typical belgian quad the wine edge is prominent here. its all in pretty pungent one for slow sipping esp in winter/colder months. o- well its a tasty beer but for me the wine notes are a bit too prominent. the adage from my youth was enjoy the grape (wine/brandy) or the grain (beer/whisky etc) as never the two will meet. i.e. mix them => hang-over from hell. and that seems to be true. so beer tasting of wine is a bit strange for me. this beer is from a bottle labelled on the front pannepot - special - reserva in place of the 2006 - ale brewed with spices in the photo above. bottled: 24/04/2018. 330ml. bought from bacchanalia mill road cambridge/uk £6.99 - ouch!
6612,Pannepot,4.23,2017 bottle  pours dark brown tan colored head that fades. aroma of doughy bread caramel booze clove dried apricot. similar flavors in the taste starts a little sweet but finishes dry a little oaky and mild tartness. medium bodied.
6613,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.6,2022 version  pours out a very dark brown. on a straight pour very little foam is agitated out.  nose is oak roasted malt and a peppery quality. almost like rye spice. if i didnt know any better id say that this was a rye barrel aged stout. or perhaps even a rye based stout.  on the taste however there is more of a story. oak and bourbon come through first on the palate. behind that is the roasted malt bringing a dark bread note and a beautiful dark chocolate the sings throughout. i picture an overdone rugelach with a dark chocolate filling in my minds eye with this brew. the only sweetness being from what little is in the dough and the mildly sweetened chocolate. while the oak shows up quickly it dims down as the palate progresses and the more subtle flavors appear. like a tide retreating to show the rocks that sit beneath.  mouthfeel is fullbodied but not oily or cloying. it has heft but not the residue that often accompanies. there is drying for sure most likely due to abv and barrel tannins. the carbonation is considerable too for a stout at this percentage. mild compared to most anything else but surprising in this regard.  overall this is what i expected from alesmith. a respectful expert brew. the base brew is a hallmark; an example of how often less is more. the barrel aging brings it up a notch while still maintaining that level of composure and elegance. i had no doubt that this would be a world-class offering.
6614,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.84,2016 bottle aged for 7 years and cracking it on my last saturday night in my house in georgia
6615,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.45,12 ounce bottle into a snifter. bottled 4/18/22 had 6/15/22.  pours near black and opaque with a half inch foamy head and light foamy lacing. aromas of coffee bourbon roasted malt vanilla oak some chocolate light caramel and char. flavors of bourbon coffee roasted malt vanilla oak some chocolate light caramel. has a decent amount of hop bitterness. smooth a solid full body appropriately carbonated.  coffee and barrel for days. vibrant aromas and flavors with a bitterness that’ll leave a chip on your shoulder.
6616,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.73,absolutely amazing!
6617,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.65,l: motor oil jet black pour from a 12oz bottled chilled into a sniffer - lite foam risen tot he surface. looks really thick and oily from the appearance. s: big notes of chocolate not so much coffee in the nose but ive been surprised in the past by this with chocolatey aromas and big coffee tastes. smelling sweet dark cherries bourbon little bit of oak and vanilla. very on point with the exception of the coffee. t: coffee big upfront followed by the chocolate and bourbon/ dark cherry taste. getting the vanilla and oaky barrels here too. well done! f: medium to heavy bodied easy sipper for over 13%. not to chewy and surprisingly not to oily. o: this was a great stout to try! ill be buying again soon but definitely worth checking out!
6618,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,the beer pours a nice brown head that dissipates fairly quickly while the beer itself is a dark chocolate black with a nice glossy sheen to it.  the smell is absolutely delicious. the bourbon and coffee come out first and followed by a nice mild and soft vanilla alongside a bittersweet dark chocolate. there is a noticeable alcohol note that shines through but doesnt really hurt it that much.  the taste is phenomenal! it has the same notes as the smell with a few additions. the oak note is more present in the taste and lasts through the whole thing. the bitter coffee note comes out first and the bourbon doesnt show up until towards the finish alongside the chocolate. there is also no alcohol notes.  the feel is good. it has a very smooth body with a tingling feeling from the carbonation. it also packs quite a bit of heat for a barrel aged beer.  overall this is a delicious beer worth getting and holding for a bit because it definitely tastes like it can develop a bit more fully than it has right now.
6619,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,appearance: black small brown head that fades out after a minute. i can hear it fizzing like a coke.  smell: chocolate wood vanilla coconut nice aroma.  taste: big chocolate up front nice mild wood and vanilla then finishes with more chocolate. very smooth alcohol is well hidden. soft feel.  overall: ive been wanting some barrel-aged stouts as the weather is starting to turn colder. picked up a single of ba speedway stout. its been years since i had the non-ba version so cant really compare them. the ba was very tasty big chocolate flavor and well-integrated barrel. very good!
6620,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,2022 edition  pours jet black with no head. huge bourbon notes on the nose with dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla detectable.  the taste is massive to borrow a term from the beer’s description. i’m hit with dark fruits leather and tobacco right away while it finishes with a bourbon-y flourish. if there’s coffee to be had here it’s minimal to this palate.  this is a great beer nonetheless and really reminds me of bcbs.
6621,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,look - black thick slight tan head really great rimming and lacing smell - strong booze dark fruit woody roasted malt rich and slight black licorice taste - boozy barrel and woody vanilla roasted malt feel - full body slight bite low carb overall - classic ba stout
6622,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.29,aroma is of overripe banana bubblegum peach cobbler. the body is a sumptuous banana bread flavor with a great carbonated mouthfeel. sweet and thick. great!
6623,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.41,re-reviewing this one as i haven’t had it in ages.  500ml can (code l22091 14:06 / 010422 so maybe packaged 4/1/2022) into a weizen glass. pours a nutty brown color somewhere between iced tea and cola with a soft off-white head and steady carbonation.  aroma is fruity and bready not unlike a marzen. clove and spice ripe banana a hint of root beer.  taste follows nose. sweet bready malt yeasty esters fruit and spice.  mouthfeel is clean and crisp light to medium body. lively carbonation keeps this beer dancing on my palate. super drinkable.  overall a solid well-executed traditional beer that defines the style. ____________  previous review (9/16/2011) preserved for posterity:  4.45/5  rdev +2.8% look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 500ml bottle (code10.207 2 / 0393 2823) poured into a weizen glass. pours a beautiful hazy copper-brown color with a ridiculous off-white head and cascading carbonation. head condenses to a thick rocky pillow of foam that recedes slowly. big pockets of air develop within the massive head around the sides of the glass; frothy lacing forms in its wake. theres a bright amber glow where the light reflects up from the bottom of the glass then the beer gets darker as you reach the top. just a gorgeous beer to behold.  aroma is overripe bananas sweet malt clove and other spices. nice fruity floral aroma with a hint of yeast.  taste is a mouthful of spotty brown bananas sweet bready malt raisins yeast and spice. this is the definition of mellow. nice clean mouthfeel that leaves a pleasant sweet aftertaste. the high abv is hidden extremely well.  overall this is just a wonderful special beer. i would love to get this fresh on tap some day.
6624,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.43,dam why havent i known about this beer before? i tired a 10oz pour at grace in growlers and can understand the love for this beer. orange brown with a mild head. wheaty malty not too sweet. more please!
6625,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.76,when somethings this delicious i just dont care about by rdev rating-to-style etc. amazing sauce perfectly balanced incredible mix of wheat and sweet no booziness and a finish that makes me want more. i could drink this endlessly. simply superb.
6626,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.29,a dark red/brown color with a 1 beige head\ aroma of toffee dark fruit and brown bread. the taste follows the nose and enhances it. medium-bodied. a delight to drink!
6627,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.17,poured into an 8oz glass from mackeys beer festival a clear reddish brown pour and a great big foamy head. snot factory like the warm baked bread a bit of dark fruit maybe a bit of toffee taste is similar. creamy feel smooth nicely carbonated. not very familiar with the style so i will have to keep an eye out for these. a truly excellent beer.
6628,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.4,500 ml can poured into a tulip.  l: clear amber with reddish tint one finger off-white head has pretty good retention but fades to a thin cap in a couple of minutes a lively pour head regenerates with a swirl. s: fairly strong nose malty dark bread plum lesser mineral and chocolate notes. t: malty and medium sweet plum wheat light bubblegum yeast mild booze earthy/woody hops finishes lightly bitter. f: medium body low-ish carbonation smooth frothy light alcohol burn at the finish. o: nice bock beer with supporting wheat character.
6629,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.21,poured from a 500 ml can into a willi becher pint glass. l - pours dark reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that dissipates slowly. s - smells sweet and malty. t - nice and malty with some banana and clove. f - medium body and carbonation. o - delicious weizenbock.
6630,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.14,500ml bottle with the new nonsense date code.  on the pour 2 fingers of off white to tan head that became rocky and a bit foamy over a few minutes until finally settling at a decent tan cap. body is a dark amber to copper with a bit of haze but light still comes through.  aroma carries sweet fig and toffee/caramel but there is a slight savory oxidation thing going on. alcohol isnoticeable but not boozy.  taste follows the sweet malty notes but loses the off notes. im going to blame the aroma on bottle age which for now is unfortunately uncontrollable. traditional banana hefeweizen flavor comes through with a sweet caramelized flavor coming from the malts. honestly very easy to drink and comes off as a dunkelweizen to my untrained american palate. still there is some light figgy fruit going on but this is mostly a very enjoyable dark strong traditional tasting hefeweizen. nice balancing hop bitterness but no hop aromas.   feel is smooth and easy drinking. this beer hides its abv well once its on your palate. slight astringency but this isnt a dry beer. at the same time this beer doesnt come off as huge and thick. the astringency balances the malt well leading to the easy drinking feel of this. medium long finish but its subtle. soft subtle but present carbonation.  overall there are flaws but this is one of my favorite general doppelbock style beers ive ever had although it is the only weizen-doppelbock ive tried. nice traditional hefeweizen flavor merged with delicious caramel sweet malts as well as a nice balancing bitterness. smells a bit funny when it gets old though.
6631,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.25,excellent weizenbock. great caramel color full head fragrant tasty.
6632,HopDevil,3.13,from a fresh tapped sixtel keg. ...tastes like an experiment. if there was a target they missed it. has a lot of good in it but the combination doesnt work. sort of like an oktoberfest or marzan trying to be a high gravity/bubbly ipa. but it looks luscious creamy head nice nose but then goes south.
6633,HopDevil,4.38,poured a semi-lucid copper color from a 12 oz. bottle (best by feb. 15 23) into a standard pint glass with a creamy barley colored finger high head that clings to the glass as it recedes. aroma is mainly malty with overtones of cereal grain and grapefruit. taste is bitter throughout but very well balanced with the malty sweetness and spicy alcohol flavor on the follow through. the bitterness lingers with creamy thickness in the mouth for this medium to full bodied brew. there is even a nice carbonation tingle on the tongue. its been so long since ive had one of these that i had forgotten how good they are. this is an iconic ale that lives up to the hype.
6634,HopDevil,4.05,pours out an amber color with a nice thick head. the taste is somewhat fruity and truly different. some notes of fruit like blackberry or blueberry with a hoppy finish. all in all a great tasting beer.
6635,HopDevil,3.73,maybe im drinking from a mis tapped keg but this was too malty and dark for me. wanted a hop bomb got a malt grenade
6636,HopDevil,4.1,tasty traditional ipa from victory this might be my favorite from the brewer. great balance of hop bite and malt backbone. would look for this fresh again.
6637,HopDevil,4.15,this beer pours a clear dark bronze color with significant effervescence and a moderate head that dissipated quite slowly . as expected there is a strong fresh hoppy aroma. the taste is very pleasant; dry and hoppy with caramel undertones. the mouth feel is a bit syrupy but still refreshing.
6638,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.47,canned 7/7/23  this is a massive cuvée using a blend of 7 different component beers. given the lineup of beers in the blend i have a hatd time believing that this will be anything short of amazing. let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about  pours almost completely pitch black with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  the nose is definitely sweet but in a complex way that doesn’t become cloying. i’m picking up on aromas of dates toasted oak toasted walnut molasses black cherry sweet bourbon brown sugar milk chocolate light caramel and orange peel  it’s even a touch sweeter in taste but still so well executed. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting black cherry molasses cocoa powder dark toast burnt caramel brown sugar raisin toasted oak sweet bourbon and poached pear. the swallow brings notes of toasted oak molasses sweet bourbon black cherry orange peel cocoa powder brown sugar vanilla toasted coconut and light raisin  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer. finishes mostly dry and drinks well below its abv  this is so damn good. i’m not surprised given revolution’s reputation for massive barrel aged beers but i’m just happy to be drinking it
6639,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.53,the appearance is the color of a barleywine but the opacity of a stout. light brown with very little translucence at the edges. nose is oak for days accompanied with bourbon caramel vanilla roasted malt coconut dark fruit and ethanol for sure. taste is similar. strong oak presence slight dark fruits covered in confection roasted malt bringing a very faint chocolate and coffee and some hop presence. the ethanol heat doesnt seem to be too strong on the palate. it is drying but it doesnt illicit images of deserts in your mind. the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. almost no carbonation. overall a great brew. i didnt realize this was a whopping nearly 16%. i thought it was around 14%. seeing as ive finished this can and my vision is swimming i can say that while this brew does not hide its power on the nose it does it better while drinking. which i feel matters just a little bit more.
6640,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.57,canned 07/07/2023  a: pours black. a one-finger tan head on an aggressive pour quickly (and loudly) dissipates to a thin layer clinging to the circumference of the glass. no lacing of note. s: oak bourbon dark chocolate small bit of vanilla t: follows on from the aroma for the most part - oak & bourbon showing their heft but notes of chocolate help to provide a nice counterbalance on the proceedings. m: medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. creamy. o: this beer requires patience. patience to allow it to reach near room temperature as this is when it really flourishes imo. just a fantastic blend of rev ba beers here. outstanding beer.
6641,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.62,my goodness this is absolutely exquisite. layer upon layer of complexity with nothing to suggest an abv approaching 16%. i get warm notes of boozy fruit gently drizzled with chocolate coconut and vanilla. so much more here but im just going to sit back and enjoy this.
6642,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.56,pours blackish-brown. aroma is incredible & intoxicating. well balanced sweetness of caramel brown sugar oakiness & bourbon. taste is also complex combo of caramel brown sugar hints of vanilla chocolate and charred oak. mouthfeel is full and matches the taste. outstanding.
6643,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.76,8 ball black with a short tan head that fizzles out in large foam bubbles fairly quickly.  deep oak chars vanillin and peppery whiskey introduce the infinite complexity of this incredible blend that only gets better as it warms. it deftly avoids being oversaturated decadent or sticky with an illuminating carbonation--for lack of a better word to describe how it unveils layer after layer of novel characteristics--that helps it to nearly vanish in the finish.  the less than viscous medium body actually improves the expressive delivery of its idiosyncrasies. i cant get over the depth here particularly how im failing to find descriptors that do it justice but even more astonishing is how there isnt really any burn despite the nearly 16% abv.
6644,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.49,canned 7/7/23; drank 8/1/23 @ the yarchives.  black/brown appearance.  a violent pour yielded a huge noisy tan head which quickly dissipated; no lacing remained.  oak dark chocolate cream & booze heat notes in the nose.  creamy thick mouthfeel.  dark chocolate & cream flavors up front; oak & a hint of orange peel on the finish. booze heat emerged as this warmed.  cold this falls flat but at near room temp it shines. another winner from the deep wood series.
6645,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.55,12oz can poured into revolution deep woods stemless glass.  canned on 07/07/23.  appearance: light black bodied beer with a thin cap of light brown colored head. the head drops down to nothing. this has booze legs for sure.  smell: there is a lot of oak bourbon and barrel notes to be had. it leans towards stout notes but caramel/brown sugar notes are also easy to pick out here.  taste: caramel toffee brown sugar & vanilla notes of the ryeway & gravedigger components which are rich and satisfying right out of the gates. starting around mid-palate you start to get some darker flavors & barrel notes including hints of dark chocolate light smoke/barrel char leather molasses and tannic oak. as for the finish the dark flavors fade into a balanced barrel finish with dry mature oak notes punching through and the return of some more brown sugar and toffee notes with the addition of some maple & nutty notes as well. incredibly complex. delicious barrel aged beer here.  mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low moderate carbonation. incredibly drinkable beverage here.  overall: probably my favorite cuvee de grace blend from revolution so far; 2019 blend is a definitely in a close 2nd place but 2019 blend was a miss for me and is in a distant 3rd place.
6646,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.35,on tap. tan head. dark brown color.  caramel toffee rye rye spice molasses oak bourbon lots of bourbon. brown sugar plum red apple skins. lots of good things going on here. barleywine ish but a bit lighter. coconut as it warms. very smooth. very enjoyable.

6655,Apricot Ale,4.21,rated in 2016 and gave it an overall of 3.58.  thought id give it another go. 2009 bottling.  uncorked bottle and lost half of contents to it be a gusher. ugh.  cloudy pale rose color. medium nose. fruity flanders red style. taste was a lot more balanced. nice stone fruit presence. thirst quenching drinkable and much more palatable.  okay came back to bump up my score. its growing on me...
6656,Apricot Ale,4.02,13 oz snifter draft pour at lures bar & grille. pours a hazy creamy yellow with an off-white head. aroma and flavor feature sour apricots oak tannins leather funk clean malt and tons of acidity. very sour. mouthfeel is prickly and astringent. overall its tasty but a bit unbalanced.
6657,Apricot Ale,3.73,375ml (corked and caged) bottled 2017. opened 6-20-20. small pop and hiss upon opening. small white head that disappears quickly. no lacing. bright golden apricot flesh color and fully opaque. vinous aroma oak barrel and muted apricot fruit initially. bracing acid tart and bright fruit and just a hint of powdery funk. the apricot becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. overall the warmer it gets the less sharp and more flavorful/enjoyable it gets. medium body low plus carbonation. lengthy high acid finish. very good.
6658,Apricot Ale,3.58,cascade is one of the few u.s. sour brewers that i regularly enjoy. i have no idea why. 750ml c&c bottle/2015 project split with my wife.  i’d be remiss if i didn’t mention i picked up this bottle at hyvee for $5 on clearance. because why not? the pour is unalloyed gold with plenty of life with a nose of what? tart apricots. that’s just a guess.  apricot ale is a sharp simple beast. nitric acid puckers the palate & the barrels team up to cause arid mouth syndrome. apricot is subtle but runs throughout. light & airy. this glass is going to do me just fine but it’s the rare sour i can consume more than one of.  not cascade’s best work but perhaps the apricot is just not enough to stand up to the microbes. still a good solid brew.
6659,Apricot Ale,4.45,500 ml bottle served in a sour glass 2017  this beer pours a hazy yellow color. it is topped with a fleeting tan head that leaves no lacing.  the smell is pretty damn amazing. i get funk dank basement and an acidic flanders ale smell. there is tart apricot. this is what i want sours to smell like.  tart and acidic. the apricot helps cut the acidity but only so much. it has that wonderful dank basement and funk flavor. the sourness is puckering and i love it.  light bodied with a dry mouthfeel  i picked this up at a local store off the 1/2 off shelf. i am pissed that i didnt buy them all. i hope someone doesnt beat me to it. great stuff!
6660,Apricot Ale,3.86,a 750ml corked and caged bottle 2015 project. poured into a 3 fonteinen stemmed glass.  appearance: a lightly hazy golden orange colour with a one finger white head that had decent retention while leaving lots of nice lacing.  aroma: tart apricot oak hay lime zest light funk.  taste: sour very sour tart apricot hay dust wood oak lemon zest.  mouthfeel: moderately sharp medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  overall: the flavours were enjoyable but it was just too sour and coupled with the acidity it was just a bit too much for any easy drinking but good for sipping.
6661,Apricot Ale,4.14,this is one i prob should have had fresh but alas it became a cellar beer. 2008 vintage so hopefully it held up.  pours with no carbonation and no head the cork looked dried out so prob lost its carb over time very clear iced-tea orange-brown copper color with tiny floaties  nose is quite nice not much for fruit but plenty of sour funk big bacteria souring and acidity acetic and lactic acids little barnyard funk getting a touch vinegary with some buttery oak still there and a bit of candied stone fruit in the background some malty aromas as well  taste brings more of the malt and sourness a bit of a sweet candy malt and caramelized sugars with some candied apricot not a ton a bit of alcohol but not much souring bacteria again with mild acetic acid maybe lactic but hard to tell light barnyard funk a little malt vinegar into some buttery oak as well mild tart flemmy finish lingering sourness malt and candied fruit  mouth is med bod a little fuller touch syrupy med acidity and funk low to almost no carb light alcohol warmth  overall not bad definitely an enjoyable sour but apricot is mostly gone as expected. if im ever out there again ill def have to try this fresh provided there arent 20 other beers i need to try like last time i went.
6662,Apricot Ale,4.42,2015 bottle.  a - pours clear orange to the dregs a pretty sight with a moderate white head some thin lacing.  s - acidity with punchy apricot lushness a hint of funk.  t - bright sourness a mild fruit hit a subtle minerality and just a hint of sweet apricot that lingers in the close.  m - mild carbonation and prickly acidity closing with a slick long tail.  o - a superb sour delivering a solid bright core and lush fruit.
6663,Tripel,4.58,poured from a 330ml bottle.  pours a slightly hazy golden straw with a huge  domed white head and only a little visible carbonation. the smell is of mellow yeast and slight banana and the taste follows on from this whilst adding notes of toffee malt  bread fruitiness and a medium bitterness everything is very well rounded together. the mouthfeel is thick without being syrupy subtle prickly carbonation and a warmth from the alcohol. overall a great beer subtle complicatedrich without being overpowering .one i think id notice different things on on different occasions. 
6664,Tripel,4.19,absolutely beautiful pour. gold amber big foamy head that lasts well. instant sweet esters and yeast with some banana aromas too. taste follows now with nice carbonation and a sweet dry finish almost like a dessert wine finish. lovely and complex triple. really enjoyed it.
6665,Tripel,4.35,a - pours golden orange body white head persistent cap lots of lacing.  s - bright yeast forward nose with spun sugar and limestone predominant.  t - clean and bright banana notes earthy hops and a mildly bitter sharp backend.  m - prickly carbonation moderate weight dry close.  o - a mighty fine tripel - delicious and satisfying.
6666,Tripel,4.3,aroma is your typical belgian banana-ester-malt and the body is an excellent example of what usually comes after: a bright refreshing wave of banana clove honey and malt with delightful and refreshing carbonation. a delicious exemplar of the belgian tripel.
6667,Tripel,4.46,11.2 oz bottle from a mix 4pk exp date 01/06/24 into a watou chalice. l: pours clouded apricot orange with a very thin white head that is a skin low carbonation no lacing. s: banana bread clove a hint of rum gains more hop aroma with light warming. t: fruity banana bread light clove yeast a hint of citrus zest white pepper a suggestion of grains wheat distant cork. it is gently sweet. f: gently brisk lightly juicy medium-light body with a fairly fast & dry finish. becomes more smooth with warming yet retains a light & bright fizz. o: i rolled the bottle to get some sediment into the pour and it was a very slow pour that produced no head. this was on purpose. the beer is lively and foams over if poured quickly esp into the correct chalice. this affects lacing as well. nice to have the option. overall a beautiful tasting and drinking beer. most certainly a sipper and has a classic belgian taste & feel. no noticeable traces of alcohol yet it is lightly warming. it is outstanding in its style.
6668,Tripel,4.34,classic delicious easy drinking for 8% abv. sure to have you feeling good.
6669,Tripel,4.47,dry and crisp with many tiny bubbles in light yellow and cloudy beer; thin but consistent head with strong lacing; slightly over-carbonated requiring a quick transfer from bottle to glass lest it overflow. there is no alcohol bite despite it being 8% abv and not a lot of sweetness. body is very light. taste is fantastic with subtle hops and not too much fruit or spice for a tripel. overall it is one of the best beers i know of and it is slightly more affordable than chimay.
6670,Tripel,4.28,shared 750ml bottle into a teku. dating difficult to interpret.  excellent looking beer. glowing golden body with a strong white head leaving streaks of lacing. slightly musty aroma but such a good taste sweetness some spice notes slightly drying. mouth full finish sweet then dry. lovely drink.
6671,Tripel,4.42,golden with big white mousse-like head excellent retention thick bands of lace honey green bananas slight spice aroma honeyish malt green bananas pepper clove underripe apricot medium bodied highly carbonated clean damn good tripel
6672,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.31,(12 oz can canned on 07/11/23; purchased cold single from brewery this week... poured into my chouffe tulip)  l: amber-colored mostly-clear liquid; ultra-tight jiggly white foam... head settles into thin collar lacing in long thin drip bands  s: blackberry taffy fruity pancake syrup apple-berry fruit rollup hint of lavender... one of the more unique ipa aromas ive ever sniffed... perfumy subtle alcohol highlights... altogether potent if rather hazy/muddy in expression  t: much of the same on the palate; almost green oniony spice buzzing in the aftertaste... berries currants drenched in citrus peel oils... i cant help but suggest this has rather english strong ale hop/malt character/interplay; malt has perhaps a delicate honeyed bran muffin note to it  f: aside from its near bracing bitter sting amplified by the ethanol and a soft carbonate sizzle this drinks like a light-medium-bodied white wine... slight singing heat builds on the palate roof over time  o: a lot of their beers have a distinct flavor to them and this is no exception... a uniquely flavored ipa that drinks like a (hop) resin-ravaged tripel (2190)
6673,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.06,look - bright copper and clear with a nice off white head smell and taste - classic citrus grain imperial ipa feel - medium body with a lighter crisp carb overall - fairly standard but still nice
6674,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),3.75,big citrus and pine resin notes. taste follows suit with ripe orange and grapefruit fins hint bitter. very soft mouthfeel. overall well above average.
6675,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.58,a rice ipa. super clear golden. looks like a budweiser but with a nice lacing. smooth slightly sweet. kuhnhenn call it west coast ipa but the high abv and sweetness covers up much of the bitterness. very good but not a classic west coast. reminds me of a founders hopslam. tender says they get that comparison often but that kuhnhenn came out with the dripa five years before founders figured it out!
6676,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.01,12 oz can from tavour. hazy golden pour fizzy head. aroma is hoppy and lghtly fruity. taste brings smooth malts with a huge hoppy bite. light orange minimally sweet. bitterness stays on the palate. sublime smooth and strong.
6677,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.17,appearance – this is a very hazy dull yellow with a nice off-white head that dissipated rather quickly.  smell – the big lemon stands out in this unsweetened fruit nose. lots of citrus and a bit of straw.  taste – more lemon at the taste and a bit of malts that were hard to find at the nose. the hops are resiny with a hint of pine and very little sweetness.  mouthfeel – this is medium-bodied and extremely dry. the dryness is massive at the finish probably too much for the uninitiated.  drinkability – good thing the bitterness slows you down because at nearly 10% abv it is a heavy hitter.
6678,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.71,fantastic. nice hope flavor but crisp clean refreshing. great beer.
6679,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.98,hard to top this one. hits the spot. kicks you when you get home!
6680,Genny Light,3.88,genesee light is a good beer. one of the best light beers ive ever had. its made in ny which is a major plus. the flavor is nice and has a hint of citrus. carbonation is appropriately measured and its not expensive. definitely worth a try.
6681,Genny Light,4.12,i’m giving this beer a 5 in appearance. there literally was a carbonation “tornado” that formed after i poured into a glass. never in thousands of beers have i seen this. smell is awful taste is very smooth and easy to slug down. enjoyable for what it is.
6682,Genny Light,2.88,24oz can stamped h158 1103:38 poured into a large mug at fridge temp no abv listed on can. the beer pours bright light golden straw yellow with off white head. the head recedes to a thin ring skim coating. the aroma is a little yeasty and vegetable. the taste is very nuetral up front with no real malt washing into a barely tart mildly bitter and buttery finish. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and an undry finish. overall average. too much unfinished business for this yeast. the microwave popcorn butter is the strongest flavor here.
6683,Genny Light,3.67,we utilized this at a middle of nowhere upstate new york casino. found it at a “redemption center” in a one stoplight town. the 12er was located on the bottom of the cooler fridge in a section that hadnt been opened since the 90’s. went down easy and did the job.
6684,Genny Light,4.08,a nice light beer compared to other offerings. flavor is there without any offense. well done!
6685,Genny Light,2.84,poured from the can into a standard pint glass.  a: clear light yellow medium sized white bubbly head that dies down into a compact disk leaving very little lacing.  s: neutral smell light corn light cereal.  t: its pretty much average light aal fare corn and little bittering. infintely crushable like an laal should be. not a ton in the way between this and water.  m: slick light-medium bodied standard laal mouthfeel thats very refreshing on a very hot day.  o: typical laal. id recommend the light version over regular for sure especially if youre just looking to drink outside at a bbq. at $14/24pk. or less most places its kinda hard to go wrong with this one if youre going to be outside packingem away.
6686,Genny Light,4.84,this is easy drinking light beer nice refreshing taste good feel nice aroma overall a quality light beer which bud light isnt also a great value vs bud light 99cents compared to 229 better taste and lower price genny light kos bud light
6687,Tsingtao Pure Draft,2.92,look - golden in color lots of fizziness that fully dissipates quickly leaving virtually no lacing. smell - distinct asian adjunct lager: slightly sweet spicy and some grassy hops. not super interesting but not bad. taste - sweetness indicating considerable rice and comes with a light hoppy bite towards the end with a slightly malty finish. its watery but the flavors are there. feel - as light bodied as it can get high carbonation and not very boozy (so the 4.8% is probably an overestimate) overall - one of the most commonly found beers across china and the pure draft is even more popular than the flagship given its refreshingness: people do drink it like water! as such i have some very fond memories with this beer...score reflects just a little bit of sentimentality.
6688,Tsingtao Pure Draft,3.66,sunday was to have been the occansion of my happy new russo-japanese-vietnamese-chinese canned beer sunday canrades (week 754) (добро пожаловать обратно в с новым русским-日本人-tiếng việt-中文 пиво воскресное товарищи (неделя 754) but i only have one vietnamese can & the chinese beers bogged down because of needing either/both adds & pics. 8={} i am now back on track.  from the can: pure health; draft.  i really debated on just how to open this one. it came with a throwback pop-top like jimmy buffett once sang about & just like the modern 360-degree opening cans i am less-than-enamored of a piece of metal that can become simply one more throwaway. jeff lebo showed me how to canduct a bottom-opening of a modern can & i did so using my late paternal grandfathers extremely pointy letter opener. the initial glug was more of a dribble but once it got going it poured like a champ. in fact there must have been an air pocket since it suddenly let go & really began flowing! it rose up to create nearly three fingers of dense foamy rocky bone-white head before (thankfully) falling away in the days heat & humidity. color was pale-straw (srm = 1- 2) with ne-quality clarity. nose smelled adjunct-free with a light maltiness and just a kiss of the hops. rice? maybe. corn? not so as i could tell at least not on the nose. mouthfeel was light airy watery about what i have come to expect from asian lagers. par for the course. the taste was lightly malty-sweet with a faint hoppiness but again no corn was discernible as an adjunct. it really did not taste too bad at all. i especially liked its lightness on this hot humid summer afternoon when it was just nice to cool off with a beer. ymmv.
6689,Tsingtao Pure Draft,2.5,pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing aroma has slight malt hints the taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor a medium bodied decently carbonated beer a decent beer
6690,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.75,rating skewed because this is pizza to wash down beer and potato chips not to savor and analyze. also skews high because many of its small set of na peers (cheap domestic not craft) have weird aftertastes and/or just dont taste like beer. it hits the spot when its called for!
6691,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,3.99,when you have to go to that place this na is very comforting. the lack of flatness is what grabbed me. did some researching and learned the big houses basicly boiled there alcohol out and recarbonated the beer. old mil spins theirs in a centrifuge to a thin layer and flash heats it. no need to recarbonate it and the flavor (i always liked) does not suffer. i just cant find it when i need too anymore. becks na comes next.
6692,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.79,have to have 1 or 2 nites per week no alcohol so i have these fake beers often. german american canadian doesnt matter. all taste like crap but this one doesn’t have the tell tale after taste i am used to. nice carbonation and not a malt bomb so is drinkable.
6693,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,4.71,i loved it. for a non alcoholic beer it tasted just like a real beer. no malt or bad aftertaste at all. i absolutely love it and will start drinking this all the time.
6694,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.75,tried 3 ways. standard pour into a standard pint glass (followed by same poured into sam adams ipa glass trying to capture more aroma though the former is obviously the most common serving method) and also from the can.  pours a crystal clear yellow gold color with moderate large bubble carbonation. initial frothy head reduces quickly to poor lacing and little rim retention. adhesion on the glass is poor.  smells of wet grass hay corn corn syrup and that paste you ate back in kindergarten (although you wont admit it). very poor though in carrying with the malt liquor and adjunct lager corn based beer category.  all three palette notes are the same--- lots of paste envelope glue candy corn corn syrup stale uncooked rice and a bit of wet hay. very poor if only average at best again considering the category.  syrup like mouthfeel with not so clean finish. lingering corn paste and a bit of skunk cabbage that i honestly wish was more. at least it would be less bland and less like i just revisited my love of paste during art class/non-savory snack time.  poor if not below average at best overall. not recommended. so many other good nas out there... maybe if you want to drink a piece of history... as well as feel like you are... but beyond that checkbox move along young man/lady to something better. the original version is not much better... in fact it might be worse. so yeah. move along after checking the box oh so regrettably.
6695,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,4.5,the color and feel of a straw colored seroma pleasantly metallic tasting notes with a clean wispy finish. it’s a sentimental favorite—the groomsmen and i will always have carmel and old milwaukee.
6696,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.69,rating it for what it is: a non-alcoholic that is fake beer. if i want something in the garage fridge to help convince my wife why i smell strongly of beer this is a good bet.
6697,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,3.85,comparing only na beers bud light and miller lite not my favorite sierra nevada pale ale.: [b]only available in cans in my area.[/b] this poured with a very light straw yellow color it produced a three finger head and still had a full head an hour later. the aroma was definitely that of a decent beer! the taste was that of a very light but fairly full bodied light beer with no burnt or overtly sweet aftertastes. i was not expecting much because old milwaukee has been in and out of production but for a non alcoholic beer this is one american na beer i would serve to my guests along with clausthaler and becks the best of the bunch!!
6698,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1,if you absolutely crave one of the worst beers in the world without the silver lining of at least catching a buzz it doesn\t get any better than this. falls flat on it\s ass in every single category. i\d rather drink a barq\s root beer than this. at least barq\s doesn\t make your stomach turn with every gulp.
6699,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.42,a: pours a crystal clear medium straw yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and some faint golden yellow highlights. the beer has a three finger tall sudsy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of medium thick film surrounded by a very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. significant amounts of lacing are observed.  s: moderate aromas of corn adjuncts over lighter aromas of grainy malts.  t: upfront there are light flavors of grainy malts with light to moderate flavors of corn adjuncts slightly vegetal. minimal amounts of sweetness or hop presence. overall the beer has a very light flavor more reminiscent of mineral water than a beer.  m: light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. slightly thin/watery.  o: very drinkable and definitely lacks the chemical-like flavor that you get in a lot of the american na lagers. very light flavor and aroma.
6700,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.25,a-pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing a-aroma has slight malt hints t-the taste follows the nose with a slight malt flavor m-a light bodied well carbonated beer o-a decent beer
6701,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1.97,i wonder why na beer cant have more flavor and mouth feel. cant you boil up an ipa and just bottle it sterile?
6702,Pumpkin Ale,1.64,this just might be the worst damn beer ever with the exception of bud light. why does most craft beer taste like it has charcoal for a flavor?? nasty crap!!! whew!!!!
6703,Pumpkin Ale,4.31,it is an incredible beer. honestly very close to pumpkin pie turned beer and makes me want to top it with whipped cream. reminds me of fall walks in the woods or hikes where i could enjoy the crisp air and changing leaf colors.
6704,Pumpkin Ale,4.39,golden flash of a head on a dark caramel body. a proper pumpkin pie smell emanates from this one. it tastes sweet in a lactose lite sense with a flavorful pumpkin body and just the right mix of spices. no bitterness and not cloying either. sessionable in a way but also as heavy as it should be. 8% but not detectably boozy. one other thing i like about this beer is that it is objectively a pumpkin beer. other styles moreso mimic strong ales barleywines stouts etc. but this one is simply a fine pumpkin ale and one of the best representatives of the style as it basically what you could ever want and hope for in a pumpkin beer. and the fact that the mash itself is majority pumpkin as a historical basis for the brew makes it very proper indeed.
6705,Pumpkin Ale,4.44,poured out a hazy amber with a white head. the smell is of pumpkin cinnamon nutmeg and malt. the beer really has a great taste and its like drinking a pumpkin pie with a nice alcohol addition to it. good stuff.
6706,Pumpkin Ale,4.18,the saint louis brewery llc pumpkin ale 12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle bottled with love: 06/21/2022 14:09. sampled on 10/11/2022.  notes via stream of consciousness: this is brewed with real pumpkin and spices and it clocks in at a solid 8% abv. why not? if youre going to make a pumpkin or spiced ale that someones probably only going to drink one of why not go big? its poured a hazy reddish chestnut brown colored body with golden highlights beneath a short head of tan foam. sugary cinnamon greets you in the nose backed by a light apple-like fruitiness. the flavor follows and it tastes like cinnamon-spiced apple cider. beyond that theres a bready and lightly caramelish malt base and notes of nutmeg and clove. its moderately bitter and it finishes with a dollop of sweet malt fading to leave behind some spice thats mainly clove at this point. in the mouth its medium bodied and smooth with a moderate fine-bubbled carbonation. the head retention and lacing could both be better but for a spiced beer of 8% its not bad. its not over-spiced over-done in maltiness or body or alcohol and really well-balanced across the board. its really nicely done and although i suggested that spiced ales are generally a one and done kind of beer i truly believe that you could enjoy two or maybe even three of these in a row. review #8311
6707,Pumpkin Ale,4.34,nice mellow pumpkin spice taste and mild aroma. clean finish  no cloying aftertaste!
6708,Pumpkin Ale,4.25,pours amber and smells of what you’d expect from a pumpkin ale. cinnamon pumpkin aromas not sweet as some pumpkins but medium bodied and full. nice smooth aftertaste. a nice fall pumpkin beer!
6709,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.5,wow--been working my way through belgian ales--only drinking 90+ here on beer advocate--this one was exceptional--really enjoyed it--excellent trappist ale!
6710,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.17,11.2 oz acclimated to 58°f and poured into a goblet.  pours a murky cedar brown with lighter flecks of sediment drifing around. has a 1 finger foamy white head dissipating quickly and leaving a nice film of lacing.  initial aroma is rum extract and general dried fruit (primarily prune). maybe chestnut or something else thats nutty? also present is a sweet dairy smell combining with the rum extract smell i cant help but think it eggnog or custard. a general christmas spice can be found as well as a hint of vanilla. this is a lovely and inviting smell that immediately brings to british/christmas desserts wonderful. agitating conjures a creamy dairy aroma followed by that rum smell.  initial taste before swallowing is peppery vaguely fruity and slightly sweet building into some alcohol burn. after swallowing a mellow maltiness comes forward accompanied by a rum extract note and nutmeg notes quickly a sweetness builds joined afterwards by a moderate alcohol burn. i pick up a note of bourbon vanilla further in in the exhale and aftertaste as well as brandy or whiskey or similar later. the aftertaste remains mostly sweet and dried fruit flavored. throughout the whole experience i couldnt shake the feeling i was drinking eggnog which personally i am largely in favor of.  feel is creamy almost like drinking thin milk. i find that it flows effortlessly. the carbonation doesnt last unfortunately but otherwise the mouthfeel is very nice.  overall superb. the only gripe i have is that i found it a tiny bit lacking in flavor. odd considering the alcohol content and i think the flavors present are magnificent but i yearn for just a smidge more. otherwise theres nothing negative to say. the whole experience was very enjoyable and i look forward to trying it again.  will certainly buy again for special occasions just need to determine which of the 4 by the brewery is my favorite. will absolutely recommend the 4 as well.
6711,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.24,lovely molasses brown. sweet raisin brown sugar. great fresh feel. lovely.
6712,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4,delicious! strong malts with subtle alcohol.
6713,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.16,candied plums figs and rum soaked raisins smeared on top of fresh bready malts with some very mild hop bite and a peppery finish. nice yeasty phenols dancing around throughout and hides the abv nicely but its there. definitely delicious but honestly i remember it being better last time i had it a year or so ago.
6714,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.39,tasted from a 300ml bottle into a globe glass.  l - medium brown color with a touch of amber; hazy. strong fluffy light tan head made up of tightly packed tiny bubbles.  s - inviting aromas are mostly malt-based giving dried fruits and a light nuttiness. over that is a gentle herbal hops note and light yeast phenolics which give it a classic belgian flair.  t - the flavors are gentle but keep going into great depths. plums prunes raisins; graham crackers and toast; light cloves dill and a hint of black pepper.  f - medium body. gentle smooth carbonation. medium hops bitterness that perfectly balances the malt sweetness. alcohol is evident but is surprisingly light for the abv.  o - this is a deep nuanced beer. it is never in-your-face but leaves a beautiful impression of craftsmanship and complexity. only the slightly murky appearance hurts its score for me.
6715,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.09,drank straight from the bottle. nose is full skunk with some rice. no alcohol burn or bitterness went down easy. little to no aftertaste. its decent but didnt really leave an impression other than funkiness.
6716,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2,just another generic rice beer. it has a bright yellow appearance. the aroma smells like slightly burnt rice. the taste is much the same as a budweiser or any other rice based lager.
6717,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.2,12oz green bottle stamped 2731 17:55 poured into a vintage pint glass at fridge temp 4.8% abv. label says its brewed and bottled at matt brewing ny. the beer pours bright very pale gold with off white head. the head recedes to a pencil thin ring and island leaving rings of lacing after each sip. the aroma is skunk hay and light malt in that order. the taste is semisweet slightly skunky with a hint of malt and hay. minimal bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. overall ok rice beer.
6718,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3,skunky
6719,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,1.86,put off trying this one for a while because the bottle suggests over compensation was likely. one of the worst tasting beers ive ever had in my life (from a bottle). somewhere in the ballpark of tsintao but none of the clean qualities - had a dirty taste closer to animal urine. would probably be a more useful weapon in a barfight than addition in an esky.
6720,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.2,l: poured a pale gold with a frothy white 2 finger head that quickly disappears leaving be hind a thin white cap and little lacing on the glass.  s: lightly hoppy aroma with a little spice.  t: peppery hop taste with no malt flavor to back it up.  f: smooth and lightly tingly on the tongue easily quaffable. no alcohol burn.  o: easy to drink several in one sitting. much preferred over tsing tao. not as dry as asahi. overall not bad for a rice beer.
6721,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4,a wickedly balanced ipa loaded with hoppy goodness.
6722,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4.65,the beer that made me fall in love with craft beer. so sad its been discontinued but always hoping for a rebirth
6723,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4,pours a clear reddish-brown color with little head. scent is of citrus and hops with the taste surprisingly bitter. light-medium mouthfeel and an aftertaste dominated by bitter hops
6724,Nut Brown Ale,4.47,14.9 oz. can  pours mostly clear dark red amber brown with a creamy off-white light khaki colored foam head. smells real nutty like almonds walnuts chestnut toffee toasted bread caramel a hint of chocolate dried fruits apricot with herbal earthy hops. tastes like nutty caramel almond walnut chestnuts lightly toasted brown bread a hint of chocolate toffee subtle raisin dried fruits apple apricot some tobacco woody cedar pine resin and herbal earthy hops. feels lighter medium bodied creamy smooth with moderate low carbonation. overall a really nice english brown ale.
6725,Nut Brown Ale,4.4,brown in color as expected. head was more white than tan which was not expected. nose is very malty. taste was sweet malty and nutty. very well done.
6726,Nut Brown Ale,3.5,bit of a metallic flavour
6727,Miller Lite,3.01,there’s a time and place for this. not the best beer in the miller stable. you already know how to feel about this. pretty slim taste good cookout beer and a great “one more” beer. not special but not toilet water either. just lite beer nothing more. the best of its kind in a way.
6728,Miller Lite,3,i can’t believe i’m actually reviewing a light beer lol i expected to review a yuengling light or a modelo oro before this one anyways. it’s miller lite it tastes better than coors light and bud light which i’ve known for years. it tastes like a nerfed version of miller high life which isn’t a bad thing if you’re trying to lose your spare tire. it pretends to identify as a pilsner on the label while being an american adjunct lager i guess some guy on the marketing team heard the word pilsner back in 1942 and slapped it on can. if i ever fully transition to 4% beers miller lite would be a good choice.  style: american lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 4.2% | rating: 3
6729,Miller Lite,3.03,not a bad beer.
6730,Miller Lite,1.3,tasteless and watery for a so-called pilsner. smell was like corn chips. tasteless sandpaper. mouthfeel like a mix master full of gravel. looks like bunny pee. overall waste of money.
6731,Miller Lite,3.51,it’s ok. not the best and not the worst. in my opinion i’d put this behind coors light and way above the no good bud light. it’s just a typical light beer. it’s better than something like natural light and bud light but below coors light in my opinion. i’d be ok if it was the only beer available. at least it doesn’t taste like water.
6732,Miller Lite,1.28,its definitely drinkable but there’s many better light macro lagers. miller lite is among the worst along with bud lite busch lite natural lite and michelob.
6733,Miller Lite,2.9,cant go wrong with miller lite. good beer.
6734,Miller Lite,3.25,a good cheap session pilsner first one i have had in over 20 years and didnt realize they still made it
6735,Miller Genuine Draft,3.37,a faintly gold clear body with minimal sparkles weakly builds a short white head of airy foam that dies fairly quickly.  if ive had this before it was from an uncles stealth at as a preteen but even now i really cant be sure just how incrementally different this is from high life not having them side by side.  its lightly bread softly effervescent semisweet and very mildly herbally tangy. the nose is a faint touch toastier and also a little white grapey.
6736,Miller Genuine Draft,2.29,its a pretty standard american lager. theres not a lot to set it apart from anything else out there. getting it on tap in milwaukee is really the only way to drink it. after having that drinking it out of the bottle anywhere else just tastes off.
6737,Miller Genuine Draft,4.83,this is a good smooth tasting traditional lager for a backyard bbq or sitting by the pool on a hot summer day. if you\re looking for something crafty then look elsewhere. but if you looking for a good lager at a decent price then mgd is the beer you want. i\ve been drinking it since the 80\s and i haven\t found a mass produced beer that\s better.
6738,Miller Genuine Draft,2.68,look: clear golden yellow with 1.5 fingers of white head that dissipates quickly. smell: subtle hints of wheat. not much aroma. taste: clean lager flavor with hints of corn. feel: light-bodied with moderate carbonation. overall: drinkable but nothing special. this is a passable beer if you are a college kid with a very limited budget.
6739,Miller Genuine Draft,5,for the category that its in it is excellent. for those who compare it to a craft beer discount their opinions. craft beer has gone way too far in the hazy category. enough. this is a nice return to traditional american brewing since world war ii. it is affordable and delicious. many craft beers have gotten way too pricey and not worth it. ...the beer knower.
6740,Miller Genuine Draft,1.29,pretty sure i wont like this...but hey i really want to reach 400 reviews on beer advocate so lets give it a go.  contains corn syrup. as its american this is probably genetically modified. oh well i had a shit day and really need a beer so fu ck it. oh but its brewed in the czech republic so hopefully not. who knows.  quite a pale colour...light head. aroma is unexciting and pale like the appearance. not that pale is an aroma but it still describes it perfectly. slightly ricey and corney.  taste is kind of ok in terms of the hops. its kind of sweet with the corn syrup prominent. a little bit of a soggy cornflake taste. hops are quite interesting and different from most german czech polish romanian dutch mexican and belgian pilsners. but for me there is much too much corny sweetness i wouldnt want to drink a lot of these even though it is easy drinking. its not crisp enough or dry enough to work as a refreshing or session beer in my opinion. with a bit less corn syrup and more hops and more alcohol it could be ok.  feel is watery with a little complexity in the hops and corn syrup.  definitely not great...i prefer a budget lidl or aldi pilsner over this. and im definitely not a fan of the corn syrup. better than some but not something i would ever buy or order again unless there was no other choice ; )
6741,Miller Genuine Draft,4.48,some of you guys need to chill a bit. this isn\t 2013 anymore. it\s just beer. a pretty decent one at that. i\ve been there and back again in the craft beer world over the years; hell i almost started up my own farmhouse brewery. the only thing that stopped me was risk aversion and a total lack of business sense or knowhow as far as how to raise capital.  this is a beer that reminds you of old times. of dad and grandpa letting you take a sip of beer as a kid back in the late 80s/early 90s. you cant get those kinds of moments back. but you can remind yourself of them through food and drink. everyone dies someday but corporations are forever.  is it a mass produced product of a giant corporation hellbent on dominating the market and crushing craft beer at all costs? yes.  but is it damn good too? yes.  bread water salt yeast and light hops.  classic and filling.
6742,Iron City Beer,3.38,12oz bottle  on a hard pour 1 finger of white head forms then dissipates to a sporadic covering on top of a clear golden yellow body. lacing attempts to form but fades to nothing. average to decent aal.  aroma is surprisingly malty with some corn and a mineralic crispness. not a craft lager but for 9.00 a sixer this is decent. not all that interesting but solid for the style and price.  taste is again better than expected with the american lager yeast character being present but not offensive. maltiness and corn is more subdued than expected from the aroma. very clean but a bit boring. super smooth.  the feel is verging on light but thats what this beer is. there is a surprisingly medium-long finish. the beer is relatively dry and very drinkable.  overall im glad the first time ive tried ic lager they brew in their own facility. this is a good relatively cheap american adjunct lager.  long live pittsburgh the paris of appalachia
6743,Iron City Beer,2.45,pours a clear sunset yellow brief fizzy head formation and retention or lacing. nose is slightly sweet with some cooked vegetable vibes; cheap caramel candy as well. taste is slightly better though there is a very distinct metallic note. finish continues adds a little sweetness and hop bite the main flavor i get is metal which is appropriate for the name. feel is light without and without much punch to the carbonation. certainly drinkable but not too much going on here.
6744,Iron City Beer,3.74,poured from 12-ounce bottle into a stemmed glass goblet. crystal-clear dark amber with a center pour yielding a couple of fingers of pillowy white head that settled in short order. they call this the beer drinker\s beer and not without good reason. looks like a beer tastes like a beer. toasted grain on the nose and palate with notes of herbal hops grass and granny smith apple. rather light in body with a slightly oily finish. i could see pairing this with cookout fare which i\d guess is not a novel idea by any stretch. a pleasant departure from insipid macro swill. recommended.
6745,Iron City Beer,3,had not had an iron city for a long time until last week. it was my first time drinking this beer since iron city brewing opened their new facility outside of pittsburgh. no longer brewed by a contract brewery but made on premises it was very good. those who remember iron city as a trash beer should give it a second chance.
6746,Iron City Beer,5,a great overall lager made by union workers who have a vested interest in the beers. i would put this up against any german lager or pilsner. has just the right amount of bitterness for a lager.
6747,Iron City Beer,1.22,sorry pittsburghs iron city fans but this just is not a very good beer. pours bubbly and with very little head. head goes flat quickly. no aroma taste to match. no detectable hops... or much malt for that matter. more like a soda as opposed to a beer. had this years ago in the mid-seventies. it was passable then but its gone downhill.
6748,Iron City Beer,5,was in town to see brothers koch perform live. tried iron city. solid in the throat. lil putrid in the nose. yins give it a try.
6749,Iron City Beer,5,this beer embodies the culture and history of pittsburgh. sure it may taste smell and drink like any other local lager. but it’s not about the beer it’s about the city. it is perfectly “solid” and “yeah that’s alright.” but truer yet it is the beating heart of the city. cheers to pittsburgh the paris of appalachia!
6750,Iron City Beer,3.08,on tap at primanti brothers in pittsburgh. im not sure how to describe the taste. something other than malt or hops. kind of sour cardboard. didnt finish. luckily the burger was amazing.
6751,Iron City Beer,2.47,another beer from my brother in ohio. wow! this beer takes me back to my high school years when we used to drink this every chance we had. not as good as i remembered. surprised its still available. oh well i gave it a try.
6752,Iron City Beer,4.12,16oz can stamped 0732 (about 5 months old) poured into a becher glass at fridge temp no abv listed on can. the beer pours bright light amber in color with off white head. the head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. the aroma is mild and beery. notes of pale malt and mineral mostly. the taste is semisweet pale malt with a hint of corny tang. mild bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. cleanly lagered. overall very good aal. i would definitely keep this around if it was local and fresh.
6753,Iron City Beer,4.71,as much as i like yuengling lager iron city has it beat. a cool refresher that serves well in the heat of summer and pleases on cold winter nights. great with food--especially mexican pizza or chili--or by itself.
6754,I.C. Light Mango,5,not a fan of flavored beers in general but this one….is amazingly refreshing on a hot summer day. still has that beer balance with a not overwhelming mango finish. mango may be the best flavoring for beer…at least go the iron city brand. a great beer in general.  iron city got a bad rap when the actually moved out of the city. however they are back but still having trouble getting tap space in bars. they were ubiquitous in bars before the move. all their beer are great in general.
6755,I.C. Light Mango,5,love this beer!!! it is a great beer from iron city... come on its soo much better than iron city. its a fun beer and its soo sad that iron city does a poor job marketing this! i also feel its very sad that the local places dont carry it and that it is sooooo very hard to get it at pnc park heinz and ppg... come on its a freaking local beer its good show your support!!!!!
6756,I.C. Light Mango,3.37,amber lager deeper color than a light beer. fruit straight away mango definitely. sweet to start the slow to sour. carbonated but then quickly to a traditional light beer. overall a yummy summer beer will keep on hand for hot days.
6757,I.C. Light Mango,4.69,this one slaps beyond belief. top tier beverage for sure. if you dont back this brew i honestly dont know why. quit lying to yourself. it slaps. fools need a lesson on good beer lmaooo
6758,I.C. Light Mango,3.92,went down as smooth as butter very tasty as well. yum! could be a little sweeter. tastes like flavoured water. mango very fresh. pretty ic look tastes fire. it would have a better rating if they made shirts for it i’ll give you guys a 5 if you send me a shirt
6759,I.C. Light Mango,3.55,poured from a clear 12 oz. bottle. has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of sweet mango. taste is mango some grains sweet but not as much as the aroma would have suggested. feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall this is one of the better beers i have had both from this style and this brewery.
6760,I.C. Light Mango,3.04,a- bland gold with half finger head that dissipates quickly.  s- pungent mango with minimal malt  f- sweet mango with watered down feel  m- watery and light and mango  o- better than expected.
6761,I.C. Light Mango,2.23,pale gold color with zero head. lots of clarity.  aroma is of moldy broccoli stewed beets and mango puree.  the initial/base flavor is really awful like used chewing tobacco but its entirely grainy. then a nice mango flavor comes in - whether its artificial or real i guess it doesnt matter because it takes over the nasty flavor so its a welcome arrival. the finish is of mango/grapefruit lozenge. a general rotten flavor sustains throughout the profile.  feel is nonexistent. just very thin empty. clean though. nice carbonation. light chalkiness.  overall much less impressive than the berry flavor. i didnt like this one at all.
6762,I.C. Light Mango,3.12,pittsburgh brewing co. i.c. light mango 12 fl. oz. clear glass bottle. ink jet packaging information is worn and illegible. $2 @ weis conshohocken pa  the label for pittsburgh brewing co.\s i.c. light mango is basically the recipe: it\s i.c. light with natural flavors and artificial sweeteners added. that sound a little bit harsh but it actually gives it pleasant and surprisingly realistic mango flavor. the only surprise is that it\s also lightly skunked ~ and i\m assuming it\s only lightly skunked because there aren\t that many hops in there to begin with. still it doesn\t come across as sweet even with the additional sweeteners. it\s an interesting and enjoyable light beer that would be perfect for summer and at just 3.8% abv you could drink a few if you wanted to. a very good entry into the fruited light beer category.
6763,I.C. Light Mango,3.29,my senior manager brought a 4pck from pa. it was 95f with high humidity today with real feel being 103f.....this tasted awesome. it poured a golden clear with initial white head that eventually dissapated leaving no lace. the scent was mango. the taste was light beer with mango flavoring....bordering a shandy. the mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. overall its decent and great on warmer days
6764,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.49,solid beer. great initial feel in mouth with luscious flavors. finish is not as strong almost tasted like a lager for a minute which was interesting. but very tasty overall bravo!
6765,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,2.22,maybe a bad can?
6766,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,5,look - thick juicy orange hazy. small white head. smell - strong smell of peach up front mango galaxy hop dankness citrusy hops. taste - peach ripe pineapple mango galaxy hop dankness citrus pith. feel - juicy medium carbonation. im picking up the distinct wonderful flavor of the galaxy hops amongst the many others in this gem. overall - very impressed with this dipa. this brew is juicy and super delicious! i paid a premium price for this and it was worth it. ill be picking up another 4 pack tomorrow. even tastier while listening to dont fear the reaper by blue oyster cult. more cowbell baby!!
6767,Weihenstephaner Festbier,3.69,pours crystal clear golden yellow with a thick white head. nice lacing. beautiful looking beer. aroma is faint some biscuit a little malt. flavor is a bit sweet in front biscuit yeast malt. delicious. feel is light bodied and adequately carbonated. overall a fantastic beer.
6768,Weihenstephaner Festbier,4.05,these folks make the best hefeweizen on the planet so i was curious to try this fest beer .... i guess i shouldnt be surprised that its pretty damn good .... i wonder if this is made for american consumption like so many of these are or this is what theyre actually drinking in the old country
6769,Weihenstephaner Festbier,3.88,absolutely lovely festbier from pour to finish. crystal clear light gold. medium carbonation but effervescent and light feel. nose is not particularly complex whatsoever light malts but nothing to write home about. this is more than made up for though by a clean and crisp bready and malty taste with a light and fluffy-sweet finish. delicious.
6770,Weihenstephaner Festbier,3.54,very nice head with good lacing. a bit hazy the smell is very muted l can only pick up a hint of malt. taste is where it’s at! a light bread citrus slightly sweet honey very nice!! feel is also way up there very light on the palate with very smooth carbonation . overall l have to say this is a true fest bier with a 5.8 abv. prost!
6771,Weihenstephaner Festbier,3.71,8/19/23 poured into my heidelberg stein from a 12 oz bottle purchased at washington beer store in washington pa.  look is a clear dark straw with white lacing and head.  not much in the aroma. lager slightly soapy. malt comes through. tin as well.  bright and light with a decent malt backbone. slight lime tones. high carbonation makes this quite refreshing!
6772,Weihenstephaner Festbier,4.21,a well made festbeir. clear light gold appearance with a 2 inch white head. not much lacing. aroma and taste is balanced and smooth. no problem drinking a few of these in the august heat.
6773,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,4.1,september 2023. hartwell. super smooth and easy to drink. definitely a go to for oktoberfest.
6774,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,4,excellent oktoberfest! very well balanced.
6775,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,4.06,beautiful crisp clear beer. snowy fluffy white head caps it off. bubbly zesty and crisp feel. malt yeast and biscuit on nose and taste. decent dry finish. lovely stuff from a superb brewery.
6776,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,4.24,many many years ago i was fortunate enough to actually sit in biergarten of this amazing brewer .... it was one of the highlights to my entire trip to bavaria ..... if this is what these people say octoberfest beer should taste like im fine with that. that said pretty darn good!
6777,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,4.55,best marzen i tried with some margin. not overly sweet and i could not feel alcohol like in other marzens. amazing as expected really from ayinger.
6778,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,4.1,pours a nearly clear copper color with a 1f head with moderate lacing.  smells of malt and yeast.  tastes of sweet lightly toasted malt bready yeast and caramel with a slightly bitter alcohol warm finish.  medium light body with light carbonation. slightly syrupy mouthfeel.  this is a very drinkable sweet brew.
6779,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,4,my first authentic marzen what a nice beer. can’t wait to buy more.
6780,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,3.7,really good sweet bready flavor. smells the same. classic beer.
6781,Hopslam Ale,4.4,i always grab a few six packs of this legend when it comes out every january -ish. seems much easier to find the past few years but absolutely a must try beer. ive always loved the faint taste and mouthfeel of honey hidden behind the massive hops and malt. one of the best beers ive ever had.
6782,Hopslam Ale,4.48,excellent dipa. one of the best. only drawback is that it has a pretty strong alcoholic aroma and taste which people may not prefer. really good but just not quite in the same level as a heady topper or pliny the elder.
6783,Hopslam Ale,5,this is the best imperial ipa. 4.45/5 is too low. firstly the smell and taste is exactly what a west coast imperial ipa should taste like. the hops are complex and massive but balanced with the malt and the sweetness. the overall taste is not like a 10% abv beer but tastes more like something that is 8%. i would really like to compare it to both heady topper and pliny the elder but this is the best beer that bells brewery makes.
6784,Hopslam Ale,4.2,was expecting a little better with such a high rating. overall it is definitely better than most would probably buy again.
6785,Hopslam Ale,3.48,here\s a hot take: i don\t think this is a good beer. perhaps i got a bad batch last time but it just didn\t have the flavor profile i\d expect from a beer that almost cracks the top 250. the honey seemed to reduce the supposed hopslam down to more of a hop nudge. this meant any flavor complexity seemed to disappear as well. in this case i think the high abv is also detrimental as it tastes very alcoholic and therefore heavy. too bad \cause it\s a heck of a value at costco.
6786,Hopslam Ale,4.28,in a flight at british open pub. oh my goodness. complex and over the top in all the tight ways. a strong hops palate but also a strong malt backbone. kinda boozy but its new years eve.
6787,Hopslam Ale,4.55,poured from 12oz can to a tulip glass. look is fairly clear burnt orange/amber color with a foamy ivory head that takes a while to fall to a nice cap. sits pretty still in the glass. smell is pine melon caramel apple. aroma is present but not powerful. taste is pretty sweet up front with a hit of cantaloupe and citrus. middle gets a shot of bitterness but nothing too bracing. middle sees more fruit flavor like apple and citrus. a bit of pine hits in the finish but its balanced by a floral honey sweetness. balance is a key characteristic here. aftertaste is apples caramel and honey. feel is medium bodied and smooth smooth smooth. a low carbonation pops up but boy this is easy to drink. overall i should have tried this years ago but balked at the price. this is tasty balanced pretty well between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. way too easy to drink given the 10% abv. i am a fan of this one though.
6788,Hopslam Ale,4.66,still one of the best dipas on the planet even in 2022 with all the competition. what makes this beer for me is the mouthfeel. it\s thick and chewy without being syrupy. wish this was around all year.
6789,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.41,purchased a 2023 bottling in 2023. poured at cellar temperature into a wine glass as my goblet did not survive a move.  vigorous head on pour half filled my glass with fluffy off-white foam like a well-made cappuccino. excellent retention and it took a long time to settle enough to pour a proper glass. beer is a ruddy brown with tawny highlights. some haze and fine carbonation.  immediate malt on opening like walking into a bakery. warm whole grain type bread. putting my nose into the glass my impression is of balance. its subtle and difficult to pull out specific notes but i get cherry a bit of almond orange peel and a light mineral aspect. the expected regional notes of banana and clove are present but subdued  taste is the expected clove and banana plus brown sugar cardamom cream. back notes of coffee beans and mineral water.  mouthfeel starts out with a sprite-like effervescence calming to a velvety creamy texture from the head.  drinkability? yeah its drinkable. if you can get ahold of enough of it to have a session sure you could do it. but after only one bottle i can already tell im starting to miss subtleties that i picked up at the beginning. much more affordable beers to tie one off with. but for any beer advocate this is a bucket list item worth checking off the list.
6790,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.88,pours dark amber into a snifter. very thin and white head which mostly disappears with a slight film left throughout the consumption. smell is complex fruits spice a bit of malt combine for a wonderful aroma. slight alcohol vapor helps bring the scents up and out into the air. mouth feel again complex. 10.2 abv is there but no alcohol burn . smooth with the spice and fruit finishing without very little aftertaste. overall a truly world class beer.
6791,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,the hype is real
6792,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.75,smooth taste of caramel with nutty notes in the aroma. amber color with a white head. well balanced full-bodied with a pleasant lingering aftertaste.
6793,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.17,drank this is a belgian beer cafe in warsaw old town a few years ago so reviewing from memory. it was definitely kind of expensive but not as expensive as i was expecting. on a cold snowy lonely night...it seemed the perfect idea.  it definitely looks as beautiful as any beer i have seen. deep dark and mystical. and i remember the aromas being similar...deep and mystical...and complex.  i remember it being mega smooth. my initial impression was that this is much better than rochefort 8 and 10. much much better. as i have never been a fan of either. this has much more complexity and is less creamy...and kind of dark and full of different flavour sensations that are difficult to put into words. however as i am reviewing from memory i will need to review again when i actually have one with me when i am writing.  so yes this is kind of a vague review but i dont remember liking it more than a mega amazing west coast ipa or even a chouffe ipa. it was kind of like a chimay bleu but wth much more complexity. so these ratings are my approximated memories. ciao
6794,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.61,bottle courtesy of rub_this_bbq. actually drank this about a year ago with two friends i was sharing bottles with. we did a side-by-side with st bernardus abt 12 long my favorite quad. although ive left alone my ridiculous scoring of that one (from around 20yrs ago) as it was an amazing experience for me at the time this actually was the superior beer. i just score a lot more realistically these days compared to when i was a noob and whose mind had just been blown by my first quadrupel ale.
6795,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.75,got a chance to try this in amsterdam from a bar that has a guy drive into belgium every three weeks to pick up a case from various trappist breweries. the praise for this beer is well-earned. probably the finest beer i have ever had and certainly the best quad even better than my beloved abt 12. there is nothing at fault with it. it is a lovely experience. i hope i have a chance to try it again one day.
6796,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.94,such an amazing beer! the westy is the unicorn of beers. i bought 48 bottles (2 crates) at the abbey in dec 2017. still have about 15 bottles left. its been interesting experiencing them age over time. they are still drinking well but imho i think they peaked after about 3 years. i did a side by side tasting party in 2019 including beers from all 6 belgian trappist ales (westmalle dubbel chimay bleue rochefort 10 orval achel brune westvleteren 12(st sixtus abbey) and others (st bernardus 12 leffe brune la trappe quad). many of these are excellent but the westy 12 was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of overall complexity and quality. i agree with many of the tasting notes posted before and i wouldnt do it justice to try but i will say if you enjoy the strong quad style do yourself a favor and try one.  obtw i had to call and hit about 500 busy tones before finally getting through to a monk and placing my order in 2017; and i had to go in person to the abbey to pick them up. i believe they now have a website that you can order for delivery. check their calendar for times and details.
6797,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,had at the bar next to the abbey where is is made. absolutely incredible. the smell is absolutely amazing predominantly figs dates and aged leather. the taste is is even better. smooth with complex layers of fig chocolate and other malted notes. honestly one of the best beers ive ever had. im feel lucky to be able to take home a few of them.
6798,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.24,trappist westvleteren 12 from brouwerij westvleteren 10.5 oz bottle. received from @superspak about a million nbs bifs ago – thanks ian! reviewed 05/03/23 (review 3058). note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. stamped on cap “24.10.15”. served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried tripel karmeliet chalice. the final temperature was 59.7 degrees. appearance – 3.5. first pour –deep amber (srm 15) clear. body – amber brown (srm 18) opaque. under direct light same coloration but loaded with precipitate and suspended particles. when rear lite opaque except amber at the edges. head – average (maximum 1.5 cm aggressive center pour) almond high density and fizzy receding to neither crown nor cap just an intermittent bubble ring. lacing – none. aroma – 4.5 – roasted malt dates and figs sweet candi sugar no yeast no hops. no ethanol (10.2 % abv as marked on cap) aroma. flavor – 4.5 – roasted malt dark fruity slightly sweet. no hops no yeast. weak gastric warming. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. palate – 3.5 – medium; lightly creamy initially thins as it warms; lively carbonation. final impression and summation: 4 not bad but maybe cellared a bit too long. the aroma and flavor are fine but the appearance and body have suffered.
6799,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.41,best by 2014 (month has worn away) so bottled in 2011. a kind gift from my sister-in-law. poured from a 330ml bottle into my westvleteren chalice. 10.2% abv. served at 55f.  chestnut/burnt umber liquid with copper/caramel highlights and a small beige cap receding quickly to a lasting collar. adequate retention; fine lacing; delicate yet viscous legs.  lovely rich malty/estery aromatics suggest plum fig date toffee and an old european cobblers shop. weighty yet perfectly integrated and inviting. no perceptible oxidation.  flavor follows the nose but is joined by a low earthy bitterness and some suggestions of brandy and eucalyptus. long linear medium-dry finish. rounded and rich with some complex stewed fruit elements.  modest carbonation but holding up well given the age. slightly thin and quite warming.  more than the sum of its parts and still a top tier example of the style though i look forward to updating this review one day with a fresh bottle.
6800,Landlord,4.23,enjoying on cask in london. im spoiled for my return home to the us
6801,Landlord,4.68,a pint pulled by hand from the cask at the queens larder in london. very excited for this. been waiting a long time to try a beer from timothy taylor’s. from first sip it’s obvious why this is the number one english pale. quite hoppy for the english. any more than this and it’s apa territory. perfect temp great flavor so smooth easy drinking. could have pint after pint of this.  and in fact i did. likely 10-15 pints of this at various pubs throughout the five day trip to london. not bad. even bought a bottle to take home but it’s a bit disappointing considering from cask it’s so delicious.
6802,Landlord,3.23,look: golden amber ale. smell: fruity and hoppy. taste: fruity tang with citrus smoothness. feel: hoppy tang on the tongue. overall: acceptable drinkable ale.
6803,Landlord,3.98,copper golden with fine bubbles carbonation three fingers of white head. the smell is of apple juice and dried hops. a bit of caramel too. taste follows the nose. light and crisp feel. got at lcbo in guelph drank in new hamburg july 20 2023.
6804,Landlord,4.79,had on cask several times on trip to london & oxford. beer heaven.  great taste. great mouthfeel. very smooth and sessional.
6805,Landlord,4.02,pretty good cask pale ale is session-able but still has underlying citrus and bitter hops.
6806,Landlord,3.66,on cask at the lincoln arms in dorking. quite bitter herbal and grassy. the slightest hint of sweetness and citrus. clear amber with a thin off white head. limited aroma not hoppy. medium light body with a dry lasting finish.
6807,Landlord,3.75,had on cask at the bell in london. hoppy at first but pleasant caramel malt finish. not used to the slightly warmer beers in england but it was pretty good!
6808,Landlord,4.57,had on cask. one of the beers i wasn\t getting back on the plane until i tracked down but was surprisingly prevalent! worth the hunt though wonderful beer! the feel is super light and clean yet never thin at all great yeast and hop interaction. taste is centered around grassy and leafy hops citrus and light white bread with english yeast rounding out. nose is more malty with the yeast but hops there too. the wife liked it
6809,Landlord,4.43,4.1% abv in 500 ml bottle. pours a bright clear copper amber colour with two solid fingers of tight bubbly just slightly off white head. aroma of caramel malt bready with slight fruity/citrus note spicy earthy hops. palate starts with the slight sweetness of caramel and cereal malt a bit bready with a bit of citrus and spicy hops - earthy bitterness at the back. solid medium mouthfeel with bright carbonation; deliciously drinkable and punches well above the noted 4.1%. absolute treat!
6810,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.34,appearance: dark red good sized pink head.  smell: cherries tartness.  taste: nice sweet cherry flavor with a bit of tartness a little syrupy feel.  overall: picked up at the source in new glarus im not a fruit beer guy but this was quite tasty. the cherry flavor was more on the sweet side than tart or sour so that was a plus in my book. might even have to get a 4 pack sometime!
6811,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.65,(12 oz bottle obtained at the brewery two days ago... poured into a clear plastic cup)  compared to the raspberry tart i found much more clarity and brightness in this liquid; foam built on the pour but didnt persist long... on the nose: cherry cordial pie cherries; bold and in 3d... on the palate: pie-cherry heering but not syrupy sweet; a flanders red character slowly creeps up in the aftertaste over each sip never subtly malty but the dominant flavor is otherwise pie cherries... the balance this maintains in drinkability is remarkable; clean and almost crisp despite suggesting syrupy residuals; its body sports a lithe drawn out curvature... another spectacular acheivement on their part mesmerizing and moreish; another i havent had in 9 years - glad i have some left! (2187)
6812,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.79,drink it and you can see it’s world class ranking. perfect cherry brew exploding with taste
6813,Wisconsin Belgian Red,5,as perfect a beer as you could find. the door county cherries are as delicious in alcoholic form as they are in pies or raw. the deep red color mirrors the incredible aroma and full flavor of this champion.
6814,Wisconsin Belgian Red,5,i might be biased since a won a beer vs wine dinner with this beer on my dessert course. you can tell they somehow get 16 cherries into this bottle and not in a bad way. its a little fizzy on your lips during the entire experience from the carbonation. this is the most unique tasting beer i\ve had the chance to drink. its thickness is enjoyable since it doesn\t stick to the inside of your mouth. everyone should make the drive to wisconsin to enjoy this beer.
6815,Wisconsin Belgian Red,3.5,good beer but too sweet needs a higher abv than 4% for the 4pk price. a little to cough medicine taste.
6816,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.84,the perfect mix of sweet and tart! it’s way better than sam adams cherry wheat
6817,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.05,great cherr ale slightly sweet great drinking
6818,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.03,friend of mine went to wisconsin and brought this back. poured into a snifter as recommended and immediately caught the whiff of the cherries. this followed with the sweet and tart flavor of cherry and some hint of the bitterness on the finish. expected more of the oak like a cabernet but none to be found. overall a great beer for its kind.
6819,Go To IPA,3.75,after trying a lot of session ipas i basically ended up avoiding the style save for founders all-day. well this bottle of beer which i consumed on the porch during the pandemic reminds me a lot of all-day. it has a soft hop bitterness. many sessions are almost overly hopped and quite thin without the malt backbone.
6820,Go To IPA,3.74,330ml can. l: hazy marmalade colour with a long lasting head and sheets of lacing. s: incredible rich earthy aroma. like freshly turned soil. t: wood and resin. f: bitter and astringent as it’s supposed to be. o: a full-on west coast ipa at only 4.7%. it’s technically very accomplished but the mouthfeel still suffers and i’m not convinced that a beer this bitter will ever be truly sessionable regardless of its abv.
6821,Go To IPA,3.88,330 ml can brewed in berlin. abv is 4.7%. bought at gulating ølutsalg stavanger. hazy golden colour small white head. aroma of citrus and tropical fruits a hint of dill. hoppy and citrussy flavour slightly sweet also notes of tropical fruits and pine needles. bitter finish. good beer.
6822,Go To IPA,3.96,clear gold great white head awesome retention and lace pine orange zest and light dank light orange and pine a little bit of sweet malt but kinda thin tasting light bodied and good carbonation i feel that this would be a good beer for outside around the grill in the summer not just getting in from walking the dog in the winter. id probably like it better then. tried my best to be objective
6823,Go To IPA,4.03,12oz bottle tulip bottled on 10/22/20.  light gold yellow big fluffy head with great retention.  nectarine lemon tangerine. impressively aromatic with lots of delicate fruit.  two row gritty bitterness that’s really great for a session ipa and lots of fruitiness. lychee tangerine white grape stone fruit.  light body dry finish impressive bitterness.  in the running for best session ipa i’ve had. hop aroma and flavor are all there including significant bitterness and great drying bitter finish not usually seen in the sub-style.
6824,Go To IPA,3.73,a: pours crystal clear golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing.  s: zesty citrus mostly lemon and grapefruit grassy resinous pine and crackery malt.  t: citrus zest grapefruit and lemona little tangerine and lime grassy resinous pine subtle fruity notes passion fruit peach apricot and mango crackery malt pretty much bone dry finish.  m: light body moderately lively carbonation.  o: haven\t had this one since it was first released before i was on ba so it\s nice to get to try it again. takes me back to when session ipas were the new toy on the shelf. to its credit this one is bright and crisp and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer. that said it does have a bit of the trademark session ipa watery-ness and there are other session ipas out there with a bit more balance and flavor. wouldn\t turn it down but wouldn\t be my go to.
6825,Go To IPA,3.93,appearance: lightly hazy bright golden hue slim white head.  aroma: as advertised very vibrant and utterly bursting with hops. bold and bright citrus and pine. ah so nice.  taste: more of that big fierce and shining hop flavor with just enough juicy malt below. lean bodied with a dominant buzz of hop bitterness. drinkable yes also refreshing and tasty too. its good beer and i can drink it but…just doesnt thrill me. i really dont desire the session ipa. i like the regular ones just fine thank you very much. faced with the choice of this or a regular stone ipa i know where im going.  this one is merely okay and that\s not what i expect out of stone. low on my priorities.
6826,Go To IPA,4,poured into a tall clear pint glass. clear bright golden color with a finger or so of creamy white head. good retention and lacing.  getting a lot of citrus notes in the aroma. orange lemon and lime zest along with the fruits themselves some biscuity malt mango and a strong smell of pineapple.  tasting primarily the citrus zest and rinds too. nicely bitter hops some pine and resin added in the flavor along with the biscuity malt. cant say that this beer tastes sweet however. body is medium light.
6827,Go To IPA,3.77,12oz botted 10-22-20 best by 2-19-21. opened 11-26-20. 1 finger white head with very good retention. full sticky lacing. clean bright golden ipa. lemon-lime in the nose up front with a bit of green (grass/pine) underneath. zesty lemon and spicy grapefruit bitterness are the prevalent flavors. some stone fruit - peach as well. light body bright entry medium + carbonation. moderate but lingering bitterness in the dry finish. well done very good as a sub-5% ipa.
6828,Go To IPA,3.05,rich gold colour big frothy head three fingers. smell some pineapple and fruity smells. taste is of hefty piney hops and is thin and extremely bitter with next to no malt base to balance it out. feel is watery very bitter and acrid. not an ipa i will go to again unless its for free.
6829,Yanjing 11º Premium,2.55,march 2006: 330 ml green bottle with a green label simply called yanjing beer in france. abv was 4.5%. i presume this is the same beer. pale golden colour large fluffy head. grassy aroma not unlike tsingtao and heineken. relatively dry pale lager flavour not offensive.
6830,Yanjing 11º Premium,2.12,had this on board air china. the crazy rice sweetness is overbearing and theres hardly any hops to balance that out. super adjuncty. smells ricey and sweet but overall just bland. this is bad beer. too sweet. but on air china its free... so i had 2 haha.
6831,Yanjing 11º Premium,2.55,drafty grainy med dried mouth feel grainy citrusy pineapplely peel aftertaste on palate med dried yet crisp and grainy-cornish pie hoppy hint after taste grassy and subdued color is pale yellow foam is presence yet diminshing after a minute or 30 secs
6832,Yanjing 11º Premium,1.5,a: pours clear golden with lots of small bubbles under the rather tall crystal white airy head. disstipation takes some time and leaves nice lacings.  s: rice galore artificial sweetness. bready. some faint bitter hops but everything is very mild.  t: very mild taste rice-smoothness is the only thing that comes to mind.  m: light as water rich carbonation and no aftertaste.  o: if your game is getting drunk drinking water this might be something for you - otherwise dont bother.
6833,Yanjing 11º Premium,3,drank straight from a 330ml green bottle.  smells ok not to bothered.  tastes light malty and hoppy quite watery and refreshing.  overall a decent cheap beer great for drinking in enormous quantities. not wanting to be snobby so what more did you expect?
6834,Yanjing 11º Premium,2.53,coming in a 330ml can bb 24/04/2012 served chilled in a stemmed lager glass.  a: coming in a dark straw colour with moderate carbonation without a substantial beer head. s: light maltiness with a doughy edge not assertive but the slightly sour note of lager beer is obvious at times reminiscent of prunes even. t: a gassy swallow of semi-sweet grainy malts precedes the lightly dry palate and a mysterious sour edge while an interesting perfumey touch of fruitiness lingers at the back as well. it’s not particularly dry in the finish but pretty clean without bad influence from sickly sweetness either. m&d: the carbonation feels more lively on the tongue than meets the eye the body is thin but not totally without form. all in all this lager beer is a watered-down version of german helles lager with added adjunct. not horrible as bud or coors though.
6835,Yanjing 11º Premium,1.75,big 600ml bottle from some hole on the alley in hong kong. around a buck forty. served in a tiny glass. pours a thin yellow color with a nice head that disappears in about 3 seconds... like a soda. quick swirl produces nothing to smell so i pour again and smell fast. smells a bit like urine and corn... getting better. lol. taste is a bit of ginger and generic lager flavor... but the ginger is at least semi interesting. thin and not surprising not that great. but the ginger was a surprise.
6836,Yanjing 11º Premium,1.97,appearance: light golden color. less than a finger of foam on pouring lasted less than 3 seconds leaving nothing with which to lace.  smell: very sweet malty smell. sugary cotton candy.  taste: okd musty taste. wonder where all that sweetness went? not here. a touch of bitterness.  mouthfeel: light body. crisp finish. plenty of carbonation to scrub the palate.  overall: getting close to drain-pour territory. the taste is not appealing to me. as with all my reviews glad i tried it if only to know not to buy it again.
6837,Genesee Beer,2.23,had this out of a 12oz can into a pint glass at tims place in st. albans vt.  pale yellow. not much head. no lacing.  bready sweet arona.  taste is too sweet. corny. almost artificial sweet.  thin. high carbonation. sweet aftertaste.  this was a disappointment. most other aals are better.
6838,Genesee Beer,2.94,12 oz can poured into a pilsner glass on a hot summer night. look is clear pale yellow/gold. white head pours thick and then falls off to a thin cap. smell is grain corn grass. taste is bitter up front then sweet malt corn and grain finish it up. a pretty clean finish is left behind. as it warms it gets hard to drink as it starts to take on some off flavors. feel is light well carbonated. clean in the end. overall i was surprised how much i liked this one. its got to remain cold or it becomes tough to drink. nice and cheap for the 30 pack. a bit sweet tasting but im good with that. this is going to be a new staple in the fridge.
6839,Genesee Beer,1.93,not much to say. its beer
6840,Genesee Beer,2.82,pours a pale yellow producing a small finger of white foam that quickly settles. the smell is malty with a hint of mild perfume. the taste is slightly sweet and perfume-like with a touch of corn. a light easy drinking feel.  overall not bad and the price is cheap at $14/30rack. i prefer high life or hamms over this but i wouldnt turn it down on a hot day.
6841,Genesee Beer,1.92,a little too sweet for my liking. it was a very popular and respected beer in central/upstate new york. in my area it was probably the best selling draft beer for a long long time. i am in the minority in my region for not really finding this beer good.
6842,Genesee Beer,3.61,it tastes good. aint real expensive. and it tastes good.
6843,Genesee Beer,3.25,this ones a real high school memory beer. back in the day this was one of our favorite beers. it was cheap and we could always get it and it was good. still not too bad but you definitely want to drink it ice cold. enjoy!!
6844,Genesee Beer,3.1,its not offensive. i finished up mowing the lawn and it was perfect. i wouldnt serve it any other way besides ice cold. not for beer snobs
6845,Genesee Beer,2.87,poured from an undated 12oz can into my pils glass.  on the pour a light 2 finger fine head forms then over the course of a couple minutes it dissipates to a ring around the glass. the body is a light golden straw with relatively lazy carbonation for the style. no lacing.  aroma is quite malty with some nice crackery notes and the yeast is also quite detectable but in a slightly estery generically beery sort of way. everything smells very light. there is a slight hint of grassy herbal hops. for the style this isnt half bad. as the beer warms diacetyl does become noticable.  flavor is quite similar to the aroma but with some detectable adjunct sweetness. hop bitterness is present but vague and the malt is quite sweet. again once the beer warms diacetyl is present keep this one cold and probably dont pour it into a pils glass.  feel is crisp with a high carbonation bite and a nice foamy head to make the beer feel softer. this is a very cheap beer and for the price it could be a whole lot worse its pretty dang drinkable.  overall this is a cheap full flavor lager that isnt terrible with a nice malty character. there is some off but as long as it stays cold its a pretty good budget option.
6846,Genesee Beer,2.86,they said ohtani couldn’t do it in the manor leagues. they said orson welles couldn’t eat 30 hot dogs in one sitting from pinks. they said nicola tesla was a quack… and they said raul wouldn’t like genesee. but not only does raul he genesee’s through all the haters.  get some.  ok maybe genesee is now sliding… all of a sudden the word “play doh” seems appropriate…
6847,Genesee Beer,1.09,in any category this watery corned water is probably the lamest beer ive ever had in 40 plus years of drinking beer. head is gone instantly no aromas very little cornish hint of flavor no hops noticed. flat as a fart in under five minutes. i expected it to be a mainstream cheap crap lager and it was worse than i expected.
6848,Genesee Beer,4.25,this is a very good regional beer that actually tastes like a real beer.
6849,Genesee Beer,3.75,poured from a 16 oz can purchased at 802 store in arlington vt. pours light yellow with very light head. stale adjunct corn taste with slight carbonation. for what it is its not terrible. decent garage beer.
6850,Genesee Beer,3.6,the beer of my youth. i was weaned on genny’s nipple. best beer ever! but seriously it’s a decent regional favorite that rinses down hot dogs on a summer afternoon. how about that nostalgic “5” i gave it overall? bam!
6851,Genesee Beer,3.36,being from northeastern ohio this has been a staple of my beer consuming years. genesee is not a complex lager and is an easy drinking beer. there are no off setting flavors to speak of and its simplicity makes it very drinkable. barley malt yes corn grits because thats what american and canadian brewers use to brew for the masses and then finally hops. genesee red eye doesn\t have the off putting vegetable oil flavor of mhl or the wet carboard flavor of a.b. you can drink 1 or 6 the flavor is consistent and if your in the mood for a boiler maker this is the perfect choice hands down.
6852,Tenner,4.34,impressive head slow to fade head. it leaves many wide and long streaks on the glass. crystal clear golden color.  bready and soft. light floral hop nose. some unmalted grain smell.  clean and quite crisp. still there’s decent body with a higher level of carbonation. the hop brings balance. refreshing and true to its czech roots. easy to drink many of these.
6853,Tenner,4.25,#1 czech pale lager as ranked by beer advocate  can poured into a pretentious beer glass from my first born as an early christmas present . the glass has an aroma mountain that is supposed to release aromas and flavors . occasional lacings  clear golden liquid capped by a one finger offf white foamy cap  aroma is grassy with a hint of peppery spice  taste is grassy with peppery spice on the finish  clean crisp  quaffable  good beer
6854,Tenner,5,my only complaint is that its too good. i look down and my glass is empty way too soon. this beer leaps down ones throat; just insanely drinkable. very close to the platonic ideal of beer here.
6855,Tenner,4.43,on tap at notch brighton  this is a notch beer i’ve been meaning to try nearly every time i visit the brewery but never ended up getting it until now. with czech pale lager now being an officially recognized style on ba i want to try this even more. this one was the highest rated of the style when it was added but that spot has unfortunately been claimed by their own desítka. let’s see what this one is all about  pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of dense white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  there’s a nice snappy brightness to the nose of this one. i’m picking up on aromas of black pepper crackery malt lemon zest tangerine honey toasted grain and grassy hops  i expected something a bit more bitter in taste and i’m honestly glad that’s not the case. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting lemon zest bready malt pithy grapefruit toasted grain honey floral hops and light white grape. the swallow brings notes of crackery malt peppery hops orange zest pithy grapefruit lemon zest and light grass  a light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation resulting in a crisp yet creamy beer. finishes mostly dry with a firm but not aggressive bitterness  this is wonderfully easy drinking and just straight up delicious. i can’t say i’m surprised though this is one of notch’s most famous beers and they almost always excel with the classics
6856,Tenner,4.49,canned 2022/05/04 pours a 1 finger foamy fizzy head with great retention soapy lacing mostly clear slight chill haze light pale color  nose has that rich grainy malt decoction right out of the gate rich straw pilsner malt cereal grain lots of malt depth and complexity a mild floral fruity and almost kiwi/australian like musty fresh hop but also some noble grassy herbal at the same time faint citrus and grapefruit  taste brings cereal grain more decoction rich malt depth a bit of straw and hint of corn layers of malt mild sweetness then light hop bitterness again that blend of noble hop and australian/nz like hop grassy herbal floral hint tangy fruit citrus even a little fruity white wine thing maybe mandarina bavaria and hallertau sauvignon something like that soft lager a little creamy note like a maibock almost dry crisp finish with a med crisp bitterness and mild spicy note  mouth is med bod soft lager and a bit creamy crisp finish med to a bit higher frothy carb  overall very nice beer love the decoction rich malt depth nice interesting hop character soft lager a little maibock feeling without the off-characters that would normally come from that generally quite enjoyable
6857,Tenner,4.3,16 oz can poured into a mug  a- a fairly clear golden copper with a small white head.  s- sweet bread earthy spice some biscuits a little floral.  t- crackers sweet bread earthy spice hints of citrus a little floral.  m- smooth crisp light to medium body.  o- a well done and nicely balanced pilsner.
6858,Tenner,4.29,16oz can 4/07/21 hf mug l: clear pale straw yellow nice long lasting fluffy white head s: cracker malt and spicy hops t: like the malt nor hops jump out both equal no diacytle light toast / cracker and bright spicy hops (black pepper) m: good carb so crisp   so tasty glad i have a bunch more to enjoy
6859,Bracia,4.45,this one pours a fairly dark black color with a small head and a bit of lacing.  this smells like heavily roasted malt peat light smoke caramel nuttiness dark chocolate and honey.  this is classified as a strong ale but it’s really really reminiscent of an imperial stout. there’s a ton of roast here and just the lightest hint of earthy peat and dark smokiness. there’s some chocolate and a definite rustic nuttiness along with heavily roasted coffee and caramel. the honey adds a pleasant sweetness that helps offset the bitterness here.  this is medium bodied and fairly creamy with no real booziness to it.  i imagine this would take really well to barrel aging given the sharp edges. i do really enjoy the sharp edges however.
6860,Bracia,4.26,i stumbled upon this one almost entirely by accident today at a local store that i haven’t been to in quite some time. i knew the name looked familiar when i saw it on the shelf so i just had to check. as soon as i did i grabbed a bottle. let’s see what the highest rated english strong ale on ba is all about  pours a very dark brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  oh man this has an awesome blend of sweet malt and fruit notes in the nose that i’m really digging. i’m picking up on aromas of dates sweet caramel golden raisin molasses brown sugar dark bread port wine toffee light tobacco and honey  while i still very much enjoy the taste of this it doesn’t quite hit the same beautiful sweetness on display in the nose opting for something a tad more boozy. on the front end of the sip i’m tasting tobacco brown sugar sweet honey fusel alcohol raisin molasses light toffee and dry oak. the swallow brings notes of golden raisin molasses toffee dark toast sweet honey fig black tea light tobacco and a touch of cocoa powder  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a slick beer. finishes a tad watery but with a nice fruitiness to amp it up a bit  this is definitely a unique beer. such an interesting blend of notes going on here that makes for something awesome. i might have to pick up some more
6861,Bracia,4.42,managed to find a bottle no idea the year though but by the taste i am guessing younger. very dark brown pour with a tan head. just as described in the menu: hazelnut earth honey dark chocolate mild roasted malts and a big finishing chestnut. smell has some licorice and light raisin lingering in the honey but otherwise similar though sweeter as the roast and nuts depth doesnt translate as much as in the taste. malty the whole way thicker than expected smooth very warm and rich for style
6862,Bracia,4.5,500 ml bottle as thornbridge hall bracia at cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 10%. pitch black colour large brown head. mildly roasty nutty and malty aroma hints of honey and chocolate. smooth and rich flavour with loads of malty sweetness but not cloying. roasty notes / mild coffee also notes of chocolate honey and nuts. decent hops in the finish and aftertaste which also has faint notes of peat smoke. excellent beer!
6863,Bracia,4.29,poured from fridge temp. this one looks really nice. pours jet black with tan head. nose is charred wood licorice raisin coffee and dark chocolate. taste is black licorice (dominates) chocolate lactose malts sweetness slight bitterness and honey. mouthfeel is thick and viscous. overall an amazing stout.
6864,Bracia,4.24,bottle from bottle shop- druid st. dark and smoky near black with bubbly brown head. aroma is campfire taste is more stout-y some chocolate. warmth sneaks up and makes you glow. once acclimated this one rocks.
6865,Bracia,4.5,poured from 1 pint .9 fluid ounce bottle into glass. no dating information found on bottle or label. opaque black body. fizzy tan head settles to ring fed by bubbles. no lacing. aroma of dark fruit caramel licorice coffee a little chocolate and sweetness. peaty. taste is sweet honey along with chocolate coffee licorice toffee and dark fruit/pear. also bitter hops. peat as it trails off. full mouth feel somewhat coating kind of hot. a beer like a liqueur lots of tastes involved quite rich and heavy. honey sweetness is balanced by the dark notes. i like the peat.
6866,Bracia,4,poured a blackish body with minimal tan head that sticks around. aroma is basically dark fruits like figs/raisins/prunes and some sugariness which i assume is honey. beer is sticky strong and slightly boozy so you get noes of dark fruits honey/toffee and also minimal notes of dryness like nuts and bitter chocolate and/or coffee.
6867,Bracia,4.58,l: -pours a dark brown with faint ruby tinges and a small to mediumfoamybeige head s: -chocolatebananacoffeefudgemolassescinnamonlicoriceleafy t: -coffeefudgenuttyhoneychocolatespicycinnamoncaramel f: -light to medium carbonation -medium to full body -alcohol noticeable o: a fantastic dessert beer.not too sweet not too boozy.perfect for winter. fans of imperial stouts should get this.
6868,Imperial Russian Stout,4.66,beautiful beer: taste smell
6869,Imperial Russian Stout,3.21,i thought this beer was nasty but damn it sure is beautiful in the glass. syrupy boozy whiskey barrel (or wine?) beautiful cut with a knife thick long lasting dark head.
6870,Imperial Russian Stout,4.4,stone imperial russian stout pours a deep dark black with a 2 finger dark tan head perched above. nicely carbonated and beautifully laced this beer is a visual treat for stout lovers. as bold as the beer looks the nose is surprisingly muted but i do detect coffee chocolate and malt in equal measure which is reassuring. the taste is bounces right back to the boldness of the look and is complex. coffee chocolate and malt notes are there but hops push right in. this is one of the hoppiest imperial russian stouts i have ever had and i find that amazingly appealing. as you swallow a fully rounded sweet aftertaste arises... bold like molasses. this brews balancing act of coffee chocolate malt hops and molasses is artfully composed and unique. each flavor stands out and taken as a whole this is a fascinating brew. i have been wondering for a decade why everyone speaks lovingly of stone imperial russian stout and now that i have tried it i believe the rave reviews i have read are all fully justified. what can i say? i will be stocking up!
6871,Imperial Russian Stout,4.31,a jet black pour produces a deep tan creamy head. lacing is streams and spots with varying stickiness. feel is pretty aggressively bitter fitting in with stones reputation but it has the effect of roughing up the nearly full body of the beer for me. aromas open with chocolate and coffee emphasized in the dark malts with the piney hops starting to play in as the beer warms up. bitterness is up front in the taste seeming at first coming from the hops but the roasted notes of coffee hiagh-cacao dark choclate and even a little campfire ember combine and take over by mid-taste. carbonation level is nice keeping the dark malt richness from weighing down each sip too much.
6872,Imperial Russian Stout,4.32,haven’t had this in a very long time. found it on draft in dallas.  poured into a snifter. absolutely beautiful beer. dark brown color with a gorgeous brown head and excellent curtain lacing. smell and taste of dark chocolate and burnt rye toast. licorice and dark berries. bold bitter finish. dry and old school. very nice!
6873,Imperial Russian Stout,3.53,can. certainly fits promotional description and some of the recent reviews. very dark black lots of head dry bitter chocolate and coffee taste. one reviewer compared it to soy sauce which i can see. apparently a top selection of this style which i don’t seem to resonate to. my ratings reflect my preferences would omit if i could. i think i like sweeter stouts like oatmeal stout better and those with caramel notes or less bitterness.
6874,Imperial Russian Stout,3.81,pours black with a little head. the aroma is dark malts maybe some vanilla and hops. the taste is citrus hops dark malts licorice some bitterness with a little bit of vanilla and a tad bit like soy sauce. this is an ok stout but drinks somewhat like a strong black ipa and i’d just prefer having one of those over this. now the espresso irs was something special but this is a one and doner and i did have a higher opinion when i had it a few years back but many good stouts later my palette has probably shifted as it has with other beers as well cheers!
6875,Imperial Russian Stout,4.17,canned 10/2022 (4 months ago)  appearance: pours a completely dark black color with a massive dark tan head. srm of 23-24. (4.25)  aroma: strong aromas of dark chocolate cocoa some bitter coffee roast underneath. somewhat dry.  flavor: strong and rich flavors of dark chocolate cocoa some vanilla dark fruit light espresso roast. yeasty in the middle and ultimately finishes with lingering dark chocolate notes.  feel: medium-bodied strong carbonation. somewhat clean on the palate. surprisingly dry.  compared to sierra nevada narwal 2/2023: pours similar with a larger head. milder aromas. more dark chocolate and roast. less pine. more of a roasty bitterness with less pine.  compared to north coast old rasputin 3/2023: pours similar darker head. stronger aromas. more dark chocolate and bitter pine. less bittersweet chocolate english black malt and cream. darker heavier and more bitter pine.  overall: a very-well made russian imperial stout. dark chocolate coffee roast yeasty yet incredibly dry and drinkable. the drinkability and dryness is the key here and how it hides the alcohol. only this one and old raspy are the two that ive had that can do this. this may be a close second to old raspy. (rating: 4.17+)
6876,Imperial Russian Stout,3.93,never rated the original legend and i will not bore everyone with my history. looks like stout aroma (this is canned which kills aroma and i hate 99% of the time cans). taste bitter chocolate black currant (ill buy that if i knew what it was) molasses (slightly ive had better) no coffee whatsoever. hugely malted smooth satisfying but thin. massive beer but i much prefer the old days $6 an bomber for this and at $19 a six pack no need to have again. one and done the pathetic state of craft beer these days ...
6877,Imperial Russian Stout,4,i do really enjoy this one. it\s just plain good not really mind-blowing but satisfying enough and good for the style. idk why they removed the word russian from the name for this re-release i mean i can assume why but it\s silly when you know the history of the style. anyways i agree they shouldn\t have taken this away. i know they\re known as an ipa brewery but i\ve genuinely enjoyed their other beers as well
6878,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.61,750ml bottle (2016) - pours a deep red with 2 finger pink foam head which dissipates after a few minutes. relatively low carbonation. aroma is cherry with notes of wood and perhaps sour citrus. taste initially strikes the perfect balance of tart and sweet cherry with a hint of spice but the sourness becomes more prominent. medium bodied with a dry finish. absolutely teriffic beer.
6879,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.17,750ml bottle into a tulip. 2018 vintage.  looking very nice. slow streams of carbonation through a deep plum body. small pinkish tinged head replenished though little lacing.  tart cherry aroma with the faintest of funk notes.  on tasting cherries are the strongest flavor but they dont overwhelm. nice balance tart and sour.  mouth medium finish tart sour cherry.  overall enjoyable drinking experience. perfectly balanced for my fickle palate.
6880,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.41,bottle at share. rucby colored pour pinkish head. aroma is cherries and funk woody barrel notes. taste is tart and sour cherries light bodied. cherries through and through.
6881,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.09,a rare beer club offering. pours a dark red color with a minimal head that disappears quickly. aroma of cherries. taste is tart with only an underlying hint of cherry. crisp and dry.
6882,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.25,review 1538 my continuation for trying a bunch of different beers. this beer is a fruit lambic i picked up a month or so back. the beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. the pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish head with excellent retention. the head did not leave any lacing on the glass as it slowly dissipated. the head is creamy and foamy and settling to the bottom of the liquid. the color of the beer is 0reddish-purple with clarity.  the first aromas in the beer are cherries lightly toasted malts and sour lemons. nosing further i detect a touch of horse blanket wet grass toasted crackers oak and hay.  the flavors in the beer are cherries fruity sweetness oak leather a touch of farmyard funk sourness like lemons toasted crackers hay and lightly toasted malts.  the mouthfeel of the beer is tannic tart and carbonated.  the body of the beer is light high carbonation and medium finish.  the beer has a beautiful tartness and finished crisp. the fruit comes through but is not overpowering. the touch of farmyard funk is pleasant and gives the beer uniqueness. solid fruit lambic i enjoyed it.
6883,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.4,750ml green bottle. caged and corked bottle. label lists abv% as 6 for belgian cherry ale. dark reddish brown colored body. slightly pink beige colored head which persists as a thin bubble cap. just a few small spots of lacing left behind. aroma has cherry and oak/leather farmyard funk. taste is a balance of cherry sweet and tart. the funk is more in the later portion and shows oak lemon and leather. the more tart cherry and oak revisit in the aftertaste. medium mouth feel with a dry finish. good carbonation. sublime and balanced use of the cherry with the base lambic. all works together and nothing out of place.
6884,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4,375 ml bottle. pours hazy dark red with tall long-lasting foamy pink head. aroma is of barn yard yeast vinegar and cherries. body is medium and tangy. taste is of cherries wheat malt funky yeast and vinegar. finish is long and very sour. nice sour brew.
6885,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.5,750 ml bottle corked.  pour is a very dark natural-looking red. very thick with a nice pink head.  the aroma is all cherries: sweet and dark with some very light spice nodes shining through as it warms a bit.  the flavor is a straightforward iteration of the style but done to near-perfection. cherries dominate throughout: organic tasting very juicy backed up by yeast spice and tartness. its very smooth and drinkable from start to finish never getting too sour or sweet. the balance is exquisite.
6886,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.23,poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. deep reddish purple color with good initial head and nice lacing. distinct smell and taste of tart dark cherries. some pepper and cinnamon spice. a bit of tart apple and some mellowing pear flavors as well. a very nice lambic!
6887,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.27,dont get the hate honestly! enjoyed this baby for years in australia. great after work delight. needs to be ice cold however to mask slight chemical taste due i think to the reduction in abv.
6888,Victoria Bitter (VB),4.63,my favourite aussie’adjunct’ beer. tastes like most australian beers used to taste like before the abv taxation pushed beers to lower their abv (and flavour). best ice cold and not a session beer at 4.9% but if i want a couple of thirst quenching beers after work this is my choice.
6889,Victoria Bitter (VB),2.9,on-draught at gilligans cairns queensland australia. ~$7.5 aud per pot.  okay its not a bitter so theres a definite misnomer there but its a pleasant easy drinking brew for what it is.  c / average
6890,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.48,a bit of a nostalgia beer (for me). drank a watering holes throughout the nt (darwin etc). burnt firewood taste coupled with a flat formadehyde back note. refreshing but dangerous. not bad for what you get.
6891,Victoria Bitter (VB),1.06,the worst beer in the world! i am ashamed to be a melbournian when it comes to this vile bile. i remember getting drunk on this turd-foam when i was 17 back in the late 80s. the beer scene in melbourne was a lot cruder back then and the variety was pretty abysmal. but hey we were none the wiser. i discovered coopers red back in 1990 and never looked back. glad to say that now and just like everywhere else we have a wonderful variety of beers that i would have died for back then. but - back to vomit bombs. i had the misfortune of drinking a vermin belch the other day and i couldnt even finish it. its like the recipe is - get some hops bung it in a huge vat made of aluminum wee into it stir it around...and wait. about a day. hey presto! the most pitiful beer every produced.
6892,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.09,victoria bitter. vb. the virus beater. the very best. the vomit beer. victor bravos. theres almost as many analogies for victoria bitter as litres of this stuff drunk on a daily basis. its arguably australias most famous beer - piss off fosters - and is certainly the most popular. theres hardly a pub where you cant find it either in tap or can/stubbie and the words to the jingle are more well known than the lyrics to the national anthem (is it girt by sea or gird by sea?)  you either like vb or you dont. theres no room for sitting on the fence with this beer. its either something more sacred than holy water or if your mum was on fire you wouldnt even use it to try and extinguish her. i used to hate vb i used to hate the bogan connotations that came with drinking this beer. i used to hate people who drank it. i was a downright snob and used to look down on people who drank it - especially religiously. but my palate is diversifying and lets give it a go to see if i still hate it or whether its something that is at the very least tolerable.  look: this is going to be my 11th beer review and all but 2 so far have been aussie adjunct lagers. i will get to the better beers eventually. poured into a pint glass weve got a lovely honey gold liquid clean filtered. a thin finger of foam has accumulated at the top but it didnt froth up. its a little darker than your standard aussie adjunct lagers and it actually looks more appealing.  smell: the classic aussie adjunct lager smell. heavy earthy grassy notes come courtesy of the pride of ringwood hops sweet pale malt slightly sour. am i overreacting by saying the sourness almost smells like orange peel? i remember thinking it used to smell offensive. i no longer do. it just smells classically australian.  taste: malty sweetness nice bitterness. getting that grassy citrus peel flavour coming through on the bitterness. smooth easy drinking. flavours are mellow but prominent. subtle sour tang with a dry finish that makes me want another sip. slight adjunct taste but not overly powering.  feel: fairly highly carbonated which makes it convenient to slam down that ice cold beer. ice cold it is extremely refreshing. body is medium  overall; either ive lowered my expectations or ive diversified my palate and im no longer a snob. i cant hate this beer any more. im not saying i necessarily love it but i have grown to appreciate it. its a part of australian culture and its not going anywhere soon. its certainly more drinkable than i remember it and whilst i probably wont go buying slabs of this stuff i certainly wont hesitate to go for it if im at the pub and theres nothing else worth drinking.  will say the beer has to be drunk cold. ice cold. you cant afford to let these warm up. once its creeping up to room temperature the bitterness from the hops seem to curdle and you get all sorts of nasty flavours going on. thats where i think most people go wrong with vb. its simply not served cold enough. most lagers should be ice cold and ice cold is where the respectable flavours come out to play. once it starts warming up grab another one or just drink em quicker.
6893,Victoria Bitter (VB),2,2004: (375 ml bottle in norway.) sweetish orange-like aroma. the flavour is mostly bitterness - more than in fosters and castlemaine but not really pleasant. will not be a regular beer of mine this one.
6894,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.35,sure its just another commercial lager but with it comes good memories of a broke youngster partying at the local rsl hence the higher score. one thing it has going for it (for an average to sh*tty lager) is that its slightly heavier in taste not a totally watered down commercial lager as many are. would i recommend it probably not but if youre in oz have a few just to blend in:)
6895,Victoria Bitter (VB),1,disgusting.
6896,Victoria Bitter (VB),4.65,this is my favorite beer after satanic chimp from monkey paw. i understand why so many people hate it i just like that. unfortunately i havent been able to find it in the us. maybe its nostalgia for drunk port visits back in my navy days. (im trying to get my list together.)
6897,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.46,ive had it numerous times in pint glasses stubbies straight out of the can even off the ground on one drunken evening. it tastes average at best regardless of what you do with it. its a middle-class beer thats supposed to be pounded on a hot summer evening after a hard days work in the trenches or from your couch.  the look is like any other dime-a-dozen lager that classic piss-yellow tint. the smell has hints of alcohol and rice. the taste is well i dont know; like a budweiser but with more tang. the feel is below average. very carbonated and watery.
6898,Kronenbourg,2.75,march 2002: average french lager - easily drinkable but kronenbourg 1664 is better..... probably still my opinion today but its been years since the last time i bothered to buy it.
6899,Kronenbourg,2.69,not a gourmet beer but cheap and made too have good times with your friends in front of a nice rugby game.
6900,Kronenbourg,2.55,one of the local options in the strasboug alsatian scene and one of the big five french beers of the 1970s kronenbourg was probably the best of the big five and definitely the most popular and prevalent in paris at the time. though the alsatian/strasbourg scene was the best of france it never compared with all that was going on across the great rhine river.
6901,Kronenbourg,2.78,trying not to bring back any euros i picked up a couple more beers to finish off my french trip. this one was cold.  it is a yellow lager with nice lacing. the aroma is faint but not funky. the taste is thin and slightly sweet. the aftertaste is non-existent.  not recommended. its not worth your while.
6902,Kronenbourg,2.51,500ml keg at au rendez-vous des artistes montmarte paris (€5): quite a light looking beer but one that sits nicely in the glass with a decent looking & quite fluffy textured head that also had good retention. the nose was definitely basic with some slightly skunky notes & a little corn showing in the early going followed by the odd vegetable adjunct. the taste of the beer was similar to the nose with some corn & a light sweetness alongside some faint bitterness & the odd malt. it was very much a macro pale lager with moderate carbonation & a crisp slightly dry finish but it wasnt one id hurry back to.
6903,Kronenbourg,4.05,kronenbourg original has a thick mousse-like white head a bubbly golden clear appearance with lots of white sediment throughout and heavy glass lacing. aroma is of banana white bread crust and white bread toast. taste is similar with sharp hop bitterness. mouthfeel is light to medium and kronenbourg finishes medium dry.  rjt
6904,Kronenbourg,2.79,very average lager; intrigued because its from france but besides being refreshing on a hot summer day there isnt much that i can say about this beer. i wouldnt seek it out again. very light (4.2 abv) very little smell that i can discern. nice head and lacing which generally maintained throughout. drink this if you are sweating on a hot day and you need to get rehydrated. :) otherwise not worth it....reminds me of bud light.
6905,Nillerzzzzz,4.44,look - black and thick with a fantastic tan rimming and lacing smell and taste - so much barrel booze chocolate and vanilla... in that order feel - thick and creamy with a light carb overall - pretty fantastic for being from 2018 and drinking in 2023
6906,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.9,#172 fantastic!
6907,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,5,phenomenal. poured cold to a glencairn glass. dark burnt caramel color minimal fuse-fast head. aroma is unexpectedly heavy prune with a base of leather and light vanilla. first sips are laden with bourbon bite i mean a heavy hit of hot but enjoyably sweet spirit. the barrel wood is forward bringing images of saturated staves oozing booze and tannins. i don’t even know the abv but it’s easy to kick back a big swig…though i only have this one lonely can to enjoy. mouthfeel is full with a nice stickiness. the caramel bites are all over the middle and end flavors. it carries traits similar to a stout/barleywine cuvée like anchorage’s endless endings wherein there is a dark malt middle flavor once the sip is gone and you’re enjoying the linger. i also find it similar to fremont’s b6k but with a much more subdued and harmonious sweetness profile. next time i’ll try to get a 4-pack. i had a meeting that day…in hindsight it was with an asshole so my time would have been better spent ordering beer online.
6908,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.91,poured at fridge temp. drank over the course of half hour to get full array of how this beer would taste at different temps. just great bourbon / vanilla / raisin notes on the nose. high expectations heading in and the flavor did not disappoint. booze is well masked; heavy flavors of toffee vanilla maple dark chocolate and bourbon.  fantastic bevvy.
6909,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.47,clear dark ebony pour opaque in the glass; thin light tan partial ring sitting atop the beer. big dark grain nose; heavy sweetness; tobacco; subtle dark chocolate. intensely rich flavors; licorice and brown sugar; blackstrap molasses; whiskey; earthy spiciness. heavy chewy body; dense residual sugars; sticky; boozy warmth.  this dense and complex beer exudes depth and intrigue with its rich flavors and aroma.  pouring temperature: 44 °f; canning info: 12-29-22 source: @chicagoj
6910,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.14,pours clear and amber in color with nice head and good lacing. getting pine and orange aromas which are fairly strong. very nice tasting and a beer that you can enjoy drinking a lot of. not as nice as the lengthwise zeus imperial ipa but definitely a very excellent quality beer. getting malt and hop tastes i feel that if it had a little less bitterness it would taste way better. it is very smooth in the mouth and feels thick.  overall a very high quality beer and i definitely plan to buy more of it.
6911,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.24,ipa is my go to style and hop presence is important but thats not to say the more the better and the most hops wins. balance is extremely valuable so it matters that the grain flavor isnt covered by the bitterness so using more grain for a stronger ale requires more hops and this one does that in great proportions.
6912,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.14,not as dank as i was expecting from the can but thats no bad thing. pours dark clear amber. mild carbonation. instant scents of pine florals and citrus. taste follows but with maltiness and subtlety. its very mellow for its abv and dangerously drinkable. lovely stuff.
6913,Torpedo Extra IPA,3.82,poured from a 12 ounce can into a teku glass.  look- medium amber moderately hazy cream colored frothy head above average head retention average lacing.  smell- pine resin biscuit clementine floral medium strength of scent.  taste- biscuit pine resin clementine high strength of flavor.  feel- medium body high bitterness mildly astringent average carbonation moderately creamy.  overall- medium amber with moderate haze and cream colored frothy head. bouquet predominantly malty with pine resin and some citrus notes. flavors were overly malty with pine resin and mild citrus character. body was medium with mild astringency and high bitterness. overall this beer was much to malty for the abv in my opinion. the flavor was strong it just wasn’t one that match my palate preference.
6914,Torpedo Extra IPA,5,this is and has been my go to beer for several years. i have tried many many ipas some were good at first but did not taste as good later. it has the perfect balance of hops and malt. full bodied yet not overpowering. still my favorite ipa.
6915,Torpedo Extra IPA,5,one of my favorite everyday ipas. it checks all the boxes and is just a really delicious ipa. love the higher ibu.
6916,Torpedo Extra IPA,2,while i find the original sierra nevada pale ale to be quite flavorful and refreshing the torpedo extra ipa was just too much for my tender lil guy taste buds not for me. way too harsh not enjoyable.  style: ipa | tap/can/bottle: bottle | abv: 7.2% | rating: 2
6917,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.49,fab.yellow brownish in color. pines in smell balanced by sweetness. the taste is bitterness of hops balanced by sweetness of (caramelized?) malt. sharp finish. light body. so drinkable and enjoyable. a great take on ipa.
6918,Expedition Stout,4.59,i cant believe i havent reviewed this one yet. had at least 10 bottles of this over the past few years. bottled 9/14/21. just about two years old. a perfect aging.  the pour yields a thin line of dark brown foam. it quickly fades leaving a ring around the glass.  nose is right down the middle russian imperial material. roasted malt brings notes of dark chocolate dark fruits brown sugar and the slightest bit of soy sauce. you can tell that this brew will be incredibly animated just from a first glance.  taste follows through but bringing even more. roasted malt smokiness dark chocolate dark fruit slight caramel brown sugar or perhaps even black strap molasses. wonderful stuff. the bitterness on this one is just perfect. reaching high points but never overwhelming or obtrusive. the flavors still fly true almost urged onward by the bitterness them working in tandem. everything working together to create the final product.  mouthfeel is fullbodied almost pillowy. has heft and density to it with just the slightest bit of cloying. very mild carbonation. the mouthfeel delivers the flavor perfectly.  overall this is easily one of the best russian imperials you can buy. in eternal cellared stout beer fridge staple material along the likes of sierra nevadas barrel aged narwhal old rasputin and founders imperial stout. a brew that demands respect.
6919,Expedition Stout,4.43,12 oz bottle into a snifter. deep dark brew fine proud brownish foam. aroma of cafe cubano dark roast malt stone fruits. taste hits like lightning with notes of dark chocolate prune coffee and a pronounced bitterness all in perfect harmony. great long and chewy finish the hoppy bitterness last to exit. full body mouthfeel. medium carbonation. overall a superb well made classic ris for the people!
6920,Expedition Stout,4.75,poured from a 12-oz bottle dated 9/7/22 shelf life — unlimited and purchased at the brewery last month into a stout glass.  appearance: opaque/black with a massive dark tan head that lingered a very long time and left beautiful lacing.  nose: very complex: dark roast a bit of coffee sweet dried fruit brown sugar -- oh my!  mouthfeel: thick and creamy.  attack: bitter as you would expect from an ris — but absolutely well-balanced and very smooth — deep dark roast chocolate dark fruit sweetness a little coffee.  finish: the bitterness from the dark roast as well as from some hops lingers and lingers very nicely.  overall: theres a lot going on in this fantastic ris; few beers are this well balanced. certainly not a session beer at 10.5% abv but more drinkable than just a sipper. im having a hard time coming up with anything i dont like about this beer. i understand that my rating numbers are very high for this beer — and higher than the average of other raters; i truly think its worth these scores.
6921,Expedition Stout,4.36,bottled 9.7.22 (debated waiting til the one year mark but you can all see how that went)  poured into a nh to tulip at fridge temp and warming up.  pours dark brown nearly black with a dark mocha head. 4.25  lots of dark and fermented stone fruit on the initial nose whiff smidge of coffee and cocoa. 4.5  taste follows boozy bitter (more hoppy than coffee) dark fruit and heavy. 4.25  body is thick boozy warm heat syrupy and heavy. everything id expect from a ris. 4.25  overall a true ris if ive ever had one with the perfect amount of butter hops and deep complexity. 4.5
6922,Expedition Stout,4.48,poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. thick beige head abundant lacing dark brown nearly black color. aroma of chocolate and dark roasted malt. mouthfeel is thick with a warming alcohol in the finish. flavor is intense - chocolate molasses dark fruit dark roasted barley with matching intense hop flavors. overall: if you like big intense complex beers this is definitely one to try.
6923,Expedition Stout,4.18,original review from years ago accidentally deleted. updated review:  canned 2021 (2 years ago)  appearance: pours a completely black color with a moderate and thick dark tan head. srm of 24. (4.00)  aroma: strong and smooth aromas of rich dark chocolate somewhat bittersweet with a sweet bourbon bread and caramel flavor. (4.00)  flavor: dark smooth rich and sweet flavors of dark chocolate rich bread caramel strudel some scotch and bourbon to finishes malty. minimal roast. (4.25)  feel: heavier bodied average carbonation. smooth thick rich heavy and sweet. (4.25)  compared to great lakes blackout stout 2/2023: pours similar darker head. similar aromas. more thick and heavy chocolate with malt complexity of bread pudding and caramel. less coffee and roastedness. heavier and sweeter.  overall: tried this one a few times and unfortunately my review was accidentally deleted so cannot look back on previous reviews. now im drinking this one from 2021 in 2023 so aged a couple of years. its rich heavy and thick. some complexity to the malt flavors of chocolate dark meat bread pudding and caramel. shows the booze a bit. thick heavy and sweet.
6924,Expedition Stout,4.32,deep black pour with a small brown ring that is hanging around. roasted malt nose with a decent amount of ethanol. super smooth perfectly equal creamy and a bit of carbonation. delicious classic stout.
6925,Expedition Stout,4.5,12 oz bottle packaged 9-7-22. i’ve had this many times. first time review. poured into a snifter a beautiful thick black with a 1” head. smell is hard to tell. a little too cold being in fridge don’t have the greatest nose. taste is great. full flavored chocolate a a little licorice. very hearty. feels great in the mouth. almost chewable. i like to sip these over a long time and let them warm up. one of my favorite russian imperial stouts. highly recommended.
6926,Expedition Stout,4.44,purchased a bottle of this beer while in pittsburgh. poured into a tulip glass. richdark brown with a beautiful cream brown head and excellent lacing. smell and taste of high quality dark chocolate. earthy and very malty mellow warming and slightly boozy. very silky smooth. creamy feel. very nice stout.
6927,Expedition Stout,4.26,expedition stout from bell’s brewery. 12 oz bottle. stored at 34 degrees at home. received from @whyteboar in nbw bif #16. reviewed 16/12/22. note that i use dd/mm/yy protocol. bottle marked on back label “shelf life – unlimited” also “pkg 09/20/2022). served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried jester king snifter. the final temperature was 56.1 degrees. appearance – 3. first pour – amber brown (srm 18) nearly opaque. body - ruby brown (srm 24) opaque. under direct light same. when rear lite opaque but some light penetrates the edges – ruby. head – average (maximum one cm aggressive center pour) copper high density quickly diminishing to a 0.15 cm crown with a thin partial cap. lacing – none. aroma – 4.5 – medium roasted malt with light char and hints of chocolate no hops no yeast. flavor – 4.5 – flavor follows the nose – roasted malt slightly bitter no hops no yeast. no ethanol (10.5 % abv as marked on label) aroma or taste. marked gastric warming occurs. no dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. palate – 4 – medium slightly creamy soft carbonation. final impression and summation: 4 looks like every other ris. flavor is typical for the style without the coffee notes many ris have. aroma is also typical.
6928,Expedition Stout,4.54,due to abv split this 12 ozer with my son in law. dark dark dark in color. exceptional taste up front and nothing weird on the finish. abv disguised so well it’s crushable but at your own peril. will cellar one or two from this sixer. well priced at 16.00 for six
6929,Hopsecutioner,3.51,8/2023 sam’s club
6930,Hopsecutioner,3.94,one of those beers of fame that i somehow have not had until now a draft pour an iconic beer but it probably meant more when its peer group was smaller. the first thing ive had from terrapin in way too long nice beer but in some ways it has a ton of equals now everyone caught up perhaps. looks like they used to lightly brassy to copper mostly clear with some low shine a fine almost inch of thick and lasting white head craggy and rocky and leaving lace as it drinks. it smells like minerals from the malt a little crystal malt richness but still american tons of relatively fresh hops wrapped into it grapefruit for sure could be simcoe driven spicy northwestern vibes too orange zest cantaloupe and pine its resinous and it seems to be bitter but its not overly intense as they go at least by todays standards classically balanced and without anything from the yeast. the flavor is similar grapefruit for sure white pine boards tangerine herbal bitters and actual high alpha hop bitterness set against or rather alongside and together with slightly nutty pale barley malt sweet like toffee but for just a flash in the middle then bready and baked and in a support role. this is really nice fresh in this instance and with some linger. it plays in that iconic space lagunitas ipa and the like drinkable for its strength and because its got great proportionality but it also didnt hit me in this day and age as something real special either good but just an ipa not being critical it just seems familiar. good to get to drink some terrapin stuff i always forget they have corporate ownership now...
6931,Hopsecutioner,3.88,12 oz. can best by dec 07 2023. acquired the 6 pack from the janesville wisconsin woodmans. ironic how beer brewed in georgia is available in wisconsin yet i never see it in illinois but i digress.  a: pours a nice burnt golden / orange strong finger point five of frothy sudsy off-white head. looks float-ish. color is nice reminiscent of how they used to make ipas... s: earthy twiggy grassy. not overly hoppy or piney or resinous despite the six hop varieties that went into this. notes of caramel & bready biscuit malt. t: the taste is nice but surely not designed to break or crash any new ground. bitter slightly piney good balance of bread malts. its simple but nice. f: decent feel. smooth creamy. body feels super light especially for being over 7% abv with the alcohol being not noticeable at all.  overall i would call it slightly above average but definitely decent especially in these days where hazy swill lines all the shelves.  terrapin hopsecutioner -----4/5.
6932,Hopsecutioner,3.5,tastes like a pepsi-cola.  style: ipa | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 7.3% | rating: 3.5
6933,Hopsecutioner,3.95,appearance: clear gold thin white head with moderate retention  aroma: citrus herbal and pine.  flavor and aftertaste: citrus herbal and pine. aggressive bitterness. low sweetness.  mouthfeel: drying low to moderate carbonation. high stringency. moderate length finish with sticky trailing bitterness.  overall: wc style ipa. lands with a compliment of citrus herbal and piney aromas and flavors. pretty aggressive bitterness that is coating and lasts well into the finish. uses warrior chinook simcoe centennial and cascade hops.
6934,Hopsecutioner,4.2,look - golden small white head no lacing left behind smell - bready piney citrusy taste - citrus pine caramel fruity malty feel - medium light body moderate carbonation hoppy sticky finish overall - hoppy malty backbone caramel sweetness and fruity. mouthfeel is a bit light. theres a piney resin and fruity candy flavor on the finish. great job by terrapin using six different hops to create a solid west coast ipa. thats why i paired hopsecutioner with going back to cali by sevendust. heavy duty!
6935,Hopsecutioner,4.19,look: pours a copper shade of deep golden amber with a generous two finger off white head foam. laces the glass exceptionally well.  aroma: pine tar the kind youd put on a baseball bat. some sweet notes of granola and orange peel in the background. a little bit of lemon peel and pickled ginger.  taste: decently bitter but not to a gobsmacking degree. follows the nose. good amount of pine resin and bitter orange upfront followed by chewy notes of caramel and granola. ends on more spicy pine resin with just the slightest hint of orange taffy.  feel: mid-heavy body. somewhat chewy and thick. dry.  overall: solid ipa.
6936,Hopsecutioner,4.12,old school wcipa. nice.
6937,Hopsecutioner,4.02,pours out of the can a crystal clear copper with an inch of head with good retention. smells of sweet malts slightly floral and the taste follows the nose. very little bitterness and a solid full mouthfeel. not too complicated but nothing making this a bad beer by any means.
6938,Hopsecutioner,3.95,appearance: pours an orangish amber color with an off-white foam head. leaves behind some lacing.  aroma: semi sweet biscuity malts dark fruit and tangerine(ish) aroma. a little earthy.  taste: ripe orange citrus spice. a malty backbone.  overall: this is unique to say the least.
6939,Hopsecutioner,3.9,can pour into a tulip glass. gold amber appearance with a moist sticky head. citrus and apricot nose fruity malty flavor. full body good carbonation.
6940,Cafe Y Churro,4.07,canned on 1/1/22; consumed on 1/31/22  pours a foggy burnt orange body topped with just over a finger of fluffy white foam; solid head retention leaves islands of creamy cap along with a moderate frothy collar and a generous spatter of spotty lacing spread around the walls of the glass.  aroma features creamy vanilla amplifying the sturdy cream ale base as it absorbs fresh diner coffee with a touch of cinnamon grazing for nuance; a clean composition for a vivid and evocative bouquet.  taste shows a hint of vanilla and fresh coffee bean as cinnamon edges coffee roast on the mid-palate building to a residual presence of sweet corn and bready malt lingering past the finish.  mouthfeel offers a medium body with moderate-low fluffy carbonation dispersing creamy textures into a roasty tingle over the mid-palate; a level silky character maintains with a subtle grit progressing into a cleaner finish.  maybe the most direct of the series these adjuncts flow seamlessly into the base regular coffee scheme presenting a coherent image of cinnamon infusion countering a naturally sweet and creamy underbelly while maintaining the taut balanced drinkability paraamount in the style.
6941,Cafe Y Churro,4.32,canned 1/1/22  alrighty we’ve landed at our final destination in this horizontal tasting the #1 rated cream ale. this one is definitely the most low key in terms of adjuncts of all the ones i’ve sampled this weekend but maybe its beauty lies in its simplicity. let’s see if it’s worth of such high praise  pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  well the cinnamon definitely gives this one more of a presence in the nose but it’s equally smoothed out by the vanilla. i’m picking up on aromas of creamy coffee earthy cinnamon coriander french vanilla doughy malt honey and light toffee  this is also quite good in taste the cinnamon makes itself known but doesnt overstep. on the front end of the sip im tasting cinnamon bark light roast coffee sweet cream vanilla light white pepper and nutty malt. the swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon acidic coffee coriander nutty malt vanilla caramel and light cream  a medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a smooth beer. finishes mostly dry and dries even more over time because of the cinnamon. probably the most drinkable of the series because of this  this was one hell of a ride through adjuncted cream ales to get me through a blizzard! this one and coffee & pavlova (kiwi + strawberry) were definitely the frontrunners of the series. worthy of the title and im excited to try more variants in the future. in the meantime ive had enough of the style this weekend time to get to some other beers i picked up from carton
6942,Cafe Y Churro,4.44,appearance - the beer poured a golden color with visible carbonation and a white head.  smell - cinnamon and some coffee are noted in the nose. it was obvious that this beer had some spice.  taste - oh my! regular coffee is obvious but the spice of the cinnamon sparkles. with the hint of cinnamon it really created the idea of drinking a churro. the cinnamon is not overdone or a mess of spices. i believe the beer could benefit from a bit more cinnamon spice. the coffee profile was not overshadowed by the adjuncts. especially in the finish.  mouthfeel - the body was so smooth even with fairly aggressive carbonation.  overall - i think i like regular coffee the best. however this is my favorite variant.
6943,Cafe Y Churro,4.13,thick slightly hazy orange with a .5 inch excellent lacing throughout. nose is sweet cream light malts touch of vanilla but didn\t catch any cinnamon. taste follows with rich milk and cream notes rounded malts small amount of hop bitterness to even it out. whiff of cinnamon on the finish but very slight for me. feel is rich and creamy with no hint of the 12% abv. a remarkably smooth beer with the only knock being the elusive cinnamon.
6944,Cafe Y Churro,4.56,thank you y2kawakami for this 12 oz can dated 12/15/16 poured into a teku  a- a slightly hazy copper with a small white head.  s- cinnamon some coffee caramel some vanilla. smells like a churro with some coffee.  t- cinnamon some vanilla coffee caramel touch of chocolate.  m- smooth medium to full body.  o- wow carton nailed it with the churro flavor. very easy to drink.
6945,Cafe Y Churro,4.25,pours a somewhat opaque burnished orange color. thin off-white head dissipates pretty quickly leaving no residual head. appearance appears to be in line with the style.  aroma has notes of coffee vanilla light cream notes and a lovely bouquet of cinnamon. the cinnamon is just delicious.  taste follows the nose with notes of coffee and vanilla up front all interspersed with some lovely cinnamon notes that linger through to the finish. its sweet but not overly so.  feel is light not exactly crisp but its clean. semi-dry finish.  overall this continues the series unique take on the cream ale style. the cinnamon and vanilla in this one are outstanding though. definitely my favorite example of the coffee series ive had.
6946,Cafe Y Churro,4.09,wow this is quite the interesting one. looks still as cider in the glass. its rare that coffee works well in a pale ale but this is one of those times. the sugary toasty churro character comes through nicely to balance things out. almost like a coffee barleywine but also kinda reminds me of pumpking?  82/100
6947,Cafe Y Churro,4,dark amber brew with an off-white head. minimal production and ok retention. body is lively; despite the activity and deep color its perfectly transparent.  coffee cinnamon and vanilla on the nose. decadent and rich; sweet and inviting. just a bit of a cream soda note going on.  flavor follows: sweet creamy and smooth. cinnamon provides a large portion of the flavor accents and the vanilla blends smoothly with cream and coffee notes. less bite than other amber coffee ales (or coffee cream ales). quite a dessert beer.  creamy body very smooth and drinkable. no sense of the high abv until you notice the heat building in your throat.
6948,Cafe Y Churro,4.56,pours a golden color with a half finger of quickly disappearing head. the nose is cinnamon coffee vanilla and some caramel. the taste follows the nose vanilla cinnamon and coffee with some bitterness on the finish. low carbonation smooth and easy to drink with a creamy mouthfeel. the 12% is not noticeable.
6949,Cafe Y Churro,4.4,transparent copper with a finger and a half of foam. head is off-white in color and is well-retained. aroma is cinnamon vanilla bean medium-roast medium-bodied coffee and nutty earthy caramely malts. sweetness right up front with just a sliver of coffee bitterness bringing it back to balance. flavor profile is cinnamon vanilla bean medium-roast fruity bodied coffee and nutty earthy caramely malts. sweetness starts and closes out the flavor profile with a light bitterness from the coffee striking a modest balance in the center. alcohol is well hidden in the flavor profile which is rather surprising considering the 12% abv. mouth feel is lightly crisp with a velvety medium-thick consistency beyond it. overall sugary sweet with a good hit of coffee. balances leans heavily towards the dessert side which is to say - overall this thing is sweet. the fact that the alcohol is well masked boosts the rating here just slightly.  served in a 15.5oz spiegalau tulip from a 12oz can.
6950,Cafe Y Churro,4.39,can you be in cuba and mexico at the same time? with this beer you can. tastes of a sweet cortalito but you enjoy that with a freshly fried churro from mexico city. if you like coffee and desserts this will win you over.
6951,312 Urban Wheat,3.75,12oz can. date stamp on bottom is 02oct23. cloudy pale gold colored body. two fingers of white head retreat to make a cap and ring. leaves behind scattered strings of lacing. aroma of wheat and floral/citrus hops. taste is bright and crisp. flavors are wheat malt some yeast and citrus hops. aftertaste is of short duration. medium mouth feel. a little drying. good carbonation. easy drinking beer with an acceptable not objectionable taste profile.
6952,312 Urban Wheat,3.8,i personally like the redesign hardly the reason i tried these tho had first time at a cubs game in the club tried something new… nbsoc; a new generation ‘miller or meister brau’ when purchased fresh this actually is a great american beer. aroma and flavor provide some cascade hop resin and millennium bittering add a lot of character to this very drinkable beer! a lot of people hunt for ‘dry hopped orange juice’ beer i personally prefer a hoppy lemon grass flavor and that comes nicely with this beer. head starts as a great blossom good for this style dissipates sort of fast but does not effect the whole experience if anything drinking it with head into drinking it with no head is part of what adds a hazy character and some dynamic interest to the glass when drinking a deceivingly simple beer. minimal malt presence and small noble hop spices draw this style back to a more traditional result as well as some actually quality feeling wheat a lot of elements add to the presence and quality of this beer.  definitely will drink again and would recommend for summer gatherings personal recommendation to anyone just trying to have a good beer without a lot of thought and at a great price point! tell ‘em colossal cascade hops sent ya! hahahahaa
6953,312 Urban Wheat,3.41,i think the cans look dumb but the pour is light and it tastes like a solid hoppy wheat beer. overall not bad.
6954,312 Urban Wheat,3.44,on tap streeters tavern off campus of loyola april 2023. tasty that beckons for one (or two) more.
6955,312 Urban Wheat,3.47,good for summer. overall the smell and taste is kind of simple and not aggressive. look: clear golden color smell: lemony aroma taste: light watery smooth not offensive little to null aftertaste
6956,312 Urban Wheat,3.12,i know i have had this many times and was surprised it remained unreviewed (at least by me). flavor is kind of thin but does have some tartness and citrus notes. unfortunately the carbonation strangles the early flavor after which the aftertaste is watery and kind of fizzles out. just not close to what im looking for in a wheat beer.
6957,312 Urban Wheat,3.5,a light refreshing summer offering. it doesnt quite come off as a wheat ale. a subtle lemony citrus character with a light biscuit flavor. very crushable and good for what it is
6958,312 Urban Wheat,3.51,slightly hazy straw yellow with a modest and short lived white head. the aroma is crackers and a hint of lemon. the taste is fresh biscuits hints of banana lemon and cloves. the body is light/medium good carbonation level smooth and very drinkable. altogether this is a refreshing and enjoyable wheat ale. should be good for a warm summer day.
6959,Landbier,3.82,clear straw fizzy small white head. medium-poor retention.  smells sweet slightly funky a fruity note i cant quite place. a hint of cocoa?  pop of sweetness upfront. corn cracker malt hay hint of lemon and pineapple peppercorn touch of grass. corn sweetness with some rye-like spice and a musty mildew note. crisp and clean and slightly dry finish.  solid lager. complex but crushable.
6960,Landbier,4.43,16oz can into a tall lager glass. l: pours a yeast hazed light straw pale yellow w a 1/4 bright white rounded head lrg carbo bubbles head goes to flat semi thick skin random skeletal lacing. s: fruity berries yeast lemon a hint of bread dough light funk pear. t: doughy white fruits pear white grape light kiwi lemon zest pie crust very light pineapple but not acidic pale & fruity with yeast throughout. f: persistently brisk light-bodied feel w a snappy dry med-length finish and a lightly zesty linger. softens up over time and becomes very smooth and lightly more dense. excellent. o: an elegant tasting and masterfully brewed lager. fruity with some bready notes. light airy and ez drinking lots of flavor & phenomenally well-balanced. it is outstanding in its style.
6961,Landbier,4.08,pours clear golden with a frothy head. the nose is bready malty with a touch of earthy spices and a touch of toast. clean and crisp light bodied but with a firm bready and slightly toasty malt presence. balanced effectively with earthy and grassy hops with notes of citrus. they did a nice job making it interesting and flavorful within the style.
6962,Landbier,4.51,a sturdy pour from a 16-oz. can yielded a finger of soapy white foam that slowly became rocky and then shrunk to a lasting cap leaving behind thin rings of lacing. clear dull yellow straw color with extremely small rising bubbles.  a perfect blend of bready (dough fresh baked and toasted) malts and floral hops greets the nose. grain and grass with some apple juice and a hint of citrus featuring lemon join in.  neutral (at first) with average bitterness as in the taste bready malt and floral/citrus hops prevail. a little juicy but not as much as the smell suggests. a faint kolsch-like white wine taste appears. the end of the taste is semi-dry but not crisp bitterness rises a bit with added spice. the finish is a quick and even withdrawal of all flavors except for briefly lingering hops.  very light bodied with plenty of lasting carbonation exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. in spite of the light body and lowish abv a thin but sturdy malt backbone exists. again i must mention the smooth and clean finish outstanding. warms well and remains lively carbonated throughout.
6963,Landbier,4.1,poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass; bron on 09/08/22. pours light yellow with minimal to no foam. sweet almost grape like taste with subtle hops. a bit thin but refreshing and delicious.
6964,Landbier,3.76,the pour is a clear & pale golden yellow. the taste is honey mild lemon mild earthy & piney hop notes & white cracker. this beer reminds me more of a german pilsner. cheers! b
6965,Landbier,4.28,pours crystal clear golden color with a fairly rocky white head that falls to a ring and rafts. lots of little suds marks on the glass.  on the nose i get...ummm...strawberry. yup...no doubt. floating high there are floral notes that are fairly perfume-like hay herbal and earthy. nice mildly toasty grainy smell like a rustic bread holds this all up. mild citrus eventually shows and a very mild spice note.  the taste is... well it actually does strike me as somehow rustic. like this is a beer that could be from any period in history. bread lightly toasted nutty grains fruity/floral citrusy lime earthy green hay. a perfect level of hop bitterness and a little peppery tannin thing going on. there is a pleasant underlying sweetness.  the feel is light smooth rounded. carbonation is fairly high clean crisp flavor delivery nothing lingering.  this is an outstanding beer. full of flavor and very well-crafted. light easy drinking. this is a beer you could drink any time - it hits the i just want a beer thing yet the flavors and how they are layered - you can think about it and pick it apart or just chill and enjoy drinking a really good. worthy in every respect.
6966,Landbier,4.45,16oz can poured into a lager glass.  a: dull golden color with perfect clarity. two fingers of bubbly white head settle after a time. thin sheets of fine-bubbled lacing form coarse rings.  s: very interesting nose. floral/perfumey/fruity are the general top notes. juicy vibrant and almost tropical. strawberry was included in their tasting notes and i have to say my mind does go there too. juicy strawberry is front and center whether or not i was subliminally induced to think so. bit of floral and lemon/lime hop character. subtly herbal and earthy. great rustic grainy character too- earthy and toasty.  t: mostly follows the nose. very unique fermentation character is what stands out most. very floral and juicy with a bit of yeasty nuttiness. hop profile balances with a lot of lemon/lime flavor a soft herbal/earthiness and just a dash of gritty bitterness. off-dry overall. grain base is mildly coarse toasty and earthy/sweet- what i associate with spelt. hay and bread crust too. it is these toasty/nutty grain flavors that linger on the finish along with a bit of limey hops.  m: light bodied round and firm malt textures with a bit of creaminess. scrubbing carbonation is on the aggressive side. mild gripping tannin.  o: i very much enjoyed this lager. its truly different and ive never experienced anything quite like it. the real attraction is the newly-unearthed weihenstephan yeast which introduces a memorably fruity and playful fermentation profile. i do love how well it plays with the spelt notes and stays perfectly clean and drinkable. im not sure what schilling plans to do with this beer but id love easy access to it. if you love to geek out about old-world lagers you need to seek out this beer and drink it.
6967,Antarctica Pilsen,1.63,269 ml can drinking in a glass. thin persistent foam leaving laces. terrible metallic notes and of cooked vegetables. watery no smoothness. only its powerful advertising strategies may explain why it sells so much.
6968,Antarctica Pilsen,2.25,a 355 ml glass bottle served at 6° c poured into a pokal glass. clear light yellow color with a poor head. faint aroma with a hint of grain. taste is similar to aroma nothing exciting. watery with a medium carbonation. rather short and faint finish.
6969,Antarctica Pilsen,1.19,look: clear and undertone gold color without sediments; very low foam formation with very low persistence; smell: smelless none at all; taste: fleeting malt taste without expression none aftertaste; feel: very low carbonation watery; overall: very light pilsen beer without expression in all directions drinkability 1+/5+.
6970,Antarctica Pilsen,1.75,its almost like drink water
6971,Antarctica Pilsen,1.5,
6972,Antarctica Pilsen,2.75,350 ml can in belem - 4.9%    nice looking white head dies down to a partial coat rather quickly but still leaves good lacing.  fine-grained carbonation is visible carbonation in the clear light golden body.  feel: light lively body with crisp medium-high carbonation.  semi-dry finish.   taste:  typical light lager with hints of cereal as well as light malts and a touch of hops. mild but lingering aftertaste more clearly reveals the hops.   smell: faint cereal and light malts with a touch of spicy/herbal hops.  o: about average for this style in this area. certainly not worth seeking out but passable.
6973,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.09,2017 vintage. enjoyed on 05/14/2022
6974,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.25,2018 vintage; consumed on 1/11/22  pours a clear jet-crimson body with sharp blood-red highlights and topped with a finger and a half of creamy pale beige foam; sub-par head retention fades to a few spotty paper-thin islands of cap a large frothy collar and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.  aromas of harsh ripe whiskey breed burnt sugar smoked butterscotch and caramel and a decadent prune/plum compote; shreds of whiskey umami and soy varnish make way for floral oak barrel carrying vanilla icing against potent bourbon lingering as a final impressor.  taste shows burnt sugar and toffee swirled into fig syrup upfront with plummy esters lingering through the mid-palate to a bourbon back end leaving a dusting of cocoa to finish.  mouthfeel offers a medium body with minimal carbonation and a semi-oily viscosity maintaining a slickness into the mid-palate; a char is intertwined in a mild tannic twang with incredible subtlety on the back end of the palate where a piercing encompassing warmth peaks into the finish.  cresting at the potent richness of boozy barrel peaks ascendant dark fruit jams near umami status against an unrelenting spirit and fresh oak barrel interplay; structure and detail at the highest levels of barleywine.
6975,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.71,for purposes of this review the 2014 vintage was sampled.  appearance - the beer poured a rusty red color with a few white bubbles crowning the top of the glass.  smell - the nose was a sweet bready barleywine with hints of bourbon. this pretty much nailed the expectation.  taste - the profile had the appropriate level of sweetness. there were notes of raisin tobacco orange rind big caramel and a nice mild alcohol burn at the finish.  mouthfeel - the feel was smooth almost slick with carbonation largely faded.  overall - this is fairly old school but it is still elite.
6976,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.63,vintage 2018 - quite low carb which really accentuates the rich oily body of the beer. there is a ton of thick caramel to the beer - sweet but nicely balanced by malt and hops. smooth zero trace of the abv with a surprisingly clean finish. the nose isnt powerful but very accurately communicates the rich toffee and caramel of the beer.  sofa king good. highly recommended.
6977,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.5,drinks smooth w/o strong fusel presence but warms the insides and clearly swings above 14.5%.  absolutely still a slightly translucent dirty amber. no head leaves transparent sheeting on the glass.  smells of oxidation--sweet toffee sherry the library attic light unsweetened peanut and faint marshmallow--and a curious crab apple/orchard rot undertone.  taste follows nose: sherry brandy orange liquor old books faint peanut and marshmallow and drying crabapple on the finish. drinks like 18% but in a wonderful way--so close to a fine spirit yet just far enough away to remain drinkable and assert itself as a beer.  kuhnhenn bros strike again!
6978,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.52,pours an amazing ruby red with a head that dissipates immediately. smells is super spicy. i would guess this was aged in a rye barrel if it didn’t specifically say bourbon. it’s a sipper. 14.5% drinks like 80 proof. it’s a monster and a masterpiece.
6979,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.24,winter solstice 2018. drank in winter spring 2018/2019. forgot to write details.
6980,Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,4.45,500 ml bottle into a snifter. bottled 7/20/21 had 3/12/22.  pours an opaque dark brown with a quarter inch quickly dissipating head and some spotty cling. aromas of bourbon oak char malt chocolate some vanilla a little leather. has a spicy peppery aroma. flavors of bourbon oak malt vanilla chocolate raisins char a little licorice on the finish and in the aftertaste. has a spicy taste somewhat black pepper like. smooth a very good full body appropriately carbonated.  really enjoyable. lots of barrel and oak many distinct and expressive aromas and flavors. not quite as full bodied for a bcs effort but it’s not a negative.
6981,Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,4.75,this beer pours a perfect onyx black with zero leakage on the edges and sports a dark tan head that is a bit creamy and sticks around for a surprising amount of time given the 16% abv. a gorgeous representation of an imperial stout.  the nose is boozy up front again no surprise with the high abv but there’s also huge milk chocolate caramel vanilla oak and stone fruit (as ripe dark cherries ) notes that literally have me drooling. there’s a lot packed into this big beer.  the taste has a nice boozy note up front that is not distracting at all and flows into the milk chocolate caramel vanilla oak and dark cherry flavors with a nice warming alcohol note at the back of the palate. this is perfectly balanced and world class at the highest level imho.  the mouthfeel is full substantial and coats the palate. this is everything a ba imperial stout should be again imho.
6982,Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,4.39,opened my bottle of this with a friend of mine who had the elijah craig toasted barrel bourbon so we could try them side by side. the beer pours much like any bcbs rich dark black color with a thin brown head on top. the smell has a pretty healthy barrel presence to it some roast and chocolate in there too. taste is solid nice chocolate mixed with bourbon and wood notes. the feel was personally my favorite part of the beer it was smooth hardly any boozy heat the fact that it was 16% and drank so easily is very impressive. overall its a great beer as it should be. enjoyed having it!
6983,Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,4.9,#152 really enjoyed this!
6984,Broo Doo,4,bottled 9/9/2022. the first thing that comes to mind is ipa flavored. this is solid all around from start to finish. there is nothing special to me that marks this brew but if i saw this available on tap i\d be thrilled. medium to thick bodied on the palate. sticky hop bitterness with a mix of pine and citrus. if you know you dont like ipas then this will not change your mind. but! if you know you like the style then this is one to throw into the mix of options. i generally prefer a lighter flavor and mouthfeel but i do like this beer.
6985,Broo Doo,4.24,12oz bottle. etched on bottle neck is \bottled 09-09-22\. seasonal 2022 release. notes on label: broodoo harvest ale is a seasonal ale that glorifies american hops. broodoo is brewed using fresh green wet hops picked right from the vine and put into our beer vats from vine to brew house in one day! enjoy!. slightly cloudy pale gold colored body. one finger of creamy white head. partial sheet of lacing on non-drinking side of the glass. aroma is resin hops citrus and pine. taste follows the nose and presents as a good malt base flavored with grapefruit and pineapple with a good undercurrent of pine. long lasting hop dominated aftertaste. medium plus mouth feel. crisp and sticky. very good carbonation. presents as a top notch fresh hops brew.
6986,Broo Doo,4.15,6 oz mini-snifter draft pour at lures bar & grille. this is an excellent wet hop ipa with aromas and flavors of citrus and pine atop a caramel malt base. the 7% abv is well-hidden. next time i will definitely need to get a full pour/bottle of this beer.
6987,The Peach,4.34,never giving up on those childhood snacks de garde takes the influence of fruit rollup and rolls it into a winey earthy tart and spicy wild ale. with lambic influences at the helm at well this fruit rollup is corked capped and ready for adulthood.  pale gold and lightly of chrome the light and yeasty haze of the peach teems with bubbles while building a loose necklace of foam. pulling from its white wine appearance the session kicks of with a plume of stone fruit over a citrusy tangy earthy briney perfume chocked full of both funk and fauna. as its mild mannered sweetness greets the tongue the suggestions of communion wafer sourdough and a hint of tafffy gives a soft and wheaten buffer to start.  as the malt sweetness bounces effortlessly from the palate the tastebuds soon carry the brunt of acidity that pangs away with lemon lime white grape crabapple yuzu and passionfruit with a stronger acidic twinge. all the while the peach character gives a melon-like roundness for a smooth stone fruit taste. nearly apricot mango and orange-like the bright and ripe peach flavor is radiant. trending peppery with dry oak and lightly bittered hops hints of grapefruit grape seed and a mossy earthiness provide an earthy and peppery exit from the palate.  light crisp and highly refreshing the off-clean ale finishes briskly acidic with a series of short sourdough echoes laced with peppery white wine saddle leather and oak tannin.
6988,The Peach,4,2022-12-25 750ml capped/corked bottle served in a pair of little cantillon stemmed glasses. bottled 10/21.  pours clear light golden with a small ghost of a head that disappears and leaves a tiny ring around the glass. smell is tart and funky. a bit of wood some dry chardonnay. something musty. very interesting.  taste is dry tart very chardonnay buttery peach / stonefruit notes are there but kind of drowned out by the woody / chardonnay notes. tartness is somewhere between unripe peaches and lemons. mustiness is some combination of the butter and wood notes i think.  mouthfeel is medium to light super dry slight filminess gives a sense of liveliness that might just be prickly acidity. overall its good and very interesting.
6989,The Peach,4.37,cloudy yellowy orange body white cap settles into a collar quickly. big peach nose big barnyard funk lesser so horse blanket funk oak more than the cognac support but both there slight floral notes too. tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach apricot lemon green apple all support but finish doesnt elevate rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. feel is bright sour decently acidic cumulatively and funky almost feel more vinous on the finish. very nice peach wild ale. the 6th best? no but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch
6990,The Peach,4.94,#129 taste like peaches as advertised. good stuff!
6991,The Peach,4.5,holy peach!!! love peaches in sours and this one is absolutely loaded with them. pours and smells great and it tastes like a darn peach bomb. unbelievable sour!
6992,Very Hazy,4.63,quite certain ive had this one before but apparently never reviewed. yeah its decent! i lack the flair with my superlatives these days to detail the nuances. if you can get your hands on this one do so.
6993,Very Hazy,4.34,pours like opaque guava juice with a 2 finger creamy off-white head that faded extremely slowly and left really nice lacing on the glass. it smells like tangerine orange juice papaya tropical fruit dank citrus hops faint biscuit a hint of caramel and some flowery spices as it fades. the flavor was very similar to the nose with tangerine orange juice papaya tropical fruit and the additions of peaches lemon zest and citrus hops that have off the dry hopped vibe. more malty backbone in the taste with sweet grains biscuit chalky yeast graham cracker and then spices like coriander or white pepper in the finish. the bitterness level was perfect and the taste completely hid the abv this indeed was very hazy and very tasty overall.
6994,Very Hazy,4.68,4/30/23 canned 4/19/22. what more could you ask for in a neipa? as good as any i’ve had. as advertised.
6995,Very Hazy,4.47,pours like straight up juice with one finger of eggshell colored head.  s: citrus & tropical fruits nose couldve been better. nice head retention & lacing  t: grapefruit kiwi fruit grassiness pineapple & dryness up front. lime peaches oranges & pineapple as this beer warms up acidic notes from the pineapple some grassy notes as well. finishes with pineapple & orange plus limes  mf: medium body fairly restrained carbonation carbonation goes creamy as this warms up; nice balance  very nice take on the style just got better as this warmed up. if everything else was equal to the flavor i would rated this higher
6996,Oude Fermier,4.68,2020 vintage. mostly clear yellow pour with a fat finger of eggshell white foam spotted lacing. i went in skeptical here but actually i must admit this is top shelf! smell capture a myriad of oak nuances catching fruit: peach orange lime white grape and green apple as the most defined add a hint of dandelion and must to round out. taste takes it a step further: honestly sps best non-fruit wild saison if not their best saison period. add passion fruit pear and a whisper of grapefruit to the fruit from the nose oak is now toasty and bright vinous kiss adds layers in a gentle way floral tones are more generic compared to nose though must and funk elevate. feel is bright sour sneaky funky oak backing is refined and dries out well through the sip with controlled acidity dotting the palate very dialed in.
6997,Oude Fermier,4.42,an enjoyable saison. 2020 vintage enjoyed in a tulip at a creve coeur mo courtyard. dry oak white wine appropriate level of funk but refreshing with citrus notes and the right level of sour. ive heard that this vintage wasnt as good so definitely didnt live up to the hype but i still found it fairly enjoyable.
6998,Maximus,3.66,malty and sweet too sweet for me honestly. almost reminds me of a hoppy malt liquor. little to no alcohol burn goes down easy. not my favorite.
6999,Maximus,4.03,aroma is a reliable pine and stonefrui flavors a great follow-up. bodys a solid no-complications bitter pine stonefruit and cantaloupe. this is straightforward and strong a good everyday drinker.
7000,Maximus,4.03,delicious and noteworthy for how well balanced is as the brewery notes. lovely deep golden color with a healthy itinerant head. pretty straightforward nose here dominated by hops. this also has powerful hop flavors that are craftily balanced with sweet bready malts. a little thin on the mouthfeel maybe. really really tasty and gets right on top of you thanks to the well masked alcohol notes in the 9-percenter.
7001,Maximus,5,i am in las vegas bought a 19 oz can for 2.99 at the abc store. very good beer and i really like the sweetness and 9% alcohol. will definitely have this again! great beer!!      a
7002,Maximus,3.5,too strong and too bitter for me to drink in one sitting although there is a faint sweetness that i enjoy.
7003,Maximus,4.51,great taste mouthfeel and finish. a 9.0 double ipa 12 pack for 20 bucks? how could you go wrong? best value in beer
7004,Maximus,4.7,ive been trying all the different beers at the walgreens at penn station ny. i pick up a few and have them on my commute home on a njtransit train to my home in middletown nj. today i decided to give lagunitas maximus a try and i glad i did. i tried a few of their beers an i like this one the best. it packs a wallop at 9.00 apv and consider it coats only 2 for $5.49 its a good value. this ipa has a strong taste an is worthy to being called an ipa with its pungent hops and bite. this beer type is not for everyone so if you like coors or miller please stay away because its got too much taste for you. for what you get its amazing.
7005,Maximus,4.15,its like a tripel thats an ipa: fruity good alcohol taste good buzz....ya its a nice malt/fruit backbone to the ipa flavors. 8/10.
7006,Maximus,3.9,i\m coming across a bunch of backlog beers that i\ve had and somehow missed logging years ago while looking at the most popular beers list. this is one i remember enjoying a good bit but being a bit sharply bitter.
7007,Maximus,3.91,picked up a tallboy can with a date of 03/07/23.  pours an amber copper in color with a finger thick head of frothy foam that leaves lacing on the glass as you drink. carbonation looks average with small bubbles rising from the bottom. theres plenty of hop residue left in the beer from the dry hopping process. looks to be pretty balanced.  balanced on the nose as well with rich roasted malts and lemon candy hops. lots of fruitiness in there though a bit hard to distinguish notes. maybe some blood orange and mango as it warms. theres a bit of a sweet/sour thing going on as well. its not overly aromatic surprisingly.  definitely hop forward but remains pretty balanced on the tongue. roasted malts dominate up front giving way to the fruity citrusy spicy hops towards the swallow but remaining throughout. picking up notes of apple pineapple and cherry. the finish is surprisingly mild with some roasted malts and pine on the tongue. not picking up any alcohol until perhaps the final swallow.  mouthfeel is medium bodied with a solid amount of chewiness and subdued carbonation which works quite well. the finish is pretty dry. it does coat the tongue a bit over time but is surprisingly not much of a palate wrecker. dangerously drinkable at 9% abv.  havent picked up anything from lagunitas in awhile thought i would give this one a shot. it definitely has the profile of a classic double ipa well balanced but also pungently hopped. theres a lot of complexity to savor here as well especially as the beer warms but its also quite drinkable. im not a huge double ipa fan i have them only occasionally but if the style is part of your rotation this one is sure to please. a very solid offering. cheers!
7008,Maximus,3.65,look: pours a slightly orange shade of yellow with a one finger rocky head of off white foam. below average lacing. moderate head retention.  aroma: the nose is fruit punch like - with notes of sugary orange pineapple juice and sweet cherry. sort of anemic and weak i really have to stick my nose deep down in the glass to get much of anything.  taste: surprisingly not as sweet as the nose would let on and strangely well balanced for such a strong imperial ipa. reminds me of a dole fruit cup. upfront im tasting some nice notes of bittersweet toffee and dry caramel. midpalate is rounded out by some nice tropical flavors of pineapple juice and tangy/sweet orange juice. theres a brief flash of shredded coconut and sour cherry. the finish is bitter and resinous but not overpowering ending with restrained notes of pine sap and a slight spicy garlic note.  feel: alcohol profile is slightly noticeable. mouthfeel is slightly oily and sticky but not sugary. dry/fruity. a touch on the heavy side but not decisively so. carbonation level is moderate.  overall: this is very fruit cocktail like (probably the mosaic hops) it\s not exactly my style but i enjoyed it. the first time i tried this beer a year or two ago i didn\t like it at all and thought it wasn\t even worth rating or reviewing. after having decided to try it again i was pleasantly surprised how my taste has changed. this isn\t anything life changing or mind blowing but i\d recommend it if you\ve never tried it and are looking for a strong imperial ipa that isn\t to that slap you in the face level of hop intensity and bitterness.
7009,Miller High Life,2.78,might be the best cheap us mass-market beer. for the price pretty ok. it is actually almost just as good as some micro-pale lagers that local microbreweries are producing as nostalgia beers now now days but for half the price.
7010,Miller High Life,3.09,great cheap beer american style. too much corn but balanced with some acidity and carbonation. not offensive. one of the better cheap american beers. and it has been around a long time which states a lot.
7011,Miller High Life,3.42,poured transparent honey amber color and was topped by a tall nearly white dense head of foam. aroma lost on my covid damaged nose. the taste was not really strong enough for distinct flavors but the malts definitely carried the load i found no noticeable hops influence. still for an aal it isn’t too bad. the feel is great actually active carbonation keeps it lively and refreshing. oa there i gave it a fair shake. maybe this will be the last one i drink it’s certainly the last one i will buy.
7012,Miller High Life,5,gods nectar. go to beer for a $6 beer and shot. when i find it in those little nipple glass bottles i am feral . perfect
7013,Miller High Life,1.61,this is a beautiful looking beer. it is well carbonated and keeps a frothy white head. these are its best qualities and beyond then it is truly an awful beer. it has no malt character and almost no bitterness (i would guess about 6 or 7 ibus). the aftertaste is carbonated water. on the bright side this is the beer that is going to help me cut down on drinking.
7014,Miller High Life,1.73,tastes like maize and co2. basically a corn-flavored seltzer.
7015,Miller High Life,4,back in my early 20’s whenever i would drink at home instead of going out to a house party or a dive bar miller high life and budweiser were my go to beers. the taste has a rich creaminess to it at least that is what i get out of it. i also love the design of the bottles it is a mixture of classy and cheesy that really appeals to me however i do prefer the taste out of the can more. one of the most satisfying bottom shelf beers you’ll find it’s miller high life “the champagne of beers!  style: american lager | tap/can/bottle: can | abv: 4.6% | rating: 4
7016,Miller High Life,3.25,i have three guilty beer pleasures: pabbs blue ribbon coors banquet and miller high life. these are the beers that i drank in college and concerts. have very fond memories. they arent craft beer and they dont label themselves as craft beer. great times!
7017,Carling Lager,2.74,i buy this in summer and keep in the fridge at our cottage. good to drink instead of water and to serve in quantity to my kids. not horrible and usually one of the cheaper brands. always available at the store. a go to for summer hot days when we can chill outside on a hot day.
7018,Carling Lager,3,meh not bad
7019,Carling Lager,2.35,draught
7020,Carling Lager,3.68,i guess people are rating the beer poorly because its not a style they like. they really did nail the style except the nose may have been a little too grainy. also the beer was right up against expiration and had a slight oxidation taint.
7021,Carling Lager,3.18,completely solid canadian style adjunct. ive written about this in the past and i think that canadian adjuncts should be considered the own sub-category although im far too illiterate to explain what exactly that would entail. i do know however that the majority of canadian adjuncts ive had that arent sold stateside (molson export labatt 50 etc) have a richer flavor and creamier body than most american adjuncts with even loss hop presence than their american counterparts and a warmer embrace of cereal nodes.  this is a good example of the style though not as good as labatt 50 or molson ex. firm cereal start crisp and lightly sour middle light finish with a creamy body throughout.  i dont know where this falls into the (sub/super)-premium tier of the ontario beer market or if such a tiering system even exists outside of the us but id say this would compete well against the pabst/bud/coors segment of the american market. if you absolutely despise macros then of course you wouldnt like this (and i dont see why youd bother to rate it).
7022,Desperados,3.03,i did not expect to have something like this while in belgium. this clear burnt golden beer was served with a lime in its somewhat gaudy bottle much like a corona. lol.  drinking the first few sips after removing the lime it kind of reminds me of tequila barrel aged turbo shandy in that it has a bit of a honey character that comes off stronger than the botanicals and is a little on the sweeter side. theres perhaps a touch of toasted corn far in the background but its pretty one note...thus the lime.
7023,Desperados,1.94,poured from a 330ml bottle.  pours dark straw with a tight bubbled head and high carbonation. the smell is soapy weirdly sweet and citrusy and the taste follows on . the sweetness is so off-putting they use glucose syrup in this and you can taste it strongly . it is also somehow unpleasantly bitter in a chemical feeling way . the mouthfeel is mostly syrup and fizz . overall why is this popular? probably fashion and a pretty high abv . its like a bad lager mixed with a sprite with tequila in there somewhere but its all gone wrong .
7024,Desperados,1.73,appearance: pours a golden crystal clear body. no appreciable head formation as it instantly crackles away like a sprite.  smell: the d smells of four generous pumps of raunchy tequila-flavored syrup into a low-grade cheapo lager.  taste: quite sugary - artificial lime and tequila additives abound. there seems to be an unenjoyable beer underneath but its difficult to discern beyond the tequila lollipop candied deal. long loonnggg aftertaste with a weird chemically twang and final pop of artificial sweetness.  mouthfeel: thin-bodied. soda pop-esque carbonation kinda fizzly.  overall: unpleasantly sweet remorselessly chemically.
7025,Desperados,1.11,this is the worst beer ive ever had. i have nothing positive to say about it. like cheap macrobrews get poor reviews because theyre boring and uninspired. this isnt boring or uninspired but i really wish it was. i imagine this is what it would taste like if you mixed mikes hard lemonade with a busch light that was left out half finished the morning after a frat party. also a hint of cough syrup. just truly disgusting.  the look is fine i guess. fine enough that i thought this purchase could possibly be a good idea. darker than one might expect probably artificially colored if i had to guess. the nose is stale and sweet. a little malty. the taste is like a collaboration between flavors that hate each other. again stale and sweet. slightly acidic maybe like citric acid was added or something. i dont detect any tequila flavors. none of the vegetal qualities that define tequila. honestly i dont think this is even beer. closer to a flavored malt beverage but i would pick any flavor of four loko over this.  only try this is if youre curious about how bad it is.
7026,Desperados,1.43,you have no idea how much this is being drunk here in the netherlands. skunky and sweet. smells awful and tastes like bitter induced bad lemonade. awfully popular among my friends and peers no idea why.
7027,Desperados,1.55,from a can purchased in france. clear golden color with white head. sweet corn aroma. medium body. tastes like sweet grain with a side of cheap tequila. had this several years ago but it\s still memorable as the worst beer i\ve ever had. seriously just drink a better beer and then take a shot of tequila. it\ll be more enjoyable that way.
7028,Desperados,1.56,someone who invented this had to be on solid drugs! worth mentioning that if someone from higher position who really tasted that in heineken and said like: “yeah well that’s something we really have to produce and send out to the market” - they should have get rid of him. mixing beer with tequila isn’t obviously a good idea and it completely ruins what i see in beer. well someone could like but not me. the flavors don’t work out together for me and are a chaos. it literally tastes like some messed up radler. sewage dishwater - dump it!
7029,Desperados,2.52,sweet hell is there a hell? if so this is what they would serve on tap there. nah it ain’t that bad… but is it? in reality it tastes more like soda than beer - which is about as cool as a soda tasting like a beer when raul was a tyke. nope!  be well my children.
7030,Desperados,1.81,the first words out of my mouth were holy shit what were they thinking?  sugar buttered toast sugar and more sugar on the nose. mouthfeel is not insubstantial but nothing special. tastes like someone mixed budweiser with sprite added a few drops of tequila and a feckton of sugar. i had to add some guinness to make it palatable—and even then i couldnt finish it.  cannot recommend this frankensteins monster of a bier.
7031,Desperados,1.33,desperate. this so undrinkable for any beer-lover. perhaps the worst beer in the world alongside corona and cubanisto. truly awful. stay clear from this stuff.
7032,Desperados,2.09,didn’t want to rate this as a beer despite the deceptive “lager” appearance. although upon closer inspection the carbonation is nothing like a true beer. it’s more like a wine cooler. if you look at it that way there’s less sugar in this...drink...than a wine cooler so not too awful. came close to pouring this down the drain but something about it kept me wanting to drink it. will not buy again despite the cheap buzz.
7033,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.46,9/8/23 on tap at chilis in uniontown pa. visited after our first lymes disease trial shot.  not much in the nose considering the decent bready banana wheat spice notes.  i consider this a nice decent average mass produced witbier.
7034,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.73,24 oz can acclimated to 48°f and poured into a tulip glass.  pours hazy the color of apricot juice nice color. produces a 1 finger white head dissipating quickly and leaving lacing that fades quickly.  initial aroma is orange peel and juice with some yeast slight note of hay maybe? after agitating im hit with a funky and cooling smell that reminds me of sea spray.  initial taste before swallowing feels like it hits the same receptors as salt its juicy and yeasty with a peachy and apricot taste. after swallowing i first taste a peachy/fruity/nectar/juicy taste. i then notice a fermented/bread/dough/yeast taste that seems to grow in intensity when the other tastes fade. in the aftertaste is a bitterness that i dont find pleasant sort of a rotten vegetable taste.  mouthfeel is rather juicy feeling heavy and somewhat sticky but not syrupy. dare i say silky. its the proper descriptor but implies a little higher quality than id call it.  overall its good for the price. its not amazing and its not got many layers of flavor but it satisfied me well enough. i did enjoy the yeasty bread taste quite a bit and the mouthfeel was impressive. would be a decent session beer if kept at the recommended temperature and not allowed to warm too much.  not likely to buy again ive had it in the past but wanted to try again maybe in several years like i did this time. i might but whatever.
7035,Blue Moon Belgian White,4.6,smells like faint over ripe bananas. taste is a floral orange blossom with a pinch of coriander anise pumpkin seed and white flower amalgamation.
7036,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.66,uk brewed version. poured from a 330ml bottle this beer is very cloudy light orange  an inch thick tightly bubbled head forms bit is short lived and leaves no lacing  highly carbonated looking. the smell is of yeast fruit and light malt and the taste follows this with the addition of the classic  for this style  addition of orange and coriander. its slightly sweet and bitter in a nicely rounded way and has a nice mildly dry finish . very fizzy with a good viscosity. overall pleasantly surprised. the flavour is rounded if a little too mellow but its overall tasty and refreshing. not as good as hoegaarden used to be better than the glucose syrup laden stuff it is now .
7037,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.48,probably the best mass produced beer very easy to drink and decent abv.
7038,Blue Moon Belgian White,1.22,terrible. ill tell you why. it tastes like sun tan lotion literally. banana boat sunscreen.
7039,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.66,500 ml can from bilkatogo denmark. abv is 5.4%. hazy yellow colour large white head. wheaty aroma hints of coriander and orange peel. smooth mouthfeel. citric and wheaty flavour a hint of coriander. low bitterness. refreshing.
7040,Blue Moon Belgian White,4.04,great summer beer
7041,Wee Heavy,4.35,2022. bought for ~13$ at alesmiths brewery in san diego ca for a beer tasting with my buddy ron. just a few quick notes because during these tastings i dont spend too much time writing.  a&s: not much head on this one. brown black colored beer. the aroma is sweet with hints of oranges.  t&m: very easy to drink. the taste is peet black licorice and butterfingers. medium mouthfeel and carbonation.  overall: i would recommend it.
7042,Wee Heavy,3.97,a 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz. foiled and capped bottle with no clear bottled on or best before date. poured into a snifter glass.  appearance: a cloudy amber copper orange colour with very thin beige head that dissipated quickly while leaving some lacing.  aroma: dark fruit prunes caramel toffee booze with a light roast and a hint of chocolate.  taste: sweet malt light roast caramel toffee dark fruit prunes brown sugar with light notes of chocolate.  mouthfeel: medium to full bodied with light to moderate carbonation.  overall: a nice sipper with good flavours.
7043,Wee Heavy,3.68,750 ml bottle kindly shared by abemorsten. abv is 10%. very dark ruby colour nearly black. low beige head. aroma of malts dark dried fruits / prunes and caramel maybe a hint of smoke. very rich and malty flavour again with caramel and prunes and maybe a hint of smoke. powerful stuff.
7044,Wee Heavy,4.19,look - dark brown muddy color with a slight film rim smell - sweet caramel booze with some fig taste - a lot like the scent feel - a lot of body light carbonarion overall - great tasty beer. a lot like a barley wine
7045,Wee Heavy,3.67,had this when i was visiting the old brewery. pours a dark mahogany and chestnut brown almost leaning into black territory. we\re talking ~ looks similar to an imperial porter at this point. tan colored head 3/5. good retention. solid looking beer. the aroma is a mixture of earthy malt toffee bitterness booziness and mild smoked caramel sweetness.  taste is chewy but not thick. more of that brown and smoked malt (in a minor way not rauchbier levels) aspect. mingles some dark fruit like influence. mouth feel then gives more nuanced complexity in that you start getting more of a nuttiness angle to compliment all the other stuff. moderate heat which means at a double digit abv it hides the alcohol decently. thinner body than the appearance and taste would seem to indicate normally. carbonation on point. this seems like a good candidate for an evening around a fire especially campfires.
7046,Wee Heavy,4.35,probably my favorite wee heavy. perfectly balanced nice and boozy just the right amount of sweetness and not overly malty. this is one of my go-tos when visiting alesmith and it remains a menu standard because of its consistently world-class brewing. good stuff.
7047,Maple In The Wood - Double Barrel-Aged,4.91,#wickedbeersideprojectshare2021. in my opinion on another level from the single barrel bourbon maple in the wood. great complexity from the added barrel with a distinct richness from the maple and contrasting barrel heat on the tail. excellent.
7048,Bavaria 8.6 Original,3.05,march 2006: 650 ml very dark blueish green bottle bought in france. abv is 7.9%. golden colour large lasting head decent lacing. malty and fruity aroma with some alcoholic notes but not unpleasant. hints of oak and leather. flavour is very sweet but surprisingly it is not as repulsive as many other (often less sweet) golden strong lagers. tolerable hops obviously contribute to a (nearly) acceptable balance. moderate carbonation. i’ve had worse beers.
7049,Bavaria 8.6 Original,1.53,the local bottle shop near me stock some of these strong european lagers which are good on a friday night when you want to get your buzz on and not think too hard about the present future or past. theyve started stocking this one so thought id pick up a can and give it a go.  look: clear very bubbly golden beer looking like a classic australian adjunct lager rather than a typical pale euro lager. frothy white head that has more important places to be than my glass by the way its disappearing as i type this.  smell: strong alcohol whiff on the nose bitter grassy hops somewhat sour on the nose biscuit malt. smells like a hangover in the making.  taste: sweet syrupy goo. its like theyve poured a lot of simple syrup and mixed it with straight alcohol. struggling to find anything positive about the flavour might be some hop extract in there somewhere but if it is theyve mixed with with simple syrup and turned it into a hop cordial.  feel: smooth not overly carbonated but sickly sweet.  overall: 20th review and this is the first one im proper regretting. ive had oj strong and from memory thats more palatable this is just beer cordial. i look on the can and sure enough it lists hop extract and glucose syrup. 1-2 cans may get you buzzed but heck id rather drink a 6 pack of an average aussie adjunct lager than force myself to down this. better drink it ice cold because once it warms up its going to be completely undrinkable.  in a word: yuck!
7050,Bavaria 8.6 Original,2.43,if your on holiday in europe and you want quick buzz this is your beer.it looks good price reasonable and tastes ok.def the pick of the strong cans.obvs big supermarket will provide better but not always option.
7051,Bavaria 8.6 Original,2.39,taste like metallic piss but oh boy if you want to get drunk i defenitly recommend. rsaiste will understand
7052,Bavaria 8.6 Original,5,one of the greatest beer i ever drank. only two and youll have the best night of your life. the first sip can be weird but you cant stop drinking it. its really cheap and the can is beautiful. about the taste well it gets better sip after sip ! just try it and stop consider it like a low beer only for homeless people. trust me guys !
7053,Bavaria 8.6 Original,1.43,blond in color with a frothy white head that lasts several minutes before breaking. 2.25  smell is sweet malts caramel and breads along with a tin can smell. 1.75  taste is remarkably sweet given the style. the sweet malts overpower just about anything else. 1.25  feel is lightish and the carbonation is medium. the metallic smell from earlier is now an unfavorable aftertaste. 1.25  another giant cup of nope. i dont know how people can drink this beer. sweet malty mess with a metal aftertaste? no thanks. 1.25
7054,West Coast IPA,4.29,12 oz can enjoy by date 10/24/23 into a pint glass. l: pours deep amber honey color with a 3/4 crusty frothy off white head that has vg retention very light carbo some sticky lacing. s: caramel malts berries citrus pineapple mango fairly floral. t: caramelized malts citrus ripe orange grapefruit berries melon black tea leaves honey a hint of bread has a slightly resinous finish that retains a bit of sweetness. f: soft smooth med-body with a slick & glassy middle and a mellow med-long finish that is lightly drying. o: a lovely tasting beer with excellent balance. it has a light touch of honey throughout and has a very light resinous quality. incredibly easy drinking for its abv. it is outstanding in its style.
7055,West Coast IPA,4.27,pours golden yellow with white foamy cap and light notes of pine and back notes of citrus grapefruit and floral. really nice classic ipa.
7056,West Coast IPA,4.17,look: ruby-red and nearly clear with a bountiful off-white head that settles to a lid leaving good lacing behind aroma: grapefruit – both white and ruby-red pine sap and needles a little cannabis wafts of berries and some sweet onion taste: pine hits hard up front and develops as citrus and some berry notes follow closely behind and weave in nicely. fruity and lightly skunky cannabis notes appear as the pine/citrus subsides and onion stays in the background throughout. closes with a bite along with more pine and grapefruit mouthfeel: full lightly slick medium-high carbonation and moderate dryness on the finish overall: this is delicious stuff. this beer got me into simcoe hops 15 years ago and i used to drink it all the time until it ceased being bottled and distributed in the state. glad to see it still gets tapped now and then and was a nice surprise birthday gift from my boss
7057,West Coast IPA,3.93,from a can. amber color with an inch of white foamy head. earthy pine smell. medium body with some stickiness. earthy pine flavor with some grapefruit notes. solid wcipa.
7058,West Coast IPA,4.02,only photos could describe the foamy white mess that rises above the top of a clear glass liter mug. it’s that pathetic. really no beer pour especially an ipa should ever have this much stark white starchy foam pretending to be a head. this is the consequence of trying to fit two twelve ounce cans contents into the vessel. with patience the foam recedes and there becomes almost a true beer head. obviously there are concerns as big white foamy and starchy heads often lead to taste and mouthfeel disappointments. the aroma is of ok piney hoppiness; but so far its looks over aroma and looks have a big negative lead. the color isnt the problem. its a rich and bright dark amber thats close to being translucent. actually its a pretty good looking brew once the head recedes. much as expected this is a nicely west coast hopped rendition without much of a malt inclusion to carry it via its body nor to give it a counterbalance so necessary for a great ipa. the ratings here may be inconsistent but that sums up the brew. theres good color but bad lacing. theres a nice sharp piney hop bite but no malt balance nor backbone. this isnt bad and the tastes of those that want hoppiness even at the expense of a malty presence will like this. to taste its a nicely dry hopped ale. to anyone that loves a traditional ipa the lack of barley malt in the mix will spoil this.
7059,West Coast IPA,4.18,slightly hazy rich amber appearance with a generous fine bubbled head that left rings of good lacing. big time piney resinous hop aroma some citrus with an initial hit of sweetness that fades after a few moments. medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. the profuse amount of hops engage the palate from the start well into the lingering long lasting finish
7060,West Coast IPA,4.3,from a 12oz can dated 12/13/21 into a pint glass.  pours a translucent brownish orange with about a half finger of with head (gentle pour). ok retention and lacing.  smells of fresh cut grass and pint. also got a hint of marijuana.  piney resiny bitter taste. 95 ibus in their glory-right in the wheelhouse for a wcipa. some malts in there as well-bit of caramel.  very sticky mouthfeel-full bodied. strong bitter aftertaste. medium carbonation.  this is a wcipa. hit the mark squarely. and stinking enjoyable too.
7061,Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier,4,pours neat and clear light gold. immediate notes of yeast banana bread. slight phenols to follow nose with mild pepper in after taste. remarkably complex given the style. interesting.
7062,Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier,4.24,7/9/23 poured from bottle purchased at save on beer north of pittsburgh.  beautiful clear deep gold. little to no head or lacing.  aromas are definite banana clove and lilac. (the lilac according to leah.... something floral anyways). slight malt as well.  immediate carbonation on the tongue. banana bread not sweet not sweet though. picking up some walnut tones. picking up some metallic background along with some bitterness of citrus.  overall a nice drinkable kristalweissen!
7063,Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier,3.78,glass into imperial pint look: clear gold color pouring a 1/2 finger head which quickly dissipated leaving lacing and thin ring smell: doughy malt and yeast. lemon zest taste: very doughy malt with some yeast funk. fades to lemon bread. feel: light body moderate carbonation crisp finish overall: its really good. very easy to tell how the filtering effects the hefe weissbier
7064,Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier,4.22,clear light yellow with a foamy head. smells sweet and fresh. taste follows. sweet freshness. soft bodied. watery which this beer embraces perfectly. very light in bitterness. amazing fresh beer. definitely one for the upcoming summer days.
7065,Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier,4.21,a clear gold color small white head scant lacing. aroma of bread banana. spicy. taste of clove banana bread. a little late pepper. medium-bodied easy to drink.
7066,Pale Ale,3.28,in a bind taste test i wouldnt guess this was a gluten free beer. in fact my guess would be coors banquet with just a touch more hops. like banquet its corn forward and slightly cloying but overall inoffensive.
7067,Pale Ale,3.88,gluten free pales and ipas are a struggle. these are not easy brews to make. this is one of the best i have had as it would be an pretty good beer if you did not know it was gluten free. overall i believe they did a very good job on this brew.
7068,Pale Ale,2.34,crystal clear color of light gold. brief one-finger head. absolutely zero lacing on the glass.  the smell is dry malt with a caramel touch. theres a bit of cardboard to the nose as well.  high carbonation level with not enough body to balance it. despite this this beer is too sweet cloy even. there are overtones of apricot and caramel but it isnt appealing--too dessert like. the hop is nearly nonexistent which is unfortunate since this beer needs balance. think double bock without the body or rich malt presence. a clear miss.
7069,Pale Ale,1,if a 0 was possible i would have given it such. this is easily one of the worst beers i have ever tasted. i had to actually pour it down the sink and i think it worked better as a drain cleaner than a beer. dont waste your money.
7070,Pale Ale,1.24,awful. tastes like plastic. oh my god was this bad. like pour it out bad. i cant even cook with this stuff. avoid at all costs.
7071,Pale Ale,2.06,it looks nice but not a solid gf option.
7072,Pale Ale,1.51,no thanks. really strange. i need more words but i cant
7073,Pale Ale,2.69,very carbonated. nice gf substitute. but there are much better options if you are not gluten intolerant.
7074,Assassin,4.79,appearance - the beer was an inky black color with a dark head clinging to the sides of the glass.  smell - dark malts and barrel were the primary parts of the nose.  taste - initially the profile was thick boozy dark chocolate. the profile with sweet but nowhere close to being cloying. notes of raisin tobacco and a hint of vanilla followed. the chocolate goodness lingered in the aftertaste.  mouthfeel - the feel was thick and sticky clinging to the sides and top of the tongue.  overall - this beer was definitely hype worthy.
7075,Assassin,4.46,a: a carbon black discharge to the carafe with a tap shoe hue while the decanter rests on a woodsmoke tone before the radiance pins a coloration near kurotobi. the transfer(s) occur across natural nucleated sites which avoids the unwanted lipids/impurities on the cross-reactions for solidifications. accordingly a collar formation to the inch as latticework – marginally – pushes through a rushed retreat. the brim comes in towards the .25in which clings to the periods that reach 1cm while the hours further the detachments per the foam-negative materials. with this in mind the palette to the neck has a dark beige peak as the rushed retreat has a mars brown rim. in turn a viscosity factor that plays to the annulling properties aforesaid which support the nuanced droplets that attune the advanced (teary) arches  s: malts frame the dexterities above a soft hop bill while the oak casks work to build a complicated mass around the aged aldehydes. an ignition that politely connotes la bête noire\u202fwith a cajeta\u202fglaze as figgy duff pairs alongside prunes + flame raisins. there is an oak stave to plank presence in exercise which adds a dynamic balance to the sweet midsections. supplementary to this a calm hop effect that reinforces the barrel toned landscapes when symbolizing forested alder to shagbark hickory. all the while a ventilated deduction on the vintage beyond the bettering cask aspects. this comes at a trained interval which nears ≥68°f for softening & blooming the – hourly – abstractions. correspondingly an enlightened (smart) complication that comes without additives where the stability is maintained & rooted through coordination. the progression optimizes the breathing periods by characterizing palo cortado through rawhide over clay pipes outside the dried fruit subtexts over atomic fireballs. moreover a structure that continuously engages in complex polymers when denoting lignins across tannins in the act of rolling dry constitutions  t: soft barrel entitlements to the conversions set by diastatic enzymes where hemicelluloses contribute to the cultured caramelization(s). namely maltol developments to the plot for signifying doughy accounts on nussbrezels under a crème brûlée guise as bourbon coats chelan cherries + moyer plums. the notations have a light implication on the makings that analog malvabons while lightly addressing the oak lactones thru coconut. the age offers a refined sense on the phenolic aldehydes as they lend vanilla by vanillin which comes with a molasses – charred – nature. howbeit cautious to not exceedingly burn amid the oxidized transfers across the carafe where fahrenheit gets incrementally pushed. there is a leathery standing behind the hydrolysable workings which offer a steadying composure to the sweet malt passages. this is furthered by a low toned bitterness when detailing the dark rosin inflections. sequentially a blooming allowance that recapitulates the sensed perceptions on sherry where an oxidized nuttiness supplants english toffee. the sequences have dry – tannin derived – cessations while carefully regulating spiced eugenols & smoked guaiacols against the softly spoken (developed) acetaldehydes  m: an intensity behind c₂h₆o that’s courteous to not suffocate when attenuating sweetness. thus a treacly to thick mitigation with an alleviating bite while the smooth ebullitions amalgamate over the tempered – carbonated – tiers. a feel that’s accompanied by age besides the aeriated drafts for paving a weathered maturity  o: the degradations on hemicelluloses are rich in their pursuit on furfurals above ethyl acetates which is fittingly appropriate for perceiving malt. oak compounds are continuous in the upsurge of clocked intervals as they are paired alongside the relaxed wooded hops. correspondingly a construction that offers more harmony when providing the time with an uncapped patience
7076,Assassin,4.58,very good. too much hype though
7077,Assassin,4.73,2022 version sample from a snifter at toppling goliath during stout stock. deep black color with a solid tan head. slightly sweet. seems to have smoothed out over the last few months. very thick has a fantastic barrel touch but perfectly balanced.
7078,Assassin,4.55,on tap at whiskey road cedar falls ia. served in a proper snifter. opaque deep blackish brown in color with a wisp of tan head. big aromas and flavors of molasses dark roasted malt bourbon and barrel char. quite sweet with some tannic astringency. this was the 2022 vintage which was still a little hot. i can imagine it smoothing out a bit with age but who has time to wait? overall just another world-class imperial stout from tg.
7079,Assassin,4.79,look - black thick fantastic rimming smell - chocolate bourbon woody and booze taste - whiskey chocolate slight roasted malt and booze feel - nice thick fuzzy creamy light carb overall - pretty fantastic
7080,Assassin,4.5,2022 version sample from a snifter at toppling goliath during assassin release on 9/12/2022. after first trying the vanilla bean version the standard assassin falls a little short but is still a tremendous beer.
7081,Old German,2.61,random gas station pickup in pendleton classic can art caught my eye i literally have never seen this in my life a surprising find in the west especially a not super beery town had to snag it. its not real good and i was glad to be sharing the can an exceedingly cheap and cheap tasting brew super thin and yellow thinnest beer ive had in a long time really watered down feeling i perceive that before any real aroma or flavor its minimal as they come. there are huge bubbles in this and it puts out a big head but it falls fast. some metallic character after a sip it builds a little into a not awful mineral profile no hops here at all and the yeast is obviously a lager strain but boy its light and cheap to me in this. the grain is so pale so watered down and mild boring and also so subtle its almost flavorless but it opens as it warms unfavorably into an adjuncty budget large format norm par for the course maybe slightly better than some of its peers but really very little here like beer flavored water but i dont hate the lightness or the high carbonation they kind of save this add in just a bit of refreshment value. i like the packaging best of all and will not be in a hurry to buy this again...
7082,Old German,3.17,when you want a beer but youve been working in the yard or youre outdoors fishing camping enjoying yourself youre not going to want a high gravity terminal imperial double hazy founders edition beer youre going to want something that hits the spot and goes down smooth. beers in this category are not expensive and not high abv which is good because its going to be gone before you realize that you probably should have grabbed a water too.  pours cleanly into a glass with a nice though short lived head faint grain aroma a nice light fizz on the tongue and a smooth light flavor and clean finish.  dont look to this beer to impress you look to this beer to be a nice beer at the dollar per 16 oz price point similar to pbr and olympia. this beer reminds me of oly before they were sold.
7083,Old German,4.76,this reminds me of olympia but creamier. taters gonna tate. theres way worse beer than this. good price for 6 pounders under 6 bucks!
7084,Old German,3.61,16oz can stamped 0252 0211 poured into a tall pilsner glass at fridge temp no abv listed on label. the beer pours bright light golden yellow with off white head. the head recedes to a thin uneven cap and leaves a little lacing. the aroma is pilsner malt and slight yeast. maybe a hint of orchard fruit. the taste is semisweet pale malt with a noticeable sour corn finish. maybe a hint of oxidation as well. minimal bitterness. the mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. cleanly lagered. overall ok. this can is presumably 8 months old at this point so it was bound to not be its best. i would definitely try again as all the makings of a solid aal are there.
7085,Old German,4,old german has a thick soapy head and a clear bubbly straw appearance with some fine white sediment throughout. the aroma is of funky wet grain. the flavor is of slightly-sweet cereal grain with practically no hop bitterness. old german has a medium body and a crisp finish.  rjt
7086,Old German,2.87,picked this up from the cheap foods rainbow foods outlet. big 24 oz can i think.  pours looking like your standard adjunct lager straw yellow fizzy white head 2/5. aroma was corn and lager yeast. little bit of those hydraulic fluid feels that adjunct lagers can get.  taste you can tell after the massive carbonation push is mostly corn grain and bittering hops to a lesser degree. its light bodied enough. i dig the german guy on the logo though im sure there is somehow some purple hair gape mouth selfie taker who finds it problematic. kind of makes me think of this as more of a session like country club (malt liquor). its not ever going to be a go to beer but sure man 100 degree weather id crush one of these again in between other beers as a palate cleanser if you will.  i dont think there is anything offensive here its largely one of those beers that tastes like a carbonated water boilermaker shot was dropped into a normal bmc like beer.
7087,Old German,4.84,its beer! taste like a beer should taste. if you like beer you will like old german. if you do not you will not like old german. prost!
7088,Old German,1.82,ok right out of the starting gate you know this isnt going to be a beer of any real quality. it runs about 12 bucks for a 30 pack so you know youre buying a beer to quench your thirst and probably nothing more. pours a very light yellow with a fizzy short lasting head. no aroma and a very weak body. honestly if i had tasted this blindfolded i might have pegged it as a weak tasting cream soda! the phrase used as their slogan the world knows no finer is no small exaggeration to be sure. but if you are looking for an inexpensive (ok cheap) beer to have at a cook out or something similar this beer would do the trick... but barely.
7089,Old German,3.06,i found this beer at my local distributor 15 pack for $9.99. the marketing is nothing special its a silly german caricature with a red banner.  lets be real this is not gourmet beer its a cheap (really cheap) lager you get when you want a buzz without spending more than your spare change. for that class of beer old german is actually great. i wasnt expecting much for taste but it has a decent carbonated hoppy flavor that beats anything coors or miller lite. personally i love carbonated beer so i may have a positive bias for the taste. i will say though this beer needs to be ice cold to enjoy. its not a bavarian import that tastes good warm no sir. put it in the cooler.  the best aspect of this beer is that it isnt a headache in a can like natural ice or other dirt cheap beers out there. what im saying is that it wont punish you the next day so long as you dont go overboard. overall a cheap decent tasting light beer to go along with throwing football with the pals or washing your motorcycle. id rather have carlsberg elephant but i cant always justify 11 dollars for a six pack.
7090,Old German,2.95,i had never seen or heard of this before but as soon as i saw a cheap fifteen pack i was hooked. the ridiculous caricature of a bavarian is probably too stupid to be culturaly insensitive but its close. stupidly light color and perfect clarity: this looks like store brand apple juice. nose doesnt seem to exist.  a little bit of malt sweetness and a respectable bread note. otherwise kind of watery and blah overcarbonated in the finish but for the style it is inoffensive and drinkable if generic and mediocre.
7091,Old German,2.54,i saw this in my friend’s fridge the other evening and just had to try one. never saw an “old german beer” before. um very light colored but hey it looks like beer. smell...beery in a slight way. taste carbonated water with some slight malts. it’s really hard to pull a flavor out of this stuff. feel...it had some suds to it. if you don’t want the underpowered flavor of some other junk adjunct light beer then give this one a try.
7092,Westly,3.77,very acidic. subtle apricot. based on this vintage i prefer wa.
7093,Westly,4.26,sample at de garde 10th anniversary. cloudy golden pour small bubbly head. aroma is stone fruit and grapes. taste is fruity tart with lots of funk and barrel notes.
7094,Westly,4.36,fantastic golden hue and white foam head that emits a fresh apricot orchard like aroma. the aroma is a burst of freshly cut apricots and a hint of funk. flavor is initially the fresh apricot flavor thats mostly sweet with tartness coming in behind it. the finish though is overwhelmingly sour. great overall but acidity is strong with this one which detracts a bit from the sweet apricot fruit like notes i enjoy most.
7095,Westly,3.86,look - fantstic yellowish color with a nice white head and lacing smell - sour super tartness taste - about the same as smell with some wood and citrus feel - medium body and lighter carb overall - not to bad horrible smell
7096,Pannepot Reserva,4.35,bottled and received in the post but so long ago i can’t remember from whom but either from someone at struise or a friend of somebody at struise. pours a rich dark brown body with some good off white head aroma is toffee and christmas spice flavour is plums and a note of patchouli
7097,Pannepot Reserva,4.5,i think i like struise pannepot better over struise pannepot reserva
7098,Pannepot Reserva,4.07,330ml bottle 2018 label 06.10.2020 dated (+5 years) poured into a stemless wine glass.  the beer pours a deep burgundy color cola hues with a thin finger of khaki head loose bubbles that offer no retention nor lacing. the aroma is nice deep rich stone fruits hearty grain brown bread clove fruity yeast caramel brown sugar vanilla oak raisin and licorice. the flavors are good lots of stone fruits raisin licorice strong belgian yeast brown sugar caramel lots of brown bread soft oak anise and a bit of spice. the mouthfeel is okay coating a bit thin a little more on the flat side than expected but with a hearty finish.  verdict: a nice quad from de struise. the beer could use a bit of life in the body but flavor wise its all there. delivering the type of complexity and depth that makes the quad such a captivating style.
7099,Pannepot Reserva,4.53,2018 bourbon ba version
7100,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3,12oz bottle. code on label reads 23046 ch2338. clear pale straw colored body. thin finger of white head turns to lingering cap and ring. leaves behind tendrils of lacing. aroma of grain malts including corn and barley. slight whiff of floral hops. taste is light malts including corn. slight green apple fruit. sweet overall. less than medium mouth feel. wet and clean. very good carbonation. thirst quenching but very thin on the flavor profile. no skunk from the green bottle but not much of a bite.
7101,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.26,hard to find in sc so when i found it in total wine i picked up a coule 18 packs. abig mistake. this used to be a unique and tasty brew. something has changed. now it seems hardly better than light beers. very little smell very mild taste. the only thing good is that its cold. id rather have beer with some taste thats cold. just my opinion.
7102,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3.46,presentation: 12 ounce can poured into a pint glass.  look: light golden color with average head.  smell: sweet caramelized malt aroma. moderate hops aroma and minor citrus aroma.  taste: strong hops flavor and minor citrus flavor. nice floral aftertaste. the flavor is much more distinct than i expected.  feel: ordinary mouthfeel. feels like any other american lager.  overall: this beer is prominent flavors. the taste is more complex than many other “cheap” beers. very easy to drink. if you’re looking for a “cheap” beer with a unique flavor this beer is for you.
7103,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.31,poured into a glass mug pale yellow color with about an inch of white head. highly carbonated and fizzed like a soda. little aroma or taste. got an unusual albeit brief wave of sweetness. absolutely no hop influence. it is highly drinkable but overly simple in character and i nda boring. 6 pk bottles was $7.49 + tax. would not purchase again.
7104,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.92,pours out of bottle a pale yellow with a 1 finger head. smells hoppy and crisp. taste follows suit and a nice change of pace from other lagers.
7105,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,4.2,i’m the weirdo in ky that likes this yankee beer. it’s a nice middle ground between light beer and drinking a pork chop has good taste very little aftertaste and is awesome in bottles and ice cold. will drink in can but not my fave that way. was introduced in college twenty years back and got it a couple years ago for the nostalgia… really liked it and have stuck with it ever since. better than any light and just a few extra calories.
7106,Special Herbs (Seasonal),4.17,2022-01-02 375ml bottle served in a footed pilsner. i dont see a date on it. left about half an inch in the bottle.  pours a beautiful crystal clear brass / bronze color with a medium sized head that settles quickly into a fairly generous ring and a couple clumps.  smell is fruity -- apricot peach maybe white wine grapes kind of tart slight funk.  taste is slightly fruity along the same lines -- maybe more grape or grape must flavor maybe something vaguely herbal.  mouthfeel is very light very clean very smooth very dry. overall this is a very good beer.
7107,Special Herbs (Seasonal),4.45,excited to find a bottle while in town. pours cloudy amber gold with a sudsy white head. gin lemongrass juniper pine grains spices peach tart oak red grape flowers honey and tangy earth in the taste. super complex each sip has difference ratios except the barrels being an omnipresent backbone. smell focuses more on the barrels grains spices and sour peach. feel is oak tart with textures from the grains botanicals spices wild yeast and malt. it is as if it was ground up in my mouth intense yet light and drinkable. a beer truly unlike any other inspiring!
7108,Special Herbs (Seasonal),4.24,this is the 2020 version. been sitting in my fridge for a couple of months waiting for a toasty summer afternoon such as today.  lovely pale yellow thats mostly clear and sports a soft white pile of foam that settles down slowly but surely  nose is a nice mildly tart with elements of lemon and pear and an almost berry-sweet undercurrent. they dont list the specific botanicals nor barrels on the bottle so my aromaticizer is proving less dialed in without the suggestions of a label ha! theres elements of juicy citrus and stone fruit in there and maybe the suggestion of mint but not the like cool/mentholy aspect of it? none of these are especially strong. just all around a pleasant melange of summery flavours.  initial impression does carry some of that same fruitiness alongside a flatter lemon-adjacent character. has kind of a light grape-must/wine kind of thing going on in addition to a mild apple and general tart/funk and sharp carbonation.  perfect for this summery afternoon in the pnw of transplanting and general garden-work. this is a tasty saison.
7109,Special Herbs (Seasonal),4.64,l: generic blonde. s: a start of brett with a lot of herbs. t: the strongest herbiest funkiest saison beer. f: a winter ale. o: a wacky saison with the strongest set of flavors ever.
7110,Special Herbs (Seasonal),4.41,“pacific” version.  best gruit i’ve laid my hands on. the shiso etc. doesn’t pop out particularly but adds to a strong lacy herb profile atop a light crackery base. lovely druid juice.
7111,Special Herbs (Seasonal),4.07,i absolutely love this brewery and i am so glad to see some of their bottles popping up around colorado again. this is a unique one more sour than the others that have come around recently and fashioned as a gruit without hops and using a unique mix of herbs instead. this one has a bunch of cool stuff but it comes together really well floral but dried peppery and lightly medicinal bitter but clean really clever and interesting beer. its also aged in gin and wine barrels from what i gather and i do get the juniper aspect especially in the aroma. there is a clean woodiness to this too almost new oak light vanilla and earth lumber and sweetness unifying and nice with all the herbs. this is nicely bitter but also has some freshness and is maltier than i would have expected a crystal clear light copper or dark honey color with a tall white head. the sourness is what throws me a little bit i didnt expect this to be wild so much as a saison like a lot of their others are but there is some serious citrusy acidity to this not overly sour but definitely packing a pucker. floral later on a little mouth tingling from the szechuan pepper spicy grassy and like nothing else out there. great carbonation and a slow fading finish where i can appreciate each element all over again. these guys continue to fascinate me hoping this is only the beginning of their beers showing up in colorado...
7112,Appervation,4.5,375ml bottle at share.black pour ring of brown head. aroma is roasty malts coffee chocolate. taste is roasty and bitter mildly sweet chcocolate and a healthy dose of abv.
7113,Appervation,4.54,on draft at jackie os on 4th in columbus - nice rich chocolate flavor - wish they hadnt been serving this so cold but it was far better as it warmed. black with a slight brown head - great barrel but very balanced - you can taste the sp influence in this beer. chewy finish. very very solid ba stout.
7114,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.04,poured from a bottle into a pint glass. pours pitch black with a small light brown head. smells of grassy hops with very slight dark roasted grain. tastes of citrus and earthy hops with nice chocolate notes. beer is light bodied and easy drinking good carbonation. overall a very good beer.
7115,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,3.77,poured from a 12 oz. can. has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of pine roasted malts. taste is dank pine light roasted malts a touch of alcohol significant bitterness. feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer.
7116,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.13,pours black with a couple fingers of khaki foam. aroma is sticky resin with toasty and roasty malts underneath. sticky but dark with earthy undertones. flavor profile is sticky resin and mild dank hops with roasty and toasty malts underneath. caramel and earthy flavors build as the beer warms. its a really sticky ipa but with dark stout undertones. mouth feel is medium-thick with a mild velvet fluffy texture. very low grit. overall sticky dark beer which is always a juxtaposition but in a favorable way.  served in a 15.5oz spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle. reviewed from notes.
7117,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.34,picked up a six pack pours almost black. strong flavor that was great. makes you feel great. became my go to beer for about a month. did my job to bring it back next year.
7118,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.44,great in between beer. i love stouts i love ipas. this one is perfectly in between for me.
7119,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.57,look: black in the glass with a finger of foam opaque coarse bubbles lots of lacing smell: super dank roasted coffee and pine taste: the perfect 50/50 between stout and ipa. chocolate coffee molasses caramel with a nice hoppy finish. feel: heavy and dry mildly carbonated. overall: incredible but not a regular drink. super delicious for special occasions.
7120,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.5,deep dark brown in color. nice roast notes floral. man that first sip is deep in roasty malt flavor and good hops too. caramelized flavor and some char character. medium to full and long finish. boy i am glad to finally try this and i want more.
7121,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.3,12 oz. can packaged 1/5/22 poured into a nonic pint glass.  mahogany brown color with two fingers fine tan head. full lacing curtains and 1 cm. cap. pine plum grapefruit light toasted malt aromas. citrus light licorice raisin dark chocolate light char flavors. good bitter hop mouthfeel initially more flavors appears across the tongue. great lasting carbonation. no alcohol heat. dry finish. great flavor combination with the piney hops and dark malt. always a place for this beer.
7122,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,5,i’m very impressed with stone for this one—most stone ipas have the same exact generic bitterness; however this one is different; this one has a balanced hop flavor balanced bitterness and is oh-so-smooth. pours a dark brown like the color of the glass bottle it came in yet looks basically black poured into a glass. has a head you would expect from a darker beer like this…the head dissipated but still left a thin lingering layer…the lacing is wonderful. the 8.7% abv is extremely well-hidden in this brew. honestly—this does leave your tongue longing for more sip after sip with the melody of flavors. i’m about 2/3 done with this 1 pt 6 oz bottle and i have no idea why i’m already feeling buzzed. nice work on a unique brew stone. try it while you can as it is a limited re-release.
7123,Maudite,3.99,12oz bottle best by february 2nd 2026  on the pour 3 fingers of fluffy off white head formed on top of a dark reddish brown and hazy body. over a couple minutes the head fades to a 0.5cm covering. sporadic lacing forms.  aroma is a bit hollow on the first impression. there is a strange almost metallic or mineralic earthiness before a sweet caramel malt comes though and some nice belgian yeast spiciness. there is a bit of a funk.  flavor is very nice with a slight bitterness along with a bready pumpernickel maltiness. the spicy yeast comes in strong with cloves vanilla and cinnamon not to mention the actual spices that were used during brewing. then a nice fade into a mellow sweet and almost mulled malty finish that is slightly chocolate. the bitterness fades fast.  the feel on this beer is full but dry and surprisingly drinkable for the abv. the 8% still makes itself known but in a friendly relaxing way. super smooth and cozy. it reminds me of the holidays.  overall this was a nice surprise. easy drinking and mellow for this style of beer. full flavor and cozy comforting maltiness but no clear alcohol burn make this very nice as a beer after a long day at work.
7124,Maudite,3.58,12oz bottle poured into a goblet glass. off white head falls to a light cap. rich brown color with carbonation rising to the top. smell is vinous at first. then aromas of fresh baked brown bread. taste is malty bready some caramel a bit of dark fruit. taste is fairly light and fades away in the finish. feel is light well carbonated. overall this is good but flavors kind of fade too quickly.
7125,Maudite,4.25,12oz bottle dated best before 5/24/25.  pours dark copper with a chill-haze. moderate retention and lacing. clove-studded apples with a caramel drizzle in the nose. medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. fairly malty on the palate with minimal bitterness and a earthy spicy profile. finishes fairly dry with lingering spice.
7126,Maudite,4.27,pours a rich orangish-brown with a fluffy white head that just wont go away. the first thing i smelled was bananas with a malty support. there is also a spiciness which follows through in the taste. the feel is medium and is refreshing. overall a good dubbel. i salute the damned. :)
7127,Maudite,3.74,i like their tripel much better. the delivery on this is very good but i dont like the aftertaste so much. it has a great body though and it is still enjoyable to drink.
7128,Maudite,2.89,very thick head three fingers upon pour. weak aroma of malt and spice. upon taste immediate onslaught of heavy sparking spice and malt heavy carbonation. flavor is an overripe banana with spicy burn and a smooth watery body. not very enjoyable.
7129,Maudite,4.25,this belgian dubbel pours a deep and dusky orange color with a massive off-white head and aromas of rich bread malts smooth caramel belgian yeast and spices. it has a bready taste with flavors of bread malts smooth caramel belgian orange spices and yeast. it finishes dry and yeasty with some smooth caramel and bready undertones. medium-bodied with strong carbonation and yeasty on the palate. it has a wonderful balance of wheat belgian spices and orange citrus with some caramel sweetness. overall an excellent example of the style.
7130,Maudite,4.4,draught
7131,Blushing Monk,4.02,drank a 2015 in 2023 look - dark burgandy with a pinkish tan thick head smell and taste - nice tark milk raspberry feel - medium body slightly creamy overall - aged well
7132,Blushing Monk,4.39,drinking a 4 1/2 year old bottle of it and it is still damn good. still has carbonation and there is plenty of fruit flavor and bite to it. the alcohol is disguised extremely well. an excellent example of the style. have to see if i can get some more of it one day.
7133,Blushing Monk,3.74,12oz bottle served in a tulip glass. bottled on 11/24/20 17202. i just bought this and i can see why it got lost on the shelves. its a white date stamp on a pale off-white label. not real smart. lets hope im not about to regret my life choices with a really old beer.  appearance: hazy/murky copper-red color with a thin white head that died back. a few islands of lacing here and there. sadly not the best looking beer.  smell: definite raspberry note. a little bit of underlying yeastiness and some funk as well. starting to wonder if 2 years after bottling this is taking on some lambic character.  taste: so not a lambic - its not that tart/sour. definite raspberry note with some underlying aspects of a belgian tripel (herbal leafy hop note some muted belgian yeast character). i feel like the belgian character may be somewhat lost here.  mouthfeel: good thickness quite sticky and somewhat juice-like. light carbonation. still - it held its carbonation this long.  overall / drinkability: for a beer that is over 2 years old....its still got some of its original character but the belgian character is mostly swamped out from the raspberry that still dominates this far on. so for an unexpected cellared beer its okay. i will see if i can score a fresh bottle and try it again - but note to the brewer: use a laser / ink system that puts a black date stamp onto a white label.
7134,Blushing Monk,3.78,pours a clear light pink color smell has raspberry vanilla yeast and vanilla . taste flows nose with raspberry front  followed by melon vanilla and stone fruits . . mouth feel sweet with some yeast funk slight tartness .
7135,Blushing Monk,4.37,it’s clear and the color of pink grapefruit. the raspberry smell is very evident and pleasant. taste more like a cider than a beer. the raspberry comes through strong and at first it’s sweetness is immediately up front but followed by a sour on the finish. gives the flavor a beautiful experience. make sure you coat your entire tongue this hits so many different taste buds. nice!
7136,Blushing Monk,4.17,pours rose\ with a 1 light pink head which lasts. moderate lacing.  aroma is floral raspberry. belgian yeast.  taste is wine like. raspberries belgian yeast sweet.  medium body lively carbonation. sweet finish.  an interesting take on a beer.
7137,Blushing Monk,4.39,bottled on 11/23/2020 drank on 5/3/2022 so may need to revisit this when i try a fresh one. but for those of you curious about how it held up read on- poured reddish amber deeply hued and sported a manila colored 1 cm head for a minute or two leaving behind a thin ring which left regular lacing. the aroma is still all about the raspberries. but there is a secondary note in there that reminds me of all things angel food cake. hmmmm. the flavor starts out strong with raspberry but later mellows to a semi sweet malty ale that is sheer pleasure to drink. the angel food cake shows up in the flavor as well very curious and very tasty. the feel took me back a bit far more viscous than expected but that\s likely on me. this is a fruited strong belgian ale and a little viscosity isn\t misplaced. just unexpected. maybe fresh the carbonation balances it out more. oa so glad the released this again sorry i picked an old one to rate it with but once its open ya drink it!
7138,Blushing Monk,5,absolutely love it hopefully it turns into a year round production!
7139,Blushing Monk,3.66,this is a very very berry beer—appearance sip scent all scream berry bomb. enjoyed on tap at the source after trying it in the wild for a number of years.
7140,Blushing Monk,4.12,very red in color  plenty of raspberries in the nose.  raspberry with a bit of yeast and tartness  medium thick mouthfeel.  pretty similar to ng raspberry tart in my recollection. nice change of pace but nothing you can drink a gallon of.
7141,Yanjing Beer,1.36,bought at liquor shed.  pours a pale gold with nearly a finger of foam lacing is very good.  the smell is umm of rotten vegetables with a sickly sweet aroma and smells light struck.  the taste is a nasty grainy sweetness vegetal non goodness plain terrible.  thin and watery body.  yeah it is a single bottle that i bought!
7142,Yanjing Beer,3.94,poured from 12-ounce bottle into a stemmed glass goblet. crystal-clear pale amber with a couple of fingers of snow-white head that left some nice lacing as it settled. comforting aromas of grain grass and tart apple that obtain on the palate as well. the light malt provides good structure and there is an unexpected but pleasant umami note (however slight). fairly light bodied good carbonation clean finish. overall an excellent euro pale lager. i wish i had me some chinese food right about now. :)
7143,Yanjing Beer,2.82,found this at binnys on its build-your-own 6-pack shelf and had been there for a couple of months. (not likely to return.) i wanted to try it and i did and i wont again... unless i can find it fresh. while yanjing has a decent personality i had it next to off colors si fang (designed for dumplings.) on a relative basis yanjing just lacked flavor; i suppose designed for refreshment but not as a contributor to the kitchen.  to be consistent i owe yanjing one of my micro reviews but i\ll keep it short: i couldn\t find the english button; so i only could review some superficial macro marketing. hence below average overall rating.
7144,Yanjing Beer,2.86,cool to run into a bunch of random new to me asian lagers last week i have long been a fan of the international lager experimentation game much as these are all the same they also all have their own little personalities and quirks and its fun to drink through them in life. this one is very light close to ruined in the nose from the green glass not my favorite packaging decision but who knows if this was ever meant by the brewery to land in idaho a long way from home to be sure. its immediately frothy and very well carbonated practically leaping out of the bottle which is appealing. past the skunkiness its got a simple cereal grain base seems like all malt nothing cheap or extract-esque about it not even metallic either which so many of these are and i can appreciate a little continental ale yeast this almost has czech pils elements to it in grain and yeast. the faintest herbal hop and balancing finish enough to be quenching and crisping if this were fresh but alas it is not. oxidized and with wet paper character still its oddly clean on the swallow it goes away fast but its skunky enough to be a bit unappealing even when its frosty cold. cool to get to try this one the malt character and its effervescence are its best features but i like it having a touch of body too and dont mind trace grain sweetness. perhaps better than most when its nice and fresh hope to try it that way next time...
7145,Yanjing Beer,4.88,i had this beer in china and it was my personal favourite. liked it better than the other chinese beers. easy drinking and nice and strong. its typically drunk when youre eating spicy asian food. the general reason is that it helps to clear the palate in a refreshing hydrating way so you can move on to the next spicy dish. thats probably the reason why its so popular in china especially for chinese food banquets. so if youre having spicy asian food you really cannot go wrong with this beer. it is in my opinion a hidden gem that i was glad to discover.
7146,Yanjing Beer,3.39,i normally do not do lagers but this one was pretty good. it’s complex and has a sweetness or fruitiness i couldn’t peg. i’d get again.
7147,Yanjing Beer,3.38,12oz bottle from brewers haven. very pale gold with a nice tight rocky head lots of lacing. grainy malty aroma some corn. taste is sweet and more grainy flavors and lacking any vegetal notes you usually get with cheap lagers. tasty smooth light.
7148,Yanjing Beer,3.83,let’s be real: the beer is what it is. i’m not going to call it a chinese heineken but it still isn’t gonna win me over like kiera knighlty in a nightie. what i like is that my homeboy down the street at the liquor store told me to put it in the freezer for 20 minutes before i pop it. and you know what i got? ice cold nothing! which is better than regular cold skunk.  i’ll drink to that!  ...honestly i kind of like it!
7149,Yanjing Beer,3.44,decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; no production information. a: pours a crystal clear straw to golden color with a two finger foamy white head decent retention but spotty lacing at first although it picks up lower on the glass. s: peppery and toasty with grainy (especially corn) and grassy aromas. t: semidry. fruity (apple and corn) and very lightly malty with a surprising degree of bitterness given the style and area of origination. m: light bodied with very solid carbonation. drinks smoothly crisply and cleanly. o: this is a solidly constructed lager without being stand out. it is no longer in the clear bottle as depicted above but rather in a green one (which is no improvement from the perspective of skunking. the absence of a production date is a problem especially as it is an import and trying hard to penetrate the american market.
7150,Yanjing Beer,2.44,pours a clear medium yellow that resolves to faint lacing. smell is fairly strong sweet corn malt. taste is skunky sweet corn malt and slightly bitter finish.
7151,Consecration,4.2,served from a tap in a clear pint glass its modest biege head didnt last long. the brew is a deep brown-amber almost mahogany bright and surprisingly clear for all the color. the only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales. the barrel tannins dominate even the brettanomyces and currants to taste. no minor feat. yet the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected. there are too many sours that are really some degree of tart. this is also a little tart but its unmistakably sour. the woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste. other than that theres no complaint here. the high abv isnt noticed the taste is full and complex delivered within a body thats rich for the style.
7152,Consecration,4,good sour and barrel flavors.
7153,Consecration,3.01,375ml cork-topped bottle bottled on 090622 and served in a stemless cbc glass. brilliant ruby color with great clarity and little head. inhaling through my nose i get hit with a powerful whallop of sourness. oh boy. yes the flavor is sour too. its more balanced than i would have given it credit for based on the aroma and the first sip. but its fizzy and tart without much flavor to my palate. i dont get fruit i dont get wine barrel. i dont get chocolate or tobacco or any of the other flavors printed on the label. but i also dont get ethanol and at 10% abv thats really saying something.  i feel compelled to finish this beer but please take it away from me.
7154,Consecration,4.34,look - brownish orange with an initial head fizz smell -tart acidic with a wine wood taste - tart fruity woody slight acidic and citrus some spices and dark fruit feel - full body crisp overall - pretty great
7155,Bière Du Démon,3.94,typical high strength belgian beer. wont be to everyones taste but remember how its supposed to be drunk - sipped in the same way as a spirit. two of these with a meal will last you the evening.
7156,Bière Du Démon,2.25,de club del gourmet de el corte ingles de el duque. lata. en copa alhambra. viendo la casa de papel 3x03-05. suave dulzor alcoholico. sin estar mal el exceso de alcohol y tamaño dificilultan terminarla. si al menos tuviese mas riqueza de sabores...
7157,Bière Du Démon,1.48,330ml bottle as a gift from france: shocking stuff & awful tasting throughout the nose definitely wasnt as bad & came through very slightly better than expected but still wasnt exactly great but the taste was beyond bad. coming through as a mix of strong alcohol grain & the odd pale malt the beer was chemical-like in taste with an overpoweringly sickening taste & it meant it was one i struggled to drink even a fraction of before pouring it down the drain; only its appearance (& to some extent the nose) saved it from being one of the worst beers ive ever had.
7158,Bière Du Démon,3.68,woooah there boy! this tipple is likely to tipple you over the edge!  mega strength beer and excessively so. i actually think its not too bad better than some belgian tripels. a tall slim glass keeps the head and served chilled takes a bit of the harshness away from it. it has a citrus aspect for me and given the strength is remarkably smooth to drink. dont be put off definitely worth a purchase if available. a couple of these and youd be safe sleeping under a bush in the park on a cold night.....thus saving yourself a taxi fare to boot which can be added to the coffers for sampling a few more brews. every cloud and all that!  i came back to re-review this one after a second sampling and down graded it a touch. it is still way way better than the reviews on here and i think labelling it as a euro strong lager somehow assumes it will be naff right from the get go! but there is the anti-snob in me.
7159,Bière Du Démon,2.15,pours a clear maize color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. slight retention and slight lacing. smells of strong alcohol slight dark citrus and grain. fits the style of an euro strong lager. mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. tastes of strong alcohol slight dark citrus and grain. overall weak appearance alcohol completely dominates poor body aroma and blend.
7160,Bière Du Démon,2.68,colour: light gold clear. white head durability fatal immediately disappears. aroma little crisp malty with a hint of honey and plenty of alcohol. taste: no surprises first alcohol the second 12% alcohol continue as in the aroma alcohol plus gentle malt and honey. gentian alcohol low. high saturation.
7161,Bière Du Démon,2.62,i read a couple reviews here and the bière du démon is rated as poor. maybe thats a tad harsh just in my opinion. for a french strong lager and as far as i know there arent many of those its slightly above average. yes 12%abv is a lot and especially for a lager. its a beer i gave a try or two already and wont buy the six-pack assuming its exist. a cheap buzz if you are around these parts. for the same brewery though i suggest goudale instead.
7162,Bière Du Démon,3.28,aroma is very malty and hints at high abv. color is clear golden with thin but sticky head. taste is sourish and  hints of honey and plenty of alcohol burn. mouthfeel is right and despite alcohol burn overall texture and palate is very smooth. but beware the high abv for a small bottle this is potent stuff....
7163,Bière Du Démon,2.87,advertised as the strongest beer in the world this might be the booziest euro strong lager but with 12% abv its far to be the strongest beer i ever consumed. very boozy nonetheless and cloying
7164,Double Bastard Ale,4.31,strong biting ale. light copper color. thin smooth consistency. a better big brother to the regular arrogant b*@tard ale.
7165,Double Bastard Ale,3.85,this stuff is rugged. not my favorite style but apparently a good representation of it. just too much hop bite and burn for me to truly enjoy. definitely a fun time trying it out though!
7166,Double Bastard Ale,4.2,this is a good one. taste like a big hoppy loaf of raisin bread in the best way. big and beautiful and surprisingly clean. i could drink this one all night until i pass out
7167,Double Bastard Ale,4.21,2016 vintage  here we go beer number 666. and a 101oz bottle at that. i paid over $100 for this but i think it’s gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy. let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open!  pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  this has definitely lost its intense hoppiness over time but this honestly smells great now like a lightly hoppy barleywine. im picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar molasses toasted pecan earthy hops caramel golden raisin and light toast  where it was charmingly old in aroma this is a bit too old and faded in taste. its not necessarily bad but its showing significant age. on the front end of the sip im tasting earthy hops fusel alcohol caramel malt and light fig. the swallow brings notes of brown sugar toasted pecan brown bread and nutty malt  a medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness  its not the best beer in the world but im still happy to have gotten this big bottle. ill have to see how i feel after finishing the big ass bottle
7168,Double Bastard Ale,3.75,650 ml bottle cardinal pub & bar stavanger. abv is 11%. hazy reddish brown colour moderate off-white head. strong aroma of american hops piney notes also caramelized orange marmalade some alcohol. very hoppy flavour medium sweet caramel and alcohol. bitter finish hints of solvent.warming mouthfeel. there’s plenty of hops in this one (surprise surprise) but this is probably not where you go when you look for balance.
7169,Double Bastard Ale,4.75,65 cl. bottle bought at the situation some years ago. served at home in a snifter glass. pours a hazy brown colour small head with short retention. no lacing. boozy aroma caramel dried fruitslicorice molasses hops pine some citrus. medium to full body creamy texture no carbonation. dry sweet and hoppy finish taste of caramel licorice molasses chocolate hops citrus. a beast of a beer.
7170,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.94,seeing the tape get pulled off the menu listing for the 2020 bottle at the cantillon bar definitely got the old heart pumping. as the freshly horizontally uncorked bottle rested in its lambic basket it began to slowly push a soft mauve foam out of the spout before i gave it a tilt to pour a damn near smoothie-like stream into the glass. there it displays fully opaque garnet with a dense cotton candy head.  i said st. lam was the juiciest loon? scratch that this is like schaerbeek puree with mild hints of cinnamon marzipan delivered on a pillowy body with a surprisingly balanced acidity. even still a complex oak tannin brings us to a bone dry finish before exhaling a touch of black pepper and perhaps chevre. a delicious candied quality further emerges as it warms.  im not sure i ever imagined just what made lpk the highly coveted fruited lambic that it is but clearly that distinguisher is decadence. this is undoubtedly the thickest lambic ive ever had and in all the most delicious ways.
7171,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.64,cradled 750ml bottle served in decanter sat for ~20 minutes then served into glass. pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. aroma is cherry forward but not in a fleshy fruit forward way instead delivering a rindy dark pit. its morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. complexity is notable without any overtly sugary tendencies. flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. cherry is present with a tart twist. stone followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. again the complexity and depth is just amazing. for a beer blended with cherries it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. it verges on bubbly at least at the onset. overall cherry notes here are just a delight swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. it refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.  2018. served from a 750ml bottle. decanted. reviewed from notes.
7172,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.65,drank in the night of 31st december 2021. last beer of the year.
7173,Samuel,4.9,2020 vintage at the brewery bottled.  white head. lace. clear yellow gold color. beautiful beer.  a bit tart a bit citrusy but refreshing and balanced. green apples white wine and grapes. earthy wheat light saison spice but not like a belgian saison. more subtle. fruity but drinks like a white wine. fairly dry but bubbly.  very enjoyable and worth the hype. can’t believe i finally got to try this one.
7174,Samuel,4.66,this is mild honeyed sweetness light lemony great funky and super smooth.
7175,Samuel,4.73,b3 bottled 8-27-20 poured from a 750ml bottle into a sp “cheers” stemmed wine glass. pours a foggy orange with a fluffy white foam head. foam dissipates but lingers as a thick white foam collar around the glass. aromas of white wine lemon honey hay oak all in perfect harmony. taste follows with a bright lemony tart finish. full mouthfeel. as it warms it takes on more white wine qualities. pleasantly tart. perfectly carbonated. amazing beer.
7176,Samuel,4.94,slightly foggy but bright yellow with a soft white head that retains well.  insanely refreshing and softly effervescent up front it starts with melon and peach characteristics but then subsequent sips allow subtle farmhouse funk and oak to develop while even adding hints of passion fruit seed as it warms. the medium-light body then comes to a bone dry finish.  batch 4.  ---  on the evening of march 10th 2023 i had the pleasure of enjoying a batch 2 bottle thanks to the contrite generosity of a long lost friend ultimately coming away enjoying it even more than b4.  here an oaky funk pairs with an impressive array of stonefruits and pear accompanied by a beautiful bouquet of herbal accents including a hint of spearmint making for an absurdly unique yet ever delicate expression. unlike b4 i do actually feel that i perceive the faintest hint of buckwheat here which provides a satisfying comfort in a small but substantial way.  this beer exhibits such unbelievable balance and complexity that it may be their best barrel aged saison and i find myself increasing my already very high score of 4.76.
7177,Octoberfest Beer,4.12,copper/gold appearance with off white foam that dissipated in a minute or so. initial mild aroma that deepened as the beer warmed. nice drinker touch of malts come though balanced by a dry smooth finish. would purchase again.
7178,Octoberfest Beer,2.91,golden-amber smell is grassy and mild the taste is toasted barley malt with hops in the finish that give off a metallic bitterness very drinkable expensive
7179,Octoberfest Beer,3.75,9/4/23 on tap at pies and pints in morgantown.  beautiful deep copper look with beautiful tan head  aroma is metallic stone. light underlying malt.  taste.... slight bitter to start and finishes dry and nicely balanced in bitterness. malt finish is good. a very decent offering with a slight toastiness with low sweetness which is a plus for us!
7180,Octoberfest Beer,4.35,12 oz. bottle best by: 01 nov 23  poured into a tree house glass a pretty nice clean/clear golden amber color pretty nice carbonation with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger off-white head which also leaves a pretty nice medium size island and some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. the nose is pretty nice malty hoppy with some pretty nice toastyness slight cherry spicy. the taste is very nice malty hoppy with a pretty nice touch of toastyness cherries spicyness. medium body abv is hidden pretty well with a pretty nice dry/bitter finish. overall this is a pretty tasty beer.
7181,Octoberfest Beer,3.44,beer tasting notes  bells octoberfest a: copper/orange matches the label. slight head minimal lacing modest carbonation s: get the rich malt right off the bat not particularly roasty or hoppy t: good malt flavor a bit of biscuity again no roasty quality i can make out a touch of hop bitterness. not a strong flavor doesnt last strongly on the palate though there is a pleasant residual flavor. could pound it all day i guess they market it as a session beer so i would agree m: medium mouthfeel some fizz from the carbonation o: pleasant but lacking roasty character leaves me wanting
7182,Octoberfest Beer,4.23,my favorite oktoberfest of choice. made me try more beers as well.
7183,Octoberfest Beer,4.36,this pours a rich malty amber brown. generous head retention. the nose has some caramel malt and a touch of green hops. low bitterness but what’s there ties things together on the sip as well.
7184,Octoberfest Beer,4.5,sweet caramel notes. one of the easiest drinking marzens i have had. not extremely bitter but enough to have a lasting aftertaste moments after a drink. great if youre looking to drink more than one as it is not overly powerful.
7185,Octoberfest Beer,3.69,not overly sweet or malty. lighter in body (and taste) than others in this style. i prefer this to the overly heavy us offerings.
7186,Octoberfest Beer,4.34,my favorite octoberfest beer for 2022. bells continues to produce some very good beers at volume quantities. very smooth very drinkable and very tasty.
7187,Octoberfest Beer,3.48,1.5 x 12 ox ml bottle bottle date 07.15.2022 glassware: 0.5 l festmug temp at pour: 52.8 f abv: 5.5 % ibus: 24   look: the color is clear medium copper with what seems to be gold highlights. the head starts as 2+ fingers of frothy and fizzy off-white foam that quickly dissolves to ring-and-islands. decent lacing in on the glass.  smell: lightly toasted grains and bread and lots of them. there is also a dry crackery note. faint notes of fresh-cut grass flirt in the background as does an equally faint spiciness.  taste: a quick hit of sweet caramel comes at the start but is quickly submerged (for the most part) in toasted malts and grains. an earthy spiciness and moderate bitterness then arrive and the sip begins to dry out. the sip finishes lightly dry somewhat spicy and moderately bitter.  feel: crisp with a slightly astringent finish. the body feels between medium and medium-light.  overall: a shade or two (or three) too bitter for your typical märzen (especially a german one) but quite drinkable nonetheless. it is not too sweet or caramelly nor overly bitter. so it is a decent to solid american okto. which for me is equivalent to saying a nice mid-to-late fall/autumn amber lager.  my ratings are primarily for this beer as a märzen. i would score it higher as an amber lager.
7188,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.45,2017 vintage - shared with me from a friend. small 2oz pour for each of us. served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.  appearance: clear dark amber-copper color. no lacing (there wouldnt be at this abv).  smell: boozy - bourbon barrel notes honey toffee. rich.  taste: lots going on. definitely some barleywine notes with some bourbon oak vanilla toffee honey orange raisin and some bitter notes at the finish as well.  mouthfeel: surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. good thickness no carbonation dry finish and only a little warming.  overall / drinkability: i can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer and i almost want to call it a barleybrandy. its got aspects of a barleywine but so much more. glad i got a taste of it. not sure i could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. unique and quite tasty.
7189,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.65,i opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago this is my third pour. time for a review.  i love how hybridized this is it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. i can see calling this barleywine on steroids. beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. smokey wood and tobacco raisin/plum schnapps? plenty of brown liquor hints of vanilla and honey plus...just so much more. the body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.  damn i wish i didnt like this as much as i do. there is just no way to justify buying another bottle but this is absolutely worth trying once.
7190,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.76,2019 vintage  pours a still dark mahogany amber red brown with notes of rich toasted nuts warm roasted malts sweet maple syrup pecans walnut dark dessert wines port sherry madeira some cognac liquor cherry toffee caramel bourbon oaky char hints of baking chocolate red grape mild bitter herbs caraway subtle spice raisins dark dried fruit brown bread fruitcake and a touch of vanilla. feels medium-full bodied slick oily strong and smooth. overall a real great and unique barrel-aged sipper.
7191,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.5,had multiple years. very unique and a must try for beer lovers just nothing like a beer. more like an after dinner port than a good scotch but really enjoyable. great conversation beer for a holiday party although quite costly.
7192,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.59,not sure its worth the price tag but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. its super solid and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but its its own animal. definitely glad to tick this.
7193,Cuvée De Castleton,3.86,2017 vintage
7194,Cuvée De Castleton,4.49,decanted from a 12.7 oz (375 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; 2017 vintage. a: pours a clear golden color with a short-lived with large bubbled white head disappears rapidly. no lacing at all. s: sharp. aromas of apple pear vanilla and chardonnay grapes. t: semidry and pleasantly tart. flavors largely follows the nose. very drinkable. m: medium bodied with medium carbonation. goes down very easily. o: well made highly palatable sour which i could see in numerous pairings. a bit pricey.
7195,Cuvée De Castleton,4.23,2017 bottle has higher 8.4% abv. great sour with. strong grape notes and smell. some toasted oak. although this brewery has better options - hops n’roses.
7196,Cuvée De Castleton,4.38,great grape prefer this to rosso and hops n roses. all other beer/wine hybrids could learn something from this beer.
7197,Sculpin,4.42,this beer and bell’s two hearted ale are the best two widely distributed old school ipas in america. this one leans bitter and the other leans sweet. both are exceptional and difficult to surpass. cheers!
7198,Sculpin,4.57,it’s my favorite among american ipas. has slightly sour taste but comes across as very fruity. unfortunately this beer (and the grapefruit version which is perhaps the even more gifted sibling) is hardly ever available around where i live.
7199,Sculpin,5,this is a ridiculously good beer. unfortunately we cant seem to get it any more here in texas. bottles are always better than cans.
7200,Sculpin,3.4,pour clear and golden but the head doesnt last long. aromas of apples and light flowery with medum strength. taste is juicy enough but im getting a bit of harshness like carbonation. i dont get the high ratings of this one? not very thick in the mouth. feels like carbonation when you leave on your tongue.  overall - i will not buy this one again. just not that impressed.
7201,Sculpin,4.57,this is the best west coast american ipa i have ever had. the hops taste crisp and go great with food - particularly crabs fried seafood and steak. truly a world class beer!
7202,Sculpin,4.61,one of my favorites!
7203,Sculpin,3.78,12oz can pkg 031323 (2 months ago) poured into a spiegelau ipa glass at fridge temp 7% abv. the beer pours bright light amber with light khaki head. the head recedes to an irregular ring and rocky cap. slight lacing. the aroma is mild with light citrus pine and caramel. the taste is bittersweet piney citrus with relatively weak caramel malt. strong bitterness. mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and mostly dry finish. overall good but not the world class ipa it once was...
7204,Sculpin,4.15,great san diego ipa. lovely goldenrod color big bouquet aroma big head that lasts most of the way through the glass. its lovely. plenty of apricot lemon and maybe cantaloupe aromas big piney-lemony-tropical hop flavor nice viscous body. this is a winner. cans were on sale -- i never pay full price for sculpin. its great for them that they have pricing power and can extract a $2 3 or even $5 price premium per 6-pack but there are probably ten other ipas i enjoy as much or more and theyre cheaper. if i can get in for $12/6 sculpin is a solid choice. thats not very frequent which again is good for ballast point brewing.
7205,Sculpin,3.9,not a big fan. too floral malty. carbonated
7206,Sculpin,4.43,classic west coast ipa honestly prefer this one over the iconic stone ipa give both a try and see which one you like the most
7207,Sculpin,4.08,smells great with an exquisite finish. with a citrus like smell. hops pull through and is strong and lasts until aftertaste. solid beer but prefer the visuals and smell over the taste.
7208,Bar Fly,4.57,yesterdays meandering around through the bottle (!) backlog took a detour into the canquest (tm) however gloriously briefly but today it is back to/on the bottlewagon. 8=( my recycler must be astounded this past month+ since i rarely fill the bin but i have been doing so on a weekly basis since ~ 16 march. usually i am laser-focused on cans & those get set aside for a ~ quarterly visit from jeff lebo over in york county for his massive canlection. all is not lost however as most bottles contain things that i did & still want to drink. especially the barrel-aged beers and even more especially the non-whiskey barrel-aged beers. they give me an opportunity to delve into my liquor cabinet where it normally remains closed with its contents merely gathering dust. sigh. my advancing age has softened me up so that i no longer desire shots. i will merely pour a wee dram & sip on it over the course of the review for a point/counterpoint. this is one such beer.  from the bottle: somber and smoky barfly saunters into the room slowly. thick smoke. cool swagger. good wood. too much brass. sticky leather. slow glances. lingering looks. the only thing that didn’t make the glass was maraschino cherry. bring your own and wear out your welcome.; alaska’s most wanted[:] midnight sun crafts some of the most sought-after beer in the world. this line includes creative successes from several themed beer series as well as amazing one-offs. we hope you love our very special brews as much as we do. a gracious thank-you to our longtime \every weather\ alaska fans for year-round love & feedback.; bar fly smoked imperial stout; ale brewed with smoked malt molasses and brown sugar aged in bourbon barrels; 45 ibus.  i was very anxious to pop! the cap & start a slow gentle c-line pour since i have been on a smoke beer kick lately. i watched in rapt fascination as it foamed up to form two-plus fingers of dense foamy rocky deep-brown head with excellent retention. color was stygian black/opaque (srm = 44) allowing zero light penetration. nose reminded me of smittays smoked bourbon maple syrup! 8=o sweet smoky boozy woody all at the same time! 8=o mouthfeel was big full & creamy like a dollop had been scooped into my mouth & onto my tongue! the taste was a masterful blending of smoke what i would have mistaken for maple syrup & a woody bourbon flavor. 8=o its smokiness was not as intense as say its alaskan smoked porter counterpart but this was not intended to be that (i hope). still it was far smokier than simply being an ais. i was not pairing it with bourbon a) because i did not have any on hand (i prefer rye) & b) it was a subtle bourbon flavor where the smokiness was quickly becoming the superstar especially as it warmed. phew! the brown sugar gave it a maple quality helped along by the treacle. this was quite the drink. i found myself falling into drinking it like liquor a wee sip at a time.  i could have poured this into a schooner glass at this rate! ive to see it in this day & age but a schooner (~ 10 fl. oz.) was an option when i was a wee lad especially for those on the go. have a quick schooner & be on yer way.  the more i sipped on & of this the more my thoughts returned to ak. id been to ketchikan & anchorage while in the navy but it was my 2008 trip to ancak that really bore fruit. i had a lovely couchsurfing hostess who worked at la bodega & we did an early pre-morning raid during my visit. they had la dragonne on closeout (!) & i bought a bottle to exbeeriment with. it actually calls for warming in a double-boiler & when she returned home we (her housemate & two other surfers + meself) ha a steaming cup ready. the house smelled magnificent & upon trying it she called her boss & had all remaining bottles set aside for us! 8=) the other lasting memory is of my partaking of salmon. when she picked me up at the airport i was gnawing grilled salmon on a stick. the following morning i made salmon scrambled eggs. she called me at humpys as i was in the middle of plank-grilled salmon for lunch. by the time that she picked me up i had candied salmon on a stick for us. she was flabbergasted! i ate salmon for three straight days & could have eaten more except that i had to get back conus. drinking this put me in mind of both the smoked salmon & the candied salmon. yum.  finish remained fashionably smoky slightly bourbon-y with a sweetish treacle/maple syrup/brown sugar quality. for all of that though it was still quite dry. the smokiness left me feeling as though i had inhaled a nearby house fire. not in a bad way but the smokiness was prevalent & unabating leading to an inherent dryness. ymmv.
7209,Bar Fly,4.29,the smoky aroma is stronger than it follows on the tongue but this is a damn good stout in its own right. probably second to berserker and still a ways behind some of the others at the top of the stout game but midnight sun truly does its thing a little different and you will undoubtedly find some originality here not the same sad attempts to copy the greats. i think you will be pleased especially for the price.
7210,Bar Fly,4.16,midnight black body topped with a dense creamy light brown head. nice roasted grain and cocoa aroma. rich flavors of mild chocolate fudge subtle booziness; vanilla bean. heavy body; rich dense and creamy; velvety (almost sludgy); alcohol heat to counterpoint the chewy sweetness; coats the palate.  i dont pickup up any smokiness per se but the heavy chocolatey sweetness and bourbon-barrel aging meld together nicely.
7211,Bar Fly,3.5,bottle at 2018 ris share. dark black pour small beige head. aroma is roasty chocolate ash. taste amps up the ashy smoky notes gritty dirty earthy woody.
